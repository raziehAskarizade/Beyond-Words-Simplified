2,Great CD,"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?"""
2,First read,"Up until this point I had only ever seem Muppet Treasure Island. This book is actually pretty cool, certainly worth reading given that it comes for free with the kindle."
2,Treasure Island,A classic. Everyone should read this book...and all things written by Robert Louis Stevenson. He is one of my favorite authors of all time.
2,treasure island,treasure islandis an awesome book I just couldn't stop turning the pages. Many people died but its still action-packed with thrills.
2,Treasure island,Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
2,A Great Adventure,"I loved this book. I never read this one as a child, but I wish that I had. This book causes the imagination to run wild. I can see Treasure Island in my mind's eye! Well worth the read."
1,"Good book, of course, difficult to use audio link.","Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car. However, we could not figure out how to get the audio link to work.Disappointing."
2,How could I never have read this before?,This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
2,Classic,"Great read. The writing style may be considered a bit dull by today's standards, but I really liked reading this. This is the original pirate adventure book. Yo ho ho!"
2,Works Great,Tripp Lite INTERNET550SER 550VA UPS Compact Low Profile Standby 8 outlets w/ DB9 PortWe have been using our Tripp 550SER since October 2008. It meets our expectations for a great surge and small back up power supply. It would be nice if there were an option to turn off the beep alarm when the standby power is running.This is a great unit.
1,A Total Waste of Money,"I've used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works. When the power goes off, so does everything plugged into this Tripp Lite battery backup. THEN the battery backup kicks in and starts beeping. Real useful. Total waste of money and could ruin your expensive computer equipment when you think that you are being protected from power surges and outages."
1,are you kidding me?,"This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane.. honestly, why would you sell these?"
2,moka brew coffee,"Bought this product after drinking great coffee in Amsterdam that was pressure brewed,[senseo one cup],and this machine is close but no cigar.The taste from this machine is better than drip machines but not as frothy as the Senseo.Senseo draw-back is buying your coffee in those pods,very expensive.This machine is low pressure,maybe the difference in taste."
2,Good book,"This product is pretty good. It lists so many websites available. It is mostly aimed at older homeschoolers, but there are things in it for all ages."
2,The only...,"I ordered this book simply to replace the original book that has come unbound from years of use. I've been reading cards for close to 25 years now. My first deck was given to by my mother when I was an adolescent. I've come across many decks over the years, and have yet to find one that compares to the ""Old Path"". I mostly work with oracle cards now, however I use the tarot for precise information. The Old Path refers to pre-Christian era, when the Goddess was the divine deity. The cards are beyond beautiful and definitely feminine without being feminist. They have a beautiful balance between male and female. The cards relay precise information without being too harsh. These are my tarot for life. BLESSED BE!"
2,Rush 2:Better than rush exept for music and tracks.,"22 Cars(including 6 to get from keys, Mountian Dew, and circuits), and better graphics. !Warrning! Bad tracks compared to rush. HEY!!!!! Where's the music that i like?"
2,Good Movie!,This is a very old movie but it made a deep impact on me because it's very spiritual. This movie teaches how temptation can be deadly. I always like movies that leave you thinking and this one definitely does that. It's sexual in some parts and in other parts it's exciting and filled with suspense. I love to show this movie to my friends because most of them have never seen it before. I would recommend watching this movie on a dark stormy night. :)
2,Women are pure evil,The demon from hell that looked like a woman is praying on single she meets in bars in New York. Everytime she takes a man home with her while she having sex with them she starts to kill them. It takes a christian boy from the south to stop her evil deads.
1,Didn't like the paper quality and presentation,"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."
2,Definitley worth a read,Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
1,Shoddy quality,"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."
1,Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read,"I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an 18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read."
2,A wonderful novel,"Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to ""persuade"" her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!"
2,An excellent recording from Naxos and Juliette Stevenson,"To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too ""nice"" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it."
2,Love Kindle!,"Everything was as expected. Timely delivery, great condition, worked as prescribed. If you question this product or this particular vendor, sleep easy. They are great! Thanks again! -w"
1,Not the best,"Like all Jane Austin novels, this was very class conscious, overly verbose, and difficult to relate to for a modern audience. It lacked the charm of some of her other books and the story dragged excessively. A long and wordy read, I would recommend reading ""Sense & Sensibility"" instead."
2,Persuasion: Austen at Her Best,"Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Ugly Duckling."" How does Anne Elliot deal with her ""faded bloom?"" Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the 1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture."
2,Always a pleasure,"Watched the movie 10 or so times before reading the book. Just finished second reading. The humanity of it is so engaging. Misunderstandings and assumptions abound. People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up. How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory."
1,"The tape, I'm afraid, is very bad indeed.","I bought the tape with delight, but found that I can not listen to it. Whatever producers do to reduce the hissing of the 's' sounds, these producers did *not* do.Just the first few minutes of the first side were extremely distracting and irritating. I couldn't imagine the actress - whose voice is really lovely! - talking about the 'ssea' and Lyme Regissssss by the second half of the book.I am sorry to have to say it, but there it is."
1,Doesn't work!,"Maybe we just got a bad one, but it doesn't work. The flower barely fits inside the wand (too wide) and gets stuck, and the magnet isn't powerful enough to pull it back out. My son was pretty disappointed with it, luckily it was just a stocking gift!"
2,One of my all-time favorites,"Listening to these recordings gives one the same feeling as one would have re-reading love letters that have been carefully tucked away. The very best tribute to Ella Fitzgerald there could possibly be ... Tommy brings these beautiful tunes to life with his incredible style of playing. This isn't a recording just for fans of Ella or Tommy ... it's a must-have for anyone who enjoys good, uplifting music."
1,"Nice idea - poor quality device, firmware problems","After endless hours with Lingo and Dlink support I give up. There are firmware issues with this device, and Dlink and lingo point fingers at each other.Low volume, dropped calls, and frequent need to reboot the device.If you want lingo, don't use this device, get the standard box they provide."
1,"Destroyer is Non-Anamorphic, Send a Message","Pick up the individual Conan the Barbarian SE release, but don't support this lame packaging of that disc with a non-anamorphic release of Conan the Destroyer. I was excited about picking this up, but declined once I realized that Destroyer was not enhanced for widescreen televisions. Would it have killed the studio? What a disappointment."
2,Go Conan!,"All of the Conan movies are great, and no one fits the bill better than Arnold ;) There are some scenes in these movies though, that are....exposed....lots of nudity that I had never seen before....but that's ok, I could look at Arnold all day ;)"
2,Quality Product,"Well built and makes delicious coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Easy to use and loaded with features. Menu is user friendly."
2,My Second Keurig,"Liked the first on so much, I bought a second one for the office, now I can enjoy my favority coffee all day."
2,Great for a single guy,"Pros:Easy to use.Just the right ammount of coffee.Simple clean up.Good Selection of coffees.Great Customer Support.Cons:Coffee is a little weak, need to use two pods if you want it stongPods can be hard to find and expensive if not ordered from Amazon [...]Broke within two months. (Wouldnt register Pod, went through all the troubleshooting, but 'K' sent out a replacement ASAP and no problems since.This is the perfect at work coffee maker or for someone who's the only coffee drinker at home. Its great for the coffee drinker who values ease of use slightly ahead of taste. The coffee could be a little stronger.Go with the bold stuff even if you like mild coffees!"
2,"Love, Love, Love my Keurig!","This baby makes a great cup of coffee with no mess, no waiting, and no waste. It couldn't be easier! We are fairly picky about our coffee. We would grind our own and it had to be Eight O'Clock Columbian Roast and fresh. My husband thought a Keurig cup might be a nice occasional stand in for his regular pot, but after trying a wide variety of K cups from the sampler packs, he's found a new coffee that he likes more than his fresh ground Eight O'Clock... Caribou Blend. We also love Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold. My kids have been having fun making hot chocolate as well as using just the hot water (hitting brew without adding a K cup) to cook their cup of noodles."
1,Forever Breaking-Have Gone Through @ Already!,"I received the Keurig B70 for Christmas. I loved it for a few weeks. Then all the problems arose. I called customer service and had to hold for over an hour. They gave me the run around at first but then offered to ship me a completly new machine. I thought that would be the end of it, however, THE REPLACEMENT MACHINE IS BROKEN NOW TOO! Listed are the problems both machines had:* Both turn off right after brewing a cup, no matter how the settings are.* Both Eventually turn off right after they are turned on.* Second Machine (1 week old) leaves grinds in the cup and brews partial cups. The waterpump is not drawing water.* Now the second machine will not even brew.Have tried everything the manual says-Nothing is working!Now I am stuck with two broken (expensive) machines that WILL NOT WORK! I am on hold now with Keurig for the 9th time holding over 40 minutes now.DO Not Buy Until they fix the TERRIBLE glitches in this machine!"
1,Stopped working properly after 1 week,"I loved the machine itself but after approx one week it started to brew a 4 oz cup of copy using the 7.25 cup size. In addition, every other cup was luke warm at best. If it worked as it was intended I would recommend it highly but instead I am extremely dissappointed at the poor quality of the product.."
2,best b-70,this is my second one B-70 for the money is the best brewing system delivery was fast and free
2,Keurig B70 Platinum,Great delivery service and terrific price! This arrived right before Christmas as gift for my husband. We both are enjoying the coffee maker. We can pick our own coffee choices. It works great. We both love it!!!
2,This was gift,"I bought this last Christmas for my Daughter and Son in law, Replacing the old one they had. they are thoroughly enjoying it."
1,Dont waist your time or $$,"My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday, and today is Sunday and it will not brew a cup. It is like the water is not getting pushed threw to the 'down spout'. Same problem as the last machine that only lasted 3 days as well. I totally thought i had to be a fluke! But i will not be getting the same machine for a 3rd time. Sad, without coffee!!!"
1,Price is rediculous..,Costco has the same machine for $145 with 60 k-cups... Just rediculous.. Starting to sigh on amazon.... Prices this season have been jacked sky high...
1,What is the opposite of Green?,"In a world where we have floating islands of plastic. How does this type of product even get patented, let alone sold and popular? Each cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, has a plastic cup that, you guessed it, gets sent to the land fill.I have seen these becoming more popular, instead of doing away with such a trash producer, like I would love to believe this world is moving towards.There must be a better greener way to make coffee! Please don't buy this!I can't give it a star, I wish there were negative stars. (I guess I have to give it one, because it won't let me post without)"
2,LOVE IT!,I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!
2,Review,"Product was shipped on time and arrived as advertised - all works great ......... we were worried initially with the coffee maker as the first few cups of coffee had a metallic taste, but after cycling water thru a few times it tasted normal. We love the coffee maker - very convenient. Glad we purchased the larger model with a bigger tank of water - would have taken too many refills with a smaller capacity tank....... wish there would have been a non-commercial product line that had an option to connect to a water line.We love the little individual cups of coffee and the variety. I have found that it's easy to cut the top off the used cup, wash it out and put any brand coffee in it. Then I cover with a round piece of aluminum foil as a cap - works great........ a lot better than the individual cup holder we purchased........ only trick is to line up the puncture hole on bottom when inserting the cup in the holder."
2,WOW - MUCH BETTER THAN THE B60!!!,"I purchased the B60 about a month ago and was relativley pleased at the ease and convenience of it. I no longer had to make a pot (or 1/2 a pot) of coffee wondering if my husband was going to have any that particular morning or not. And then measuring, cleaning and throwing away...etc. Just a pain with a house full of kids running around so early in the morning! But I recognized that I had to brew at the smaller of the 2 sizes with an extra bold coffee to get close to what I liked. THEN, we received an early holiday gift this morning, and lo and behold, the B70!!! Right out of the box and at the 3rd cup size (which is 9.25 oz.) the taste was AMAZING! And actually a bit stronger than the smaller sized cup from the B60. I'm not sure if it brews it a few seconds slower, but all-in-all definitely worth the extra $50 or so for this model over the B60. I wish I had bought this model in the 1st place!"
1,Worst coffee maker,"I bought the keurig about 2 years ago and without fail the company has had to send me a new one every 6 months. The brewer works great for about 1 to 2 months and then goes down hill from there. Read all the reviews, look at the time frame the people have owned them! The good reviews are from the people who have owned them for 2 months or less! They have sent me 4....thats right 4!!!! replacement brewers and all do the same thing! Customer service has to go through the same process every time, I think I know them by name now. They defend this piece of junk and the bad ratings by saying they sell so many of them that they have to expect some problems....really....YOU ARE CHARGING $160 BUCKS!!!!! This brewer is a piece of crap....look at the Hamilton Beach instead....SignedKeurig Sucks!"
1,It's not working well.,We were very pleased with the B-70 for about l1/2 years. But now it is failing. We did all the suggested fixes but it is still giving us problems. Called Keurig and they said we will sell you another one for $117.00. Don't know if I want to buy another one if it is going to go bad like the last one.
1,NOT worth it - tons of problems,"I am so upset about my coffee maker. I received it for a gift in 12/09 and for the last six months, it has randomly shut off, made inconsistent sized cups of coffee, and required me to become very creative with how I get my morning cup of coffee. I have descaled, I use bottled water and I have cleared the pin on so many occasions - I feel like a Keurig repair man. Nothing is worse than having to scream for your coffee in the wee hours of the morning. I had high hopes and the quality is sub-par for such an expensive coffee maker. The web is filled with discussion boards of the same complains and it is my understanding that Keurig is ""surprised"" with every phone call to their customer service. Wish I could recommend the machine (as I did to many people when I first got it) but it is NOT a good purchase. Lasts about six months on average from what I read on the web."
1,Platinum series is terrible,Bought a platinum series brewer. Wish I had never done so. Have to keep constantly unplugging and restarting to get it to work correctly. Piece of junk
2,Christmas Present,I bought this coffee pot for my daughter as a christmas/birthday present. She wanted it because they had one at work and loved it. She said the one I got her was even nicer then the one at work.
1,Unreliable and Unpredicatable.,"This product is unrellibale and unpredictable. Multiple problems; makes a full cup intermittently. You never know when you get a full cup or a half cup. It also deposits coffee rinds in the cup of coffee, intermittently. Lastly after using this product for about 10 days, it stopped working. The word Prime displayed on the screen, and followed manufacturer's recommended guidelines to correct, which it did for about 3 cups and then stopped working. The only thing that works; it makes noise like a constant motor running and would not shut off, nor does it make coffee. Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,What's the point? Long term revenue.,"I recently experienced one of these appliances at my office where I was really impressed. Although we had to purchase our own K-Cups they ended up being relatively inexpensive ($.44/Kup) for the price of convenience. And so, I decided to purchase one for home. Then the problem started... K-cup prices skyrocketed... DOUBLING on Amazon to about $.90/Kup. I'm a sucker. I really wish I would have returned it. But I am far beyond the Amazon 30-day return policy. And so, the Keurig has been tossed into the garage sale pile.However, our Keurig has proved to be invaluable when anyone in the house is sick with the flu. Chicken broth, tea, and even Theraflu is effortless. If you have a home where this scenario is common, this appliance is perfect. But, the cost of the Kups are way to high for this to be any value."
2,Keurig B70 Coffee System,"I am so happy with my Keurig B70 Platinum Coffee system. I am mostly impressed with the easiness of it's use, and the quality and reproducibility of each and every cup of coffee I make. I highly recommend that every household have one."
2,Wonderful,"Very happy with this purchase. Easy enough to set up. I really like being able to set the beverage temperature. I like the highest setting at 192-degrees for my beverages, but others in my family don't, and they are able to have ""cooler"" hot coffee."
1,Yes it's short-cupping,"Well, now we are a little leery about replacing, but we have invested in about 5 boxes of K-cups (taking advantage of sales at Kohl's) soo..this is going back to Costco tomorrow. We read the reviews but thought that the newer models had replaced the older ones-guess not. We had been using bottled water entire time so we knew in 2 months it wasn't a build up issue. It's short-cupping and going back."
2,Keurig B70,I am very pleased with my Keurig B70. It easy and fast to use. I love the different varieties of coffee and tea offered. I now can enjoy a cup of coffee or tea anytime during the day without the hassles of a conventional coffee maker and so I do. I do miss it when out of town. I am considering getting one for my small office staff so they and I can enjoy it at work.
2,Wait for Product,Had to wait 6 weeks from Amazon for this brewer. Then the order was finally cancelled so I bought it from JR and got it in three days.
1,returned,I returned it. It was broken when I received it. I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff. I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything. I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.
2,brewer is very stylish,"Let me say this brewer is very stylish, extremely simple to use, and has bare minimal clean up however, the coffee does not have any richness or flavor. It is very watered down."
1,I CANT BELIEVE I ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I must say that I absolutely hated this story. I describe this book with three words and these words are...pointless and confusing. Trick of the Eye is extremely slow for the first 80 pages and then after that the story gets so mixed up and confusing that you can't understand it. This book was so confusing I don't even know what the story is really about. And as and ending note, I would like to say that the first 80 pages could have been written in eight!!"
2,What a cool album...,"Mark Isham has a gift for capturing, even setting, moods. His pieces evoke feelings and moods. Not quite background music but not quite music you actively listen to, his music allows parts of us to arise, giving us pause to reflect, to wander, to dream.This is the soundtrack for a great movie but the soundtrack stands on its own. It is exploratory and adventurous. There are several jazz/blues numbers on it but there is also some experimental music that is difficult to categorize. It is at once entrancing yet challening. That may sound a bit technical but the one word that describes the whole thing is 'cool', as in the jazz kind of cool.There aren't many like this one to find. That's what makes it so good. If you are looking for some creative and different music, this is a great place to wander."
2,Plano Four Handgun Case,"All I can say is WOW! These are some pretty big hangun cases! For the price, these cases will do the trick. Also, keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The hinges are completely plastic so if the cases need to last for a while be sure to take precautions by NOT overloading, stacking, or excessive opening & closing. They will fit 4 semi- autos or 2 large framed revolvers comfortably. I will not advise putting more than two semi-autos on the same level. And, only one large framed revolver on one level because shifting does occur (although minimal) to avoid scratching or scraping metal surfaces. There is a space for a padlock! And, the foam is durable and safe for all handgun finishes. If you need a handgun case for multiple firearms, I recommend this product. If you have a special firearm with lots of accessories or bulky parts, BUY this immediately to keep things in one location and in reach. Overall, I rate this product 4 out of 5!"
2,Good value,"might not stand the test of time, but at this price you cant go wrong. Great for camera equipment, and handguns."
2,Great storage case,I actually didn't get this for pistols. It works great to store our electronic depth sounder and fish finder with all its cables and attachments.
2,A book for all ages,"I'm 12 but I really like this picture book. I learned a lot about what Henry Thoreau was trying to do when he built a cabin by Walden Pond, and it was fun learning it through this book. The illustrations are funny and I like how Henry solves his problems. I also like Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, which is even funnier because Henry makes his friend learn a lesson in a funny way. I also recommend another great book about Henrey Thoreau, that especially girls of all ages will like, Louisa May and Mr. Thoreau's Flute. It talks about how Henrey Thoreau helped Louisa May Alcott learn to like the outdoors and learn to like writing. Henry's funny in that book too so I think readers will like it too."
2,Wedding Goddess is divine,"Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful, altruistic sense rather than how the machine of the wedding industry commercializes it. Laurie Sue is a minister who customizes weddings to the individual--there's no pat formula here, just two people in love coming together in the way that makes them feel most connected. This book is for those who are getting married but also for everyone who wants to open your heart and honor the committment to yourself and humanity."
2,Scary for Grown Ups!,"Before ""Leaving Las Vegas"" Mike Figgis directed this rather nasty adult thriller which features Kim Novak's most recent film appearance to date. She's brilliant in this small part as a dying woman reunited with the son she gave up for adoption. As she slips into morphine induced dementia, he stumbles into...incest?...adultery?...ghosts?... I'm not sure but anyway, my blood ran cold for weeks. This is recommended especially to people who miss Ken Russell's exuberant directorial excesses!"
1,For Collectors Only?,"This is far from being the best NRBQ album available. As the ""best bar band in the world"", they have made a series of loose but imaginitive and fun recordings. Later, when they tried to make ""serious"" recordings, some of the fun may have been missing, but this was made up for by top-notch writing and interesting arrangements. This project is neither tight nor fun. ""Me and the Boys"" is perhaps the only memorable song. The singing and playing are lacksidaisical, and overall it seems like the whole band would rather be elsewhere. You might want to skip this one unless you are a die-hard fan."
2,A Different Sequel to American Graffiti.,"Most of the Original Cast are back, expect for Oscar-Winner:Richard Dreyfuss. This film tells the tales of Seven Friends (Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins), which they are in Different Situations in the Evolution of the Mid-Sixties.Directed by B.W.L. Norton, this is Surprisngly Well Made Sequel. Written by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, George Lucas and Bill L. Norton. This has a lot of Bright Moments. Harrison Ford has a Cameo as a Motorcylce Officer and Delroy Lindo, then Unknown has a Scene with Actor:Smith. This was a Small Hit in Theaters. Some Might have a hard time watching this film, because it`s filmed in Different Aspect Ratios of this Film. Part of the Movie is Filmed in Panavision. Grade:A-."
1,No where near the Original,"If you like the original. You may be disapointed. I was. I wanted to see a real continuation. What I got was meany hard to follow snips. I think the director could not get them all in one place again. So, they wrote small movies for each."
1,Not as Good as the Original!!!,More American Graffiti is kind of sad to me. It shows how everone is living in 3 or 4 time zones. It's sad that Terry the toad's girlfriend forgets him and becomes a hippie. The ending is the most sad because you know John Milner is about to die because of a drunk driver. I probably wouldn't recommend MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI!!!
2,All The Great Oldies!,"Wow, all the great oldies from the movie. And arrived very quickly, even though Standard shipping was selected."
1,A clear look at Islam,A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
1,Horrible reception,"I had this hooked up with digital cable. I tried going through the regular cable line and S-video. Going through the regular cable line resulted in an awfully grainy screen. Going through S-video didn't make it any less grainy, but it completely washed out the color of the signal. All the whites on the screen took over the other colors. Do not go with this card."
2,Amazing Immune booster,Cats Claw is such an effective immunobooster that the AMA has listed it as a drug to avoid in the case of organ transplant. I'm sold.
2,jumpstarter,Fantastic product! Good value. We can say nothing negative about it. We carry it with us on trips. Family members borrow it. Wow - what more can be said.
2,"Works well so far, radio needs improvement","The powerpack delivers but it promises. Portable power, both DC and AC. Trickle charger and the light work well. I haven't had any problems with my unit yet but the radio definitely needs improvement. Although it has a digital tuner, adjacent stations seem to overlap. Also the speaker is very small."
1,Xantrex 852-2000 XPower Powerpack 600HD Portable Battery,"I was disapointed. I had hoped it would hold a charge for a lot longer, but it didn't. I used this in a craft booth to light 4 strings of Christmas lights and a tree. It only lasted about 4 - 5 hours. When the battery began to run low, it ""Buzzed"" really loud.I wish I had picked the bigger one."
1,Worst product I have ever purchased,"My Xantrex XPower Powerpack 600 Heavy Duty is not good for an emergency. It is an emergency. The unit does not hold a charge. It takes days to fully charge and loses its charge by 10% each day.Xantrex customer service has not been helpful other than to say that I should charge it through my car cigarette lighter.I ask, what should I do charge it all the time. Thats the only way their will be any power when you need it... I bought this item to help if I have a problem... It is the problem."
2,Keep one in your trunk,"I purchased this product to use primarily in case my battery died, and secondarily as a portable power source when camping or away from a source of electricity.The powerpack works great when starting any size car with a completely dead battery. The built-in inverter is great to charge cell phones or run small appliances when camping for example.The display is very useful, showing either the percentage charge or the real-time wattage being used.Be forewarned, though, that this item is heavy and portable only inasmuch as it has a handle. I wouldn't lug it too far. Also, while charging is quick through the cigarette lighter cable, it takes a long time through the AC adaptor.Overall, a great purchase."
2,"Really great, but...","I used this unit in my travel trailer for about a year before it was stolen. I ran my TV off it, laptop, and when tent camping used it for lights and my laptop and to recharge camera batteries.PROS: Does what it says. Solid; built like a Sherman tank. Idiot-proof. TV ran for about 3 hours, laptop about 4 hours, and 15 watt light...forever. Started my car instantly. Plugs high-quality, very solidly built.CONS: WAY heavy; incredibly heavy. Takes forever to recharge, even on car charger; don't believe the stats. The radio and light on the unit are useless and incredibly cheap."
1,Readout Never Worked ;-(,"I've had this product for about a year. The readout that tells you how much charge is left never worked!When I first got the product, the readout didn't seem to work according to the directions, but it took me some use to figure out it didn't work properly. I could find out how much charge was left, but it didn't display the info as the directions stated. The item is so heavy and bulky, I decided not to bother returning it and just live with the inconvenience. . .Now, after three or four camping trips worth of use, the readout doesn't work at all! There's no way to find out how much charge the unit has remaining. I just have to find out when it dies. Not very convenient at all."
1,Somebody Help,"I have nothing but trouble with the battery company that sent the power pack 600HD. I have never been able to charge it because of a defective charger. They cannot send me a replacement because they do not have one. They want me to pay full postage to send back the defective charger. They offered me a choice of replacement or junk and refund. I chose junk and refund since it is impossible to send such a heavy thing back at my cost. I bought this in August and have not received a refund, am being charged with interest, and have a $325 item I cannot use. When I called ""Mark"" he told me I was unreasonable to talk to and to call back when I calmed down. HELP. I only want to charge what I think would be a good battery to take camping or stop charging me and calling me unreasonable."
1,THEY TRY BUT THEY CAN'T,"They try hard, but they can't make Van Damme seems like a good actor. The plot about twin is a clever idea, but it doesn't work at all. Bad..........."
1,A Real Snoozer,"Hard to believe that someone could take one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century and make it this mind-numbingly boring. Written with an overly verbose, convoluted style, it just never seemed to get to the point. NOTE to future authors: three page end notes have a name - THEY'RE CALLED CHAPTERS. The text reads like a caricature of a blabbering communist from an old movie from the Fifties in Hollywood."
1,Ten Days That Shook the World,I read a lot of history books and I just found this very boring. I gave up after reading 50%.
1,Giant Disappointment,"Hilary Mantel has a unique ability to tell a story through the conversations of her characters. The book is carried along by each character's thoughts and words. This story told in the Irish dialect of its subjects, is at times amusing and often poignant, but ultimately depressing. Frankly there were no surprises in this story. It ground along with the giant and his retinue heading for their predictable end.After reading Mantel's last book, Bring Up the Bodies, I was really disappointed in this one. She has certainly honed her craft since this early work."
2,DreamCatcher!,"Jonesy, Beaver, Henry, and Pete are four young friends who save a boy named Duddits,who had a syndrome. They helped Duddits from other boys in another words they were his protectors. From that day they found a special bond between them who immunes them with each other.Every year they go up to Maine for their annual hunting trip.While they were their they saw strange things happening, and witness, for the first time, creatures beyond their imagination. Soon they found out that they are taking part in alien invasion. Two friend died during the book Pete and Beaver. The other two friends Jonesy and Henry save the Earth from contaminated water supply with a disease called Byrus. In ending they found out that they saved the world by aliens from their friend ""DreamCatcher,"" Duddits."
2,Satisfying King,"As Stephen King gets older, his books get bigger, as seems to happen to most authors. Sometimes though, they fail to satisfy. This one did not.Coming off of his horrible accident where he was hit by a van, King included a lot of his pain and feelings of growing older in this book. It makes the book more personal, and more refreshing. There is the true Stephen King in the emotions of the characters.Being an alien invasion book, I enjoyed it too for it's unique spin on alien life, and how they might invade. I don't think this was overall as creepy as some of his other works have been, though this certainly had its moments.All that said, the book wasn't literary greatness, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It was a horror novel by King, and it was entertaining. I wasn't expecting anything but that.But I'm glad I read it. Well done."
1,"SK's worst ever, really 0 stars","I hated it. Bad plot, poorly delivered, terrible book. SK has written some really good books, but this one was so bad I have not read another SK since. I do not believe would even be published if unknown author. Don't waste your time!"
1,Tried to like it...,"As a huge fan of early Stephen King works, I had heard that this was so much like ""IT"" and ""The Stand"" and so I was excited about reading it. In my opinion it was totally vulgar and I don't think that all that vulgarity was necessary to create the story. I found the book to be confusing as well, towards the end. There were times when I had to stop reading it as I felt sick to my stomach....maybe that's a good thing??!! King is still in my opinion an extremly great writer but I thinkat times he tries too hard to be gross. All in all, I was disappointed...hopefully the next one will be better..."
1,Not His Best,"Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but ""Dreamcatcher"" joins his other two bombs, ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" and ""The Talisman"". The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said ""In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out"". King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it ""Thinner""."
2,One of Stephen King's best novels.,Definately one of the best books I've read in awhile. Even though the book is long the story grips you and you can't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
1,Gak. . .,"I've been reading S.K. since 1980: I'm pretty well acquainted with his writing. Sooo. . .This book is really, really bad. The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed. I can see the book on my shelf with the bookmark about fifty pages from the end; can't bring myself to finish it.I'm warning everyone away from this one."
1,Makes Tommyknockers look like genius,"I never thought I would say this, but this makes 'The Tommyknockers' look like a really excellent book... this is not up to par with King's recent offerings such as 'Bag of Bones' and 'Hearts in Atlantis.' King goes for the the gross-out in this book, and leaves the reader cringing with graphic images of various bodily functions. I am a big King fan, but I cannot in good conscience reccommend this book."
2,Audio CDs are Copy Protected,I thought the story was great. Jeffrey DeMunn does an excellent job reading and acting it. Be advised though - you will not be able to listen to these 20 CDs on your computer nor will you be able to rip them down to a single MP3 CD.
2,Very Good,"While I would not say this is the be all end all Stephen King book, I think traditional King fans will be pleased with this new offering. It is a throwback to It,and Tommyknockers and I enjoyed it much more than both of those. In a nutshell the story is about 5 friends, one having Downs Syndrome who is also a powerful Phychic, He in a way passes his gift along to his 4 friends who must use their skills to survive an alien invasion while hunting in the woods. It is very scary at times at really gross to (which is good to some people :)). In closing I will say you will never be able to sit on the toilet without thinking twice again."
1,His 15 MINUTES ARE UP.,"I was a die-hard SK fan until about 4 books ago. He's lost his touch. I so wanted to like this book, but it's bad, really bad. Incomprehensible and all over the place, and much, much too long. Sorry, Mr. King."
1,Not as good as most of his books,"I have always been an huge S.K. fan. I was disappointed in this one, however. It starts out good, but towards the end it becomes long, drawn out and boring. I had to make myself finish it. The concept of the book is good, and had the latter part of the book flowed as easily as the first part, it would have been very good."
2,Riveting! Reads like a true crime thriller!,"Fast paced book. Though I have no connection to finance, I was intrigued by the story on the back cover and began reading. It's incredible that this is a true life story. The only dry part was at the end with the criminal trials and some of the finance was hard to follow but I just skipped over the technical mumbojumbo. This guy is innocent."
2,it is very good,"i like this dvd, and the service was good,and it came when they said it would. i wish there was a fourth season of this show.i would get it."
2,Perfect for a Companion Piece to a Young Man's Wallet,"I purchased this for my grandson as a companion piece to his wallet. He makes sure he carries this everywhere along with his wallet. It prevents carrying a lot of loose change and it's very appropriate for a boy to carry since there is nothing 'girlie' about it. My dad always carried a change pouch too since he couldn't stand loose change jingling around in his pocket, and my grandson enjoys it for the very same reason. I highly recommend this product."
1,Squeeze coin Pouch,Nice leather. The squeeze portion broke immediately and I was never able to use it. Overall not a well designed product.
2,How Fi Dance!!,"Whoa!! This DVD is tight work, for real. This DVD breaks everything DOWN SO WELL (BLASE, SIGNAL THA PLANE, LOG ON, ON LINE, EXCEPT THE HEEL TO TOE). I cannot wait for Vol. 2 to come out. The LEARN segment is cool for real, but the SEE segment is off tha chain. This DVD is worth the money if you are seriously trying to learn the dances, but if you are just trying to see the dances then this is not the DVD because the SEE segment is not showing anything but 'sex in the club with your clothes on'. I have never seen anything like this in any of the Reggae clubs that I have been to, but hey not every club is the same. How Fi Dance is cool with me."
1,Good recording of a forgettable concerto,"This would be a reasonable purchase for one with intense desire to complete a Yo-Yo Ma or John Williams collection. However Williams' cello concerto presents many problems for the listener, with poor development and often monotonous forays into atonalism. The technical aspects of the recording and Ma's performance are excellent, but far more beautiful compositions have been written for this instrument."
1,shafi,I have been looking for a book for my children to share thorugh illustrations and imagination the stories of my childhood when it came to the Legend of the Old Befana. I found this to be the closest so far yet it does not follow through on the tradion that follows the Befana each year in Italy. It did not captivate my our my son and I found myself having to more explaining than sharing The drawings are nice though.
2,This is a must for all du Maurier fans!,"If you enjoyed her classic, Rachel, then this book is a must. Once again Daphne du Maurier succeeds in evoking the mystery and charm of Cornwall by setting her intriguing characters and rivetting story plots in this beautiful area."
2,Just what I needed.,"This was high on my Wife's Christmas list and it was reasonably priced, can't ask for much more than that."
2,the gift,"my favorite Christmas music, hard to find. was glad to be able to find it at amazon at this price."
2,Gödel's Proof,"The copy I read is the edition of Nagel and Newman's 1958 book revised in 2001 by Douglas Hofstadter, author in 1979 ofGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. Nagel and Newman do a good job in their first six chapters of orienting the reader towards Gödel's proof, and give a clear overview of the proof in their detailed chapter seven. They don't overwhelm the beginner (for whom the book was written) with the painstaking details of the proof. They don't describe the construction of a formal language or discuss recursive functions. I think the book deserves its status as a classic of popular mathematics and I recommend it as a first look at Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.For an accessible look at the historical background in mathematics and logic to Gödel's work, see Morris Kline'sMathematics: The Loss of Certainty. For a scholarly biography of Gödel, see John Dawson'sLogical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Godel."
1,defective product,"I have used other Yves St, Laurent Touche Eclat products, but thought I'd try the peach. I am very disappointed. The color itself was very harsh, and after the second attempt to push the button to get the product released into the brush, it quit working entirely. I assume the product was old, but under any circumstances it was defective. From now on I'm buying this product in a store where I can return it."
2,three powers,"the power of three is a very good book the amazing combinations of life and fantasy are exsqisit and although i am not all the way through i am already searching for another,i am a reader that likes every type of fantasy, but i like the strongest the best so when they learn about electricity i got kind of dissapointed but other than that it is a terrific book."
1,Side Effects,"In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However, I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications. If you are, you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb. The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks. It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick. The same day I stopped taking this product, my symptoms went away."
1,Can't hold a candle to Billy Blanks,"Don't waste your money on this one. I wish I could get my money back. Poor taping quality, poor instructions, poor everything!"
2,Rush Revealed,"I have been a Rush fan since I was in Jr. High back in the mid 80's. As I became older, I realized what a powerhouse of talent these guys are. This documentary is well put together, and despite what others have said....it does not seem rushed to me. It tracks the band back to friendships that started before the music. I found it very interesting and all in all a touching story about a group of good friends who have shared the struggles, highs, tragedies, success and fame while making some of the most complex progressive rock music in history.All three seem to be just simple good guys, and that really comes through in this story. Awesome music and a real ""suck it"" to the industry that didn't really want them to succeed.Great....just great."
2,Rush fans will love it,"Both DVD's are great. Make sure you watch both. I understand the band personalities much more now. It covers from the very first high school gig thru and after Peart's family loss and the band reuniting.If you like RUSH, you really NEED to watch this."
2,The Greatest Band in the Galaxy!,"Having been a fan of Rush for nearly thirty years, this film/documentary was truly enjoyable. The directors did an outstanding job capturing the human side of these three musical pioneers. Well worth the wait!!"
2,Must see rock film,"Not one for hyperbole, and hard to please, quite frankly. I feel like I've seen it all. But Beyond the Lighted Stage truly is one of the best rock films (the best?) AND documentaries I've ever seen. I've now watched it twice and I liked it BETTER the second time!We live in a mixed up, tortuous world. But a beautiful world too - where good people can get together to do great things. And - do it their way. What a great story. Neil Peart's Dad's comments about the day he joined Rush - man, if that doesn't get you fired up and warm your heart, nothing will."
2,Awesome!,"What a great DVD for Rush fans. The early videos are great. The number of musicians that have been influenced by Rush is huge. They truely are a unique band--love them or hate them. One of the best things in the video is the dinner at the hunting lodge. I couldn't stop laughing! Those scenes are worth the price right there. Alex has a tremendous sense of humor. I think the most important thing these guys have is a true friendship for each other and they don't take themselves overly seriously. Really, a must-see for Rush fans."
2,Rush Fans Grab this You will LOVE it,"If you are a true Rush fan you will really Love this, it gives back history and shows that these 3 guys are truly Rock Gods that don't get the glory and praise that they desirve. After all this time they can still write and preform truly outstanding,meaningful music that will just kick your ass, They have infulinced rock music more than most and yet the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame still won't see how truly outstanding they are, maybe they should watch this DVD."
2,Great video,"Tremendous career retrospective from a band like no other. Very, very well done, as with Dunn's other work. I am a huge Rush fan, and like any, this gave some unique perspectives deeper into the band, tied up some loose ends--and left a few more mysteries in our grasp. Bravo!"
2,obviously talented,"This is a good disk. In fact very good. However it's a bit frustrating because there are flashes of absolute and utter brilliance....Then there are parts that are a bit forgettable.In a just world ""couldn't you tell"" would be a top 10 hit on the radio. ""Emily's dead to me"" is quite delicate and beautiful. ""Hide, run away"" is also very good. This guy definately has a knack for creating hooks and emotional tension in his songs."
2,Clearly one of the best debuts of 05',"BC Camplight didn't make a perfect record but his debut ""hide, run away"" clearly marks the arrival of a true talent. His writing style, which has been compared to Burt Bacharach and Randy Newman, along with his macabre lyrics and humorously modest approach are a winning combination. Check out this cd if you are a fan of Todd Rundgren, Brian wilson, Randy Newman, Burt Bacharach, and Belle and Sebastian."
1,Not as advertised,"My son is very disappointed because the illustrations on the ""Look Inside"" feature are nowhere to be found. It is possible that this may be the best story ever written but please deliver what is advertised. Have a fabulous day.I called Amazon and some lady with a thick foreign accent answered. She was very nice and had a good handle on the language. She assured me that she would send a copy that matched the description on the website. Unfortunately I received the same book. There are no illustrations in this book. This is a bad experience with this book but I still love Amazon."
1,Not the best telling,"I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest. The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either. The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's ""King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table"" from the Puffin Classics series. I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations. Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or ""dumbing down"" that often occurs in youth literature.Get Green's version. It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny."
2,"The ""Citizen Kane"" of Canadian Frat Movies","Just like my title said, this movie is the ""Citizen Kane"" of Canadian Frat Movies. It's ultra raunchy, made up of fart humor, vomit humor, getting people high at a funeral, among other things. It's politically incorrect, and darn proud of it. Catch it if you can."
1,"Terrible graphics, OK recipes","As soon as I opened this book, I didn't want to make any of the recipes, simply because the pictures were so awful. The layout is amatuerish and the photos are simply unappetizing. Presentation counts almost as much as flovor- if this is what my meals are going to look like, then I'll pass."
2,WE ALL NEED TO READ THIS ONE & PASS IT ON!,"WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one, you may rethink your reality. Perhaps we all need to read this to make sure we haven't overlooked some significant details! This should be in EVERY school, EVERY hospital, EVERY clinic, EVERY doctors office and every child protection agency office. If you suspect Abuse- get this book. You will gain valuable insight and will be able to see things you might otherwise have missed!"
1,Not the best study guide available,"I used this book in a TOEFL preparation course for about a month and found it a bit disappointing. The book's explanations are quite technical (which is sometimes helpful, especially in the grammar section) but my intermediate-level students all found the practice exercises in the book too easy. The CD-ROM practice tests, on the other hand, were too hard. Some of the Writing section's explanations were good--especially with thesis statements and conclusions--but the Reading section was ridiculously banal. In addition, there aren't enough practice tests, especially in comparison with other TOEFL study materials available on the market. For the price you're paying, you'd be better off buying Longman's Complete Preparation (for intermediate to advanced students), Longman's Introductory Preparation (for beginner students), or Barron's TOEFL book with 8 practice tests."
2,Homework review,"This is a great book by Edgar Allan Poe that is filled with great ""Poe""ms. My favorite is the poem called ""The Raven."" Some of the poems are a bit scary, and there are some scary pictures. I would recommend it for ages 8+. There are also poems that you can't find in any of Poe's books because they are shortened versions of larger, unabridged poems. Also, some of the poems have to do with death. Thanks to Brod Bagert, (editor) Carolynn Cobleigh, (illustrator) and of course, Edgar Allan Poe."
2,very good.....,"if u dnt read at least one work of edgar allen poe by the time ur 30, u mite as wel b pronounced brain dead...."
2,An abbreviated collection of Como's Christmas songs,"This CD has only 10 of Perry Como's songs on it. If you like Perry Como, you should get a bigger collection, or buy this one for no more than $6 brand new. It is a small album, but if you're a big fan you could pay a small price for it and be happy with it."
1,Not as I remember,I used to watch the Perry Como show as a kid and thought he was cool back then. This CD was a bit disappointing - I thought the music was listless and didn't have quite the Christmas spirit/enthusiasm as I had hoped.
2,"""The Mummy"" by Marion","I was a big fan of the orginal ""Mummy"" and was anxious to see the remake. The first time I did I laughed! I thought it was so stupid I'd never care to see it again BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. The next day I wanted to see it again, and then again. I ended up seeing it about 7 times in 3 days, I was that hooked. And the music is so fantastic I rushed to get the CD. Plus I got the book! This is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen; and it's a unique combination of horror and comedy. But one question: If Imhotep was all wrapped in linen, HOW did he scratch ""Death is only the beginning"" inside his sarcophagus? And where did he get that massive hole in his head? These and other questions are worth overlooking. Watch this movie!"
2,An excellent must-see,"In this powerfully wonderful action film, severeal men look for a treasure and unearth a horrible master of complete cursed destruction, an all-powerful all-deadly mummy who was mummified alive and cursed. He rains on plague after another plague on Egypt.No one knows how to destroy this monster. He tries to reincarnate Anck-su-namun, his fomer love. The film has violent action,powerful mummies, and a scantily clad woman to enjoy looking at. The film is wonderful ... and action-packed for 125 minutes of power and suspense. The only flaw was Beni, the stupid character. An absolute must-see for the whole family"
2,"Not ""Great"" but a ""Good"" one!","All right - I admit, the movie is good: Good jokes, good action, good sound, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G special effects, a little bit of frightning here, a little bit of frightning there.. Well, ok, so what this a ""4 star movie"" and not ""5 star""? It's resemblance to Indiana Jones! I know it's a totaly different story and all, but I can't help it - It's just too similar in the music, the places shown and the characters.."
2,The Mummy,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was not going to be good. Like who wants to see a mummy chase people. But till I saw the whole move it was great. It was filled with action pack adventure and laughter. The Mummy was about a group of people searching for a long-lost treasure but unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy. Now it is going after them since they broke the curse.Do they have time to destroy the mummy before the world comes to an end. This is a good action epic, visual effect, and great story telling. With great actors like Brendan Fraiser, Rachel Weisz,John Hannan,Jonathon Hyde,Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo. This is a great movie to see."
1,Terrible movie. Don't waste your time or money.,"After viewing for about 10 minutes, I noticed a disagreeable odor being emitted from the disc. It wasn't the disc, it was that stupid movie. If this is what passes for entertainment now days, we are in worse shape than I imagined."
1,no no no no NO!!,"This movie sucks big time, although the special effects were OK. ILM could of done alot better. PLEASE STAY WELL CLEAR OF THIS FILM!! Would the producers of this film please promise us that they won't make a sequel. ILM please don't work with these films. Their ruining your reputation."
1,The special fx were sub-par and that was the best part!,"Avoid this film at all costs! The special effects, the film's only redeeming feature, are sub-par because they are used in a hideously predictable way. A horror film that doesn't scare at all. Actors who are best suited for roles in the adult film industry and a script which was evidently buried in the desert and never found. Who the hell green-lighted this effects-laden dungheap? I've wasted my money on other film like Deep Impact and Conspiracy Theory, but this film was a waste of my time! I could have spent those 125 minutes doing something else. Maximum Overdrive, the Emilio Estevez tour de force, was at least brainless fun. This film is just brainless. Do Hollywood a favor and buy or rent some pornography or Faces of Death instead of this cinematic black hole. Don't give them your money! (I saw this film for free and it still drained me of my valuable time. Don't waste your life, don't buy or rent this film!)"
2,A vastly amusing movie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. While it lacks the lovely atmospheric creepiness of the 1932 film it claims to be a remake of, it has a good-natured sense of adventure and is well cast. In truth it seems to be more of a remake in the style of Hammer Studio's Mummy films, but thankfully does not include the title character lurching around shedding bandages everywhere. Considering the stomach-dropping, heart-sickening disappointment the other big ""horror"" remake,""The Haunting,"" from the summer this film came out, and despite the occasional plot-hole (but let's face it, this film wasn't intended to be a ground-breaking, truth-shattering film, it was meant to be entertainment), ""The Mummy"" did not deserve the poor reviews it got from the critics."
1,super predictable rubbish,"The original is much better, at least in terms of including a few unexpected twists and turns. If you want to know what is going to happen next in this cgi ""masterpiece"", just apply the following formula ... what new element has just been introduced to the picture? how might it suddenly spring to life and kill someone? The scene with the scarab beetle being picked off the wall is a good example.BORING!!!!"
1,Belongs on MST3K,"This was possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Very few films manage to get everything wrong, but this one did. Expect a weak plot and a poor computer generated setting laced with general inaccuracies. There are a few moments of good acting with some characters, but they are canceled out by the horrible 'acting' of characters such as the mummy, which stares at a character for ten seconds, then growls."
2,Great Special Effects With Humor Throughout,I thought that this movie was great. I love Brendan Frasier's acting ability and I can always expect to laugh when I am watching a film he is in. I felt that the story line could have moved a little faster at the beginning with a little less violence but all and all a fun movie to watch.
1,I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy or a horror,"Visual effects aside, this movie was really quite dumb. My eleven year old twins enjoyed it and that was about the intellectual level the film. It seemed like Brendan Frazier wasn't quite sure if the film should be a comedy or a horror show. It seemed as though he wasn't quite sure how to act, funny or scared. It was quite violent at times and too many people died. I would not rent it again. If it wasn't for the visual effects--I would have rated the film 1 star."
2,Rachel Wiesz is incredible!,"I loved this movie, and that surprised me, because my tastes tend toward Bogart movies, or Gregory Peck or Audrey Hepburn. But this movie is wonderful! one minute you're scared out of your mind, and the next you are laughing. Not many movies can pull that off. Frasier is also solid (in my opinion) in his role. OK, so he's not Bogart, but still convincing in his charactar. Rachel Wiesz is nothing short of amazing! Of course, those big brown eyes do help! I think she has to be the most stunningly beautiful actress around. ""The Mummy"" is no classic, but its still worth the money for one wild ride!"
2,This film is not bad!,"Well, I loved the Indiana Jones movies and [guess what!] I love this one as well!The special effects are really good and many of the scenes are hilarious.However, I've only seen this film once, so I'm not sure if it starts to get boring once you've seen it a few more times."
2,A Thoroughly Satisfying Adventure Movie,"The Mummy is high quality entertainment. It does a great job of entertaining, that's saying something. Some movies can't even do that. But this succeeds on all levels.It's a great popcorn flick. And it's packed to the brim with action.The DVD features a commentary from the director Stephen Sommers, deleted scenes, a few making of featurettes, and a bevy of other special features including trailers and a music only track.If you're a fan of action, definitely recommended."
2,Hahahahahahahahahaha,"I loved this movie and this keyboard I'm typing on is kind of whacky so any mistakes are probably not my fault.Back to the movie: it was a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser kept me laughing. The characters were pretty well drawn. And all the expendables were somehow still endearing. John Hannah was standout. Very funny guy. ""Bad luck, old mum,"" and ""Im-ho-tep,"" were probably the funniest lines in the whole movie. The special effects were stunning and the action was pulse pounding.A couple of quibbles with minor spoilers: if the beetles ate Imhotep, ""very slowly,"" in the words of the female lead, then how come they devoured that poor guy in the passageway in like .5 seconds? And how come the Imhotep took the eyes of Burns, who wore glasses? I expected to see the mummy staggering around like Burns did when his glasses wer knocked off.Any way very good. Little language and the violence isn't bloody or too gruesome with the possible exception of the burrowing bugs."
2,better than the 1932 classic,the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the 1990's. the mummy packs a wallop!
2,Mummy...the ultimate movie!,"I really loved this movie, i remember seeing it the next day after star wars come out and loving the fact it is a new Indiana jones type movie, sure there has been many tries at those type but this movie is dead on, only missing doctor jones. The movie is not scary but a load of fun and a good adventure. if you have the regular dvd then skip this and save your money as it's not enough extras to make it worth it the mummy returns is out on dvd soon so the spotlight on it here is not worth it.but if you don't have the mummy yet on dvd then get this one since it's both widescreen and fullscreen and the extras are nice."
1,Another worthless Remake,"Hollywood must think that fans of Horrormovies are Braindead,otherwise they would have choosen to use either the version proposed by Clive Barker or Joe Dante for the Remake of ""The Mummy""Instead a mediocre script was choosen,and a less then mediocre actor,Brendan Fraser(George of the Jungle) was hired for the lead role and to top it all of,very bad CGI(Cheap Gimmicky Images? )where used in this worthless Remake! But I guess that's all that is needed to have a Summer Blockbuster?"
1,very disappointing,"Having grown the love the Richard Jury mysteries, I was bitterly disappointed by this novel. I tried to wade through it but it was so gawd-awful boring that I just gave up."
1,Not worth the cost.,"Bought 2 shirts $29.99 did not really think this through for the shipping charges $20 per shirt, 2 shirts came in one box(size of a medium pizza box).The company did offer to take the shipment back but, it was too late, I opened the shirts. After 2 washes, they are not holding up too well, so overall. I would not endorse this company or product.Amazon though, did acknowledge my issue with this shipping transaction as best they could. I hope they will improve for the next buyer."
1,Huge disappointment,"I've played all of the CSI games and the three L&O games prior to this one and, man, was I let down by this. It's a huge resource hog - it took almost 10 minutes to install the thing and it took even longer to uninstall it. When the installation is complete it automatically sends a registration (to whom and with what information is unknown - a major privacy violation) without giving the opportunity to say no. The game play isn't intuitive at all and doesn't follow the same conventions established in the earlier offerings. The PDA thing is a pain in the [...], there's no right-click functionality, limited options in terms of configuration (cannot play it in other than full screen), and NO INSTRUCTIONS! Not happy at all with this."
1,Poor quality,After first time worn it turned color. It is too thick and cumbersome to wear as a toe ring. Very poor deign.
1,cheap n nasty,"gold colour came off within 3 days, then silver colour in a couple more days which then left the copper. this then turned finger black all within a week.New Spiral Twister Magnetic Band Fits Ring Size 7 & up"
1,"THESE ARE KNOCK OFFS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE","I BUY THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND ABOUT ONCE A MONTH. WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEFORE. I SEARCHED AND FOUND SOME THAT WERE CHEAPER ON AMAZON THOUGH A WHOLESALER, ALL THE TIME WHOLESALE. THEY WERE 17.99+4.59 SHIPPING. HE GOT THEM A WEEK LATER. THE FIST TIME HE USED THEM HE HAD CUTS ALL OVER HIS FACE, HE STILL HAD SHORT HAIRS THAT HAD NOT BEEN SHAVED OFF AS THE BLADE WAS VERY DULL, AND HIS FACE WAS BURNING. ON THE BACK OF THE BLADE THE ORANGE STRIP HAD BEEN WORN OFF JUST FROM ONE SHAVE. THESE ARE DEFINATLY KNOCK OFFS. WE COMPARED THEM FROM ONES WE ORDERED BEFORE AND THEY DO NOT LOOK THE SAME. I USED ONE OF THE BLADES TO SEE IF MY HUSBAND WAS RIGHT, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. I GOT RASOR BURN AND STILL HAD LITTLE HAIRS THAT WERE NOT REMOVED AS THE BLADE WAS SO DULL. WE WILL NEVER PURCHASE BLADES FROM ALL THE TIME WHOLE SALE AGAIN, OR EVEN AMAZON IF THEY CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM ."
1,Pretty sure they are not authentic!,"I am currently talking to the people over at Gillette over the concern that this product listed on Amazon may be counterfeit. The razors are not shaving smoothly, they are very very rough and tear up my face. Now when I have purchased this same product from places like cvs, walmart and target; they shave so smoothly and gently. Also the packaging looks off. I will not be buying again from Amazon if they are allowing counterfeit goods on their site."
2,Great!,This item came to me in a timely manner and there was absolutely nothing wrong with this product.
2,La mejor afeitadora del momento,"Yo llevo casi 2 años afeitandome con la Fusion Power y afirmo que es la mejor afeitadora del mundo. Yo uso cada cartucho 5 veces, y afeitan bien hasta el ultimo uso."
1,This review is for the R-Rated version,"Wicked Sister is an interesting movie starring two half sisters Chelsea and Misty Mundae. Misty plays the bad sister who gets her good sister Chelsea into some bad trouble at school and now they're on the lam. Along the way the meet a crazy woman who wants to play a game with the two. An entertaining movie that is hampered by heavy editing.It's okay, but get the unrated one instead."
1,Bordering on incoherent,"As a grdauate student, I feel compelled to write honestly about this book in the hopes that what I'm writing might influence some teacher's decision in the future. Granted, the topic area this book is covering isn't trivial, but in the light of its complex nature it is even more paramount that someone attempting to explain it to those who don't understand it be well-versed in, frankly, English. This book is quite possibly the worst textbook I have ever encountered. The writing is atrocious, the ""flow"" is like mud, and the explanations make even things that could be simple, dreadfully complex. Avoid it like the plague, there are a lot better options."
2,Infant Fun,"My son is 14 weeks old. He started playing with this toy at about 13 weeks. So far he is in heaven with this toy. When I lay him on the floor to play he loves to bat at the toy to activate it. He loves the lights, and music, and looking at the fish. It is really neat to see him start to learn that if he moves his arm and hits the bowl it will start up again. It is very entertaining for him. I wish there were more toys like this for my infant. Since he can't sit up yet it is really hard to find stuff to occupy him and this is a definate hit with him. When I put him on his stomach it encourages him to lift his head up so he can look at the lights in the bowl. I love this toy!"
2,great toy,"my son loved it when he was little, and now my other son is playing with he and he seems to love it too!"
1,too many negatives,"I just got this toy for my six month old daughter and I cannot recommend it. Here is why:The batteries don't last at all (empty after ten days)It is way too heavy, my daughter can already pick it up and if she drops it on her head it will really hurt her.The lights and music come on by the slightest touch or vibration, she does not have to do anything to help her learn (like putting the balls in the middle) - just me walking by will make it come on."
1,Don't Know Yet,"My daughter is 6 1/2 months old. She's been sitting up for at least 2 weeks. She laughs at this toy when I activate the music. She picks up the balls if I hand them to her. Otherwise, she is NOT interested. Things may change.....but so far, I like this more than she does."
2,Fantastic addition for any road warrior,"I run my own insurance business and was always inundated by a sea of paperwork. This little scanner fits into my BJC-85 printer and serves double duty - I can scan and then print with the same machine. Genius! I would have liked the ability to scan documents into a pdf format, but you can't have everything. This little scanner is the main reason I will not upgrade my BJC-85, as it is not compatible with later models."
1,I have had more fun with a bag of sharp glass.,The creators of this game wasted great graphics on a game with not enough depth. The only time I had fun playing this is when I paused it and took a nap and had a dream about Pamela Anderson. There weren't any guns and the game was way to hard.
2,Worth it,"My daughter got this toy last Christmas when she was 2. She liked it, but wasn't totally enthused. Now at 3, she is more into it & we tried another cartridge (Science- Living Things). I am a middle school science teacher & I was really impressed with this cartridge! My son is 15 mos & he also really loves Kasey, but I have to cover the on/off button & play with him. My daugher is able to play with Kasey independently. The only thing that I really don't like about the toy is the screen - it really needs its own light source. It is too dark & hard to see sometimes, esp. if you aren't right in front of it in a bright room. This is tough when you are playing with a child who may a need a little help - it is hard for you both to see. Kasey the Kinderbot is really cute & teaches a lot. It is very different from the Leap Pad type toys, so it is still worth getting even if you have one of those already."
2,Best toy I ever purchased,"Kasey the Kinderbot is truly the best toy I ever purchased! I have a 3 year old girl and an 8 year old boy and both love it. It really does make learning fun for both of them. Both have used it constantly. Luckily, my son is gone to school all day.I had the 2XL Robot as a kid and this is basically the same thing but even better. Better get yours sooner rather than later. This toy will most likely be the HOT toy for this Christmas season."
2,My 3 year old LOVES his KASEY!!!!,"And so do I. It has a volume control on it to boot!This is the PERFECT educational toy to hold my little mans attention while I get some housework done. He EVEN knows how to change the learning functions on the back. He LOVES IT and will probably love it for a long time more....when he outgrows it, it will go to his baby brother or sister who is on the way."
1,But is it accurate?,"Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4, definition of UTP; and, page 17, max segment length 10base2; these are the errors I caught with my limited knowledge; my faith in the accuracy of the book has been undermined. I find this frustrating because I was looking forward to reading this book; I am now afraid to commit to memory anything I read within it."
2,Lovely Ring,"I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so, I guessed at the size. Boy, was I way off! The shop took it back and sent another with no problems. My daughter loves it!"
1,Much Too Expensive,"I bought the Fusion manual razor and after using the two included cartridges and then seeing the cost of replacement cartridges, I have tossed my Fusion. Replacement Fusion cartridges are much too expensive and the shave one gets from them simply does not justify this kind of expense. I think the pricing of Fusion cartridges is like that of gasoline: we are being milked of every cent we are willing to part with.Another issue I'm concerned about is that the clamshell packaging is dangerous if it is anything like the packaging used for Mach 3 cartridges. The plastic of the packaging will stab or slice you. It is unsafe for most adults. The government ought to force Gillette to design safer packaging.The main reason for giving this product 1 star is the price. I'm not willing to part with $22 to $28 for 8 shaving cartridges."
1,Getting burned,"I tried this but it was not working out for me, and had lot of issues. I was getting cuts and burns. The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed. No burns/cuts with Proglide power. (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count"
2,"Great price, but still expensive!","While this is the most affordable option for this item I found, it is still quite expensive. Glad to find them here."
2,Razors,Fast and good service. I really appreciate your efforts. Too bad we have to use so many words to put in our review!
1,These are not real Gillette blades!,"These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens. Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream. They are just plain fakes. I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time. They are just plain fake!"
1,Seems like knock-offs,not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade... these will give you cuts and burn.. will not buy again
1,Doing bad business,The product did not show up on time. I tried to email the seller but they never got back to me. I still have no idea if they are going to give me the product. It is just bad business and I am shopping elsewhere.
2,Great for everyday shaving needs,"I am quite picky about my razor blades, since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily. The Fusion has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade."
1,Knock-offs!,These are knock-offs. They HURT! The blades aren't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges.
2,Great deal,These are the same razors you purchase at the store- but for a third less. Even beats costco's pricing. Great deal
1,Knockoff,"Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive, once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff. In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller, this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out. I would never buy from this seller again."
2,high society,"This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy."
1,OK but not great,"It's a fairly readable book, but there are quite a few errors.The book is strongly based on the open-the-loop method to find loaded Q, but this method is heavily flawed due to the impedances where the loop is broken being not known."
1,Technical book purchase review.,"High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR, Rocks, OpenMosix, and MPI (Nutshell Handbooks)The main issue I found is that the purchase was mislead. I was trying to buy a hard copy and they gave me a kindle copy instead without warning!"
2,What Makes The Perfect Balaclava?,"What makes the perfect balaclava?Ideally it should be elastic, silky smooth, durable and help draw sweat away from your head.Most balaclavas nowadays are made of nylon/acrylic & spandex. Why? It is elastic and remains that way after many uses. Cotton balaclavas will stretch over time and will not retain their elasticity. Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can ""ball up"" creating those annoying lint balls. The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon/acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk. They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material."
1,"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this book...","Although I appreciate the amount of effort required to write a book, I simply can not recommend this one. The book describes unimportant or familiar concepts (like the traditional relational model) in too much detail and new or important concepts (like the Oracle8 object extension syntax) in not enough detail. Many of the diagrams do not appear to relate to the topics being discussed and the examples are too few and far between. I felt that the author used terminology inconsistently or at the very least did not define terms adequately. One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle `syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try ""Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling"" by Dorsey et. al."
1,as ugly as it gets,"UFC 43 is a joke of an event. There is only one good fight which is the main event. The rest of the card is saved for no namers or fat has-beens such as Kimo and Tank. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind."
2,Great for Pilates Classes,I just bought this and used it in my Pilates class for the first time today. My students loved it and I loved it too. It is even great for easy listening while cleaning your house or enjoying a nice afternoon relaxation.
2,My favorite Metheny CD,"I listened to this cassette quite a bit back in 1985 and then left it for quite a while. Last year (2003), I was amazed to find myself humming ""Yolanda, You Learn"" and ordered the CD from Amazon. Discovering this music all over again was a joy. To me, this is a CD of uplifting, joyous music made by fantastic musicians offering up some incredible performances.While I have listened to other Metheny releases, nothing has touched me like this one. I would loved to have given this five stars, but the decision to include ""Forward March"" was a mistake. Fortunately, modern CD players can be programmed to skip tracks. My favorite tracks are ""Yolanda, You Learn,"" ""The First Circle,"" and ""Praise."" ""If I Could"" is so beautiful in its simplicity as to bring you to goosebumps and tears.If you are a guitarist or lover of Brazilian music, this CD is a must-have. This release is totally accessible to all lovers of quality music. Highly recommended."
2,Better than first impression!,"The MonsterGecko FPS mouse it much better than it looks. Trust me. Even I looked at it at first and thought it was a waste of time. But when I saw it for a great black Friday deal, I picked it up because I was curious. Now I can safely say it's well worth the purchase. The mouse has a good resolution, and the shame is more than a gimmick. It really does feel great to use, games or not! I recommend this product by far!"
1,"Pass: Novelty item, not real usable","Though very well built, and fun to hold, it's not usable if you're already good at first-person shooters using a mouse -well, not without some serious retraining of your hand and wrist. Especially games heavy on right-click, like Unreal Tournament. It's basically a mouse, only bulkier and less comfortable for extended play."
1,Pointless,If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.
2,VERY GOOD!,"I bought this item from davewemall recently and it came very quickly. They provided good service and when I got the item, it was exactly the item I wanted. Thanks davewebmall!"
1,Pretty but flimsy,"This is a very attractive feeder, but the problems I have will keep me from buying another.The slide-clip opens with very little pressure - the squirrels pop it open every third or fourth landing.The wire hanger is close to breaking near the slide-clip.The slide-clip is a marvelous idea, but the application is weak.It is very simple to clean. The side panels lift out so they can be thoroughly scrubbed, and once they are out, the inside of the feeder is easily accessible."
1,"Nice looking, but sloppy feeder","At first, I was quite pleased with the feeder. It looks nice and the birds (although restricted to small birds) frequented this feeder often, to the point where I was going through bird seed fairly quickly. However, when I took a closer look, I found most of the bird feed on the ground. When I started watching the birds very closely, I would estimate that for every seed the bird took from the feeder, 3 or 4 seeds would fall to the ground. The feeding holes are fairly large and I expect this contributes to the seed falling out."
2,Value Feeder,"Overall a very good item. Holds plenty of seed, however just as others, much of the seed falls to the ground as the birds are feeding. The only good thing there is that once the feeder's empty, the birds fly down to clean up the rest."
2,Topeak Exployer Bike Rack with Spring,It was beyond my expectations. Its a sturdy well constructed rack.The spring on the rack works great! Combine withn the bike bag I purchased its all I need for my cycling experience.
2,Great rack for bigger bikes,"After ordering two racks that would not mount properly, I ended up getting this one. My 25"" Trek is a huge bike and no other racks would mount at the right angle. This one however, fits like a glove.High quality build, very sturdy and solid. Lots of adjust ability so it'll fit everything from my wifes 17.5"" frame to my 25""."
2,Functional tent,"Hey, it is what it is---a tent for the outdoors. I got this for my three month old son who likes to sit outside. My two cats like it, too, and sit in there with him. There is plenty of space for all three."
1,UV rating?,"Contrary to the Amazon description, this play tent does not offer any UV protection. Nowhere on the packaging does it mention SPF or UV protection. Misleading and disappointing."
2,Great play tent fits in very small bag,"I bought this tent to take to the beach for my 8 month old. The bag it comes in is so small that I thought, at first, that the tent may be too small for my baby. The tent is a great size for an 8 month old and even a little larger. It's very durable and is great for the beach, except that, when your baby isn't in it, you need to put something in it to keep it from blowing away. The assembly was very easy for my husband who has assemble tents before, but I found it a bit more difficult. I would recommend that you face the solid purple tent side in the direction of the sun as the shear sides don't provide shade. The first day we used it on the beach, I ended up draping our beach towels over the side to shield my napping baby from the sun. Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase of this tent. I think it is value priced, and it fits back into its very small back with ease."
1,"Boring, not very educational","My daughter has been playing with the Fisher Price Grand Piano which is by far better than this piano. Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.This particular Rock and Roll Piano doesn't light up, plays different types of musical instruments, but the keys aren't as fun to play. My daughter played it a few times and went straight back to the Grand Piano. Consider buying that one instead."
1,heinous,"This is the most terrible, emotionally offensive film ever created. After watching this movie, my eyes began to bulge from my head and limbs began to fall off. Watch this movie if you like the feeling of having your organs ruptured."
1,Horrendous,"Anybody that would sit through something so stupid like this movie should be shot. I was not one of the other losers I have what they called taste in movies in this day and age and this is just flat out retarted. Its also a shame i have to give this movie 1 star it makes me feel as though i support this shi* in a way. I just wonder if the acting in it could be half as bad as the movie or the plotI wouldnt watch this if i was paid, Wake up America and today's youth"
2,Wonderful read aloud book!,"I read this book to my 11 year old son. Both of us were captivated with Roald Dahl's experiences prior to and during World War II.Though our family has thoroughly enjoyed all of Dahl's fiction, this is the first non-fiction Dahl book we have read. The way he describes the people, places and machinery he encounters is so real and honest. He comes across as an astute observer during the times he describes. I found this book to be entertaining and educational. I only wish he had written more books about the next decades of his life."
1,Dead or didn't work,"I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it... and it completely failed to work! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards (which I was using) and this PS. Supposedly I had a ""fixed"" unit though, but it failed to work. Going back to the old PS (an Antec SmartPower) worked without a problem."
1,Not a good fit,The tent seems to be good. But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent. Just comes off too easily when the kids try to crawl through it. Would find a better tent tunnel combination that holds up strong.
1,too narrow,I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times. Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow! What happened?
2,Best I've Used,"I was pleasantly surprised. This is really the best razor I have ever used. I just assumed that having 4 blades was just another gimmick, but it really provides an amazingly smooth and clean shave and minimizes nicks and cuts."
2,Good value for a great product,My older black retreiver has flaky and peeling skin. She had a thyroid condition and we use this shampoo. It really soothes and seems to help.
2,Jewelry clean solution,Use in my ultrasonic unit and makes everything look brand new. I recommend you heat solution in microwave before adding to unit to boost cleaning power on grease/lotion which sticks to prongs.
2,Great read,"Overall, easy transaction. The book is very touchy on provoking emotions from the reader. The published stories in the book are very eyeopening and realistic. Sender made the transaction easy to work with."
1,Usual Glacial Paced Novel from James,"This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you."
1,I love classics. I'll never read Henry James again.,"It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting, but his writing here flows like a gutter clogged with leaves, only occasionally achieving the fluidity I look for in fine writing. I chose it because it was shorter than some of the more famous ones. Life is too short. I'll sell it back."
1,not durable,"Several of these came with my crossbow so I used them to sight in and bought Gold Tip brand bolts for hunting. They're a bit brittle/ fragile as compared to the Gold Tip bolts. They were destroyed by target shooting, some had the inserts pull out and left the insert and broadhead inside my target and others snapped off when I pulled them out. It seemed to me like just the force of hitting the layered target was enough to crack the arrow or break the glue loose and they finished breaking when I tried to pull them out."
1,warning about motorola phones,"The product has a USB port but it is not compatible with my Motorola phone, the phone says unauthorized power supply and disconnects.Works with ipods but I think the Motorola expects a ""smart"" usb port it can talk to and this must not be one."
2,Amazing product,"This is a cool product, so far I don't have any problems with this. It charges my Iphone, and any other small units. I haven't tried this in a long drive yet but I'll give you guys an update when I drive from NY to TX this summer. Well, so far so good!Cons: The only thing I notice is that you can't really tell if it's ""on"" since the ""ON"" button's light is unnoticeable, it is just useless unless you try to wrap your hands around it to dim the area. BUt I still would recommend it to anyone I know!"
2,In agreement with others,"I would have to echo the sentiments of many of the other reviews. I bought this when my 11 month old son started pushing everything he could around the living room. He loves it but it is way too fast for his little legs. Also, it moves around when he is just trying to play with the balls and net because you can't stabilize it. Plus when the balls disappear he gets very disappointed.It's definitely going to help his walking but it's a constant supervision toy."
1,It sucks!,"My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together, we helped our daughter hold on to the handle and it flew out from under her like a bullet!She would sometimes crawl behind it and push it. But, she got bored with that. Now that she has started walking she doesn't pay any attention to it. We fixed it where she can sit on it and push herself along, but her legs are too short. She threw balls into the basket a couple of times, but she has another toy that she can throw balls in that she likes a lot better.Also, the annoying music comes on so easily. All you have to do is walk near it and it goes off.We're getting her something different soon."
2,My 3 year old still plays with this,"My 3 year old loves this toy. It's now an outside toy, but she has consistently played with it since day one. She learned to push with it (watch out for wood floors, it tends to go fast). She loved the balls and the sounds as well. Now it's a ride on toy that she's a little tall for, but she still scoots around on it.We left it outside and that ruined the sound, but for us it was a good thing. ;)"
1,Not Safe,"I've never written a review on an item, but I will on this one. My daughter is about 1 year old and this product is not very good for a baby learning to walk. As soon as she pushed it into a wall and leaned forward the whole thing almost flipped over. Could have caused a serious injury had I not been right there. I don't see how it has such a high rating by other users."
1,Horrible toy...,"My daughter received this toy when she was about 11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the ""v"" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy."
1,Not Useful as a Walker for all Children,My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
2,cute and durable,this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.
2,Gamma Good,Gamma's high rise gold 75 is the best ball hopper I've ever owned. I've been playing tennis for over 20 years. Gamma good!
2,Funny Horror!,Another one of those humorous horror movies that you liked as a kid. It's Creature Feature on a sleigh ride. Fun.
2,Fun!!,"I bought this tunnel for my daughter for her first birthday, and she has loved it ever since! She has so much fun crawling through the tunnel and hiding in there. It is a great chance for any child to get exercise and to add some fun and excitement to their day!"
2,great toy,"I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel, and she just loves it. They didn't have that one at our local [store], so we bought the 6' Find-Me Play Tunnel. I think this tunnel will last a long time. My kids have already jumped on top of it, and the dog even tried to crawl through. It seems to be quite durable and is not made of cheap plastic like some of the less expensive tunnels. It's definitely worth the extra money."
2,Excellent Lens!,"I don't have much to say that hasn't been said before. This is the sharpest lens I own and it has become my ""gold standard"". The image quality of all of my other lenses get compared to this one.This is also the first lens that I have owned which has exceeded the capabilities of my camera. As I zoom in, my other lenses would lose sharpness before the image would pixelate. With this lens, I was sharp down to the pixel level. This inspired me to upgrade from a 6MP K100DS to a 12MP K-r.The images from this lens are extremely lifelike and the colors are superb. I get more ""keepers"" using the DA 40mm than with any other lens."
1,Disappointing,"I think had this book been labelled ""romantic erotica"" instead of romance, I would have been less disappointed with the story. Because having the characters say 'I love you' a lot doesn't make it a romance (especially when they've known each other for all of a day)! Both Connor and Adam felt very 'flat' to me- there wasn't anything to differentiate them from the surrounding characters, and the surrounding characters weren't painted all that vividly either. It's hard to get into a story like this when you don't care what happens to the characters. The heavy-handed exposition and info dumping was also quite irritating, as was the fetishization of aboriginal people."
2,Rutger Hauer Exemplified,"Loved it, typically audacious atrocious and ribald. What's not to like about castles, bows & arrows and mid evil...evil complete with rape, pilliage and plunder; and torture and gore!"
1,AWFUL,Just horrible. Good looking guys but that does not make make up for the long periods of boredom.One of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
2,Present for a friend,"A friend of mine is a cake decorator and is always looking for new styles and ways to make her creations. I bought this for her birthday and she loved it. She was excited to get a book from Debbie Brown, which she said was the best cake decorator she knew about. So a really big smile on her face was enough for me to realize that I got a good present."
1,doncha think,that this song is better promoted for itself rather than on the strength of PR trickery trying to capitalize on all things web-based?it's a cynical marketing world that tries to sell us its corporate soap wrapped up with a hippy or a punk bow
1,DO NOT BUY IF IT'S SOLD AND SHIPPED BY AMAZON.COM,"Amazon sent me a BOOTLEG copy of this album. There was a SCANNED picture as an insert and the cd was a CD-R. There was no back to this case at all.!! They are selling it for full retail price, and sending out bootlegs. Amazon refused to help and told me they will investigate why they are bootleg but that is it..really?? They refused me of a refund as well! Disgusting!"
1,Nice thought but too weak,"in the age of the overblown Rod Stewart&Clay Aikens trying to Romance a Era gone by with very Sub-Par Results add another victim to the list.Mandy Moore.now Mandy Moore Vocally is closer to Jessica Simpson,&Christina,Monica,Beyonce,but Mandy's material is Lite in the Booty.Her Material ain't no threat to Vocal Light Weights like Brittney,J-Lo,Ashanti&Others.the concept of Her doing this&at Her Age being aware of the Past because lets be real:Most Peeps coming along today are pushed by the Media&other sources as thinking that Old School is Last Summer&this is Offically the Fall now.Mandy doesn't have enough juice to make Her take on these Songs Believable fully.now in any 20 years She might be a bit more Seasoned&She might find that Connie Francis Element She has in Her.stay tunned."
1,Could have been........,"With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy, was I dissappointed!There are twelve cuts on this cd, everything from Joan Armatrading to Blondie. Clearly the best cut here is a wonderful cover of John Hiatt's ""Have a Little Faith in Me"". After that, Carly Simon's ""Anticipation"" and E.John's ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" round out all that is worthy of mention on this cd. Skip everything else. Besides a poor selection of songs and an even poorer performance, there is a feeling of being rushed through the music presented here. This just destroys any connection with the songs. A little less pace would have given more of a feel for the songs here. The quintiessential cover cd of the year is Michael McDonald's ""Motown"", this could have been in that league. But it isn't, skip it and wait for the next effort."
1,Not great,"I agree with an earlier review in that the first three songs are not good and they sound the same. The rest is okay but not great. She definitely has a very good voice and could probably come out with an amazing cd someday, but this is not it. Some of the covers were pleasant to listen to but not one of them touched anywhere near the realm of the original singer's version. I would wait and buy a used copy if you're thinking of buying it."
1,Disappointing....,"I've been a fan of Mandy Moore from the beginning, but that was way back in 2000. I was hoping that she would have evolved a little bit more being that it is 2007. This cd was not entirely a waste of money, but there were only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to more than once."
2,Yey!,"Ummmm You don't have to be an adult to like these songs. In fact that was what I was afraid of when many posted the clips of her new songs on her website. They sounded old... But listening to the whole song is a different story, they have jazzed up the songs a bit with some new souding stuf and it's Great!. Hard Core Mandy Fans(like me) will love it! It's not the buggle gummy pop sound she had with her first album, nor is it the middle eastern kindo f sound from her last one, it's something new and it is awesome! She didn't write any of the songs, but she makes them her own. If you like mandy at all, then you should get this album!"
1,Sub Zero's worst role ever (LOGO) SMK,"How could Ed Boon do this to my favorite MK character Sub Zero. What a discrace to the MK series.Sucky graphics,sucky moves, and is very complicated.Trust me don't even try this game ever.If you would like to see more of my reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO)SMK"
2,Gets the job done.,"This drying rack gets the job done. Sometimes the plastic pieces at the end of the legs come off, but no biggie. You can just pop'em right back on.If you need a drying rack for 2 people (or maybe eve three) this is a good choice."
1,tough to read,The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book.
1,tedious run-on sentences; shallow characters,"I'm sure Saramago's Nobel Prize was not based on this work. Not one person in my book group was able to finish this book because of the tedious, run-on sentences (the first chapter is all one sentence), and characters too shallow to care about plodding further. The initial premise was interesting -- how one word could change the entire perspective of historical events -- but failed to deliver."
2,Great,Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.
1,Not Compatible with windows 7,"I gave one star because i could not play game.Im glad i only paid $6.95.Thair is a way to get the game to play on windows 7,you have to set you boot advanced options to 1 core every time you want to play game."
2,You go boy!,"I know it's mostly just covers, but that's what makes it good! Harlemm takes the classics and makes them his own. His voice is amazing and I just love listening to him. He may be short and bald, but he's adorable none the less. When are you going on tour?!?!?"
1,Hated It!!!!,I can't believe how bad this sounds. There are a lot better singers that are just starting out. I wouldn't recommend this cd!
2,"Baby loves it, so do I!",This is a wonderful item. My son loves to try and catch the fish as they are moving around. The music and sounds will lull him to sleep in no time at all.
1,Too Loud,"I recently had to replace my Peaceful Planet Aquarium with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. I am not pleased with the Ocean Wonders, it is obnoxiously loud, there is nothing ""peaceful"" or ""aquatic"" about the aquarium. Needless to say I am returning the Ocean Wonders and purchasing another Peaceful Planet off of Ebay."
1,Not my son's favorite,"My friends recommended this product, but we had a bad experience with it. First of all, the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep. Second, and the most painful, once my son learned to roll over and scoot around, he kept hitting the bottom of the toy with his head and needless to say was getting really upset about it. We kept it in his crib for about 3 weeks and now it's stored in the closet. It was not the best investment for us."
1,WILL NEVER PURCHASE USED AGAIN,"I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one, and the seller 100% GUARANTEED my satisfaction! BULL! Seller claimed that all toys were tested prior to shipping, guess they forgot this one?? The entire right side has no working bubbles, the big fish in the middle does not move at all. Seller also claimed there were no scratches or marks, yet theres a scratch on the bottom, and what looks like yellow and pink marker on it. I am so disappointed its unreal!!!"
2,Works wonders when putting your child to sleep!,"The Ocean Wonders Aquarium was one of the last items I registered for but is by far, one of the best presents we have received for our newborn son. My husband and I used it from the first day our son was born and at two months of age, he still falls asleep to this music. For a newborn, the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is much better then any mobile as kids do not follow the moving objects until they are at least couple of weeks old but they do respond to sounds. The music is very soothing and will calm a crying baby in minutes. The downside - 15 mins of playing might not be enough so pressing the play button several times can be a pain expecially at night if you have a separate baby room. A remote control would be a great improvement."
1,"boring and stupid, get a mobile","this toy is another attempt by toymakers to teach infants to be content alone in their cribs. anyone who still buys into the idea that babies will and should fall asleep alone should get a full grown dog, not have a baby. this toy is so pathetic that it can only grasp for the attention of a very young babies, my four month old was bored with it immediately. do yourself and your baby a favor. rock, nurse and sing your baby to sleep yourself. if you want a crib toy get your baby a mobile or 2. they are much more interesting for the baby."
2,Won't Travel Without It,"Our son is 8 months old and we've been using the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in his crib since he was about 2 or 3 months old. He has grown to expect the same song every time he goes in for a nap or to bed for the night. There are three settings on it, one is just music, the next is music and lights (this is the setting we use), and the 3rd is music, lights, and bubbles(vibrations). Now when our son wakes in the middle of the night, he reaches up and turns his music on himself and puts himself back to sleep! When we are away from home and we bring the aquarium, it gives him a touch of home and soothes him to sleep. I recommend it often to my friends who are expecting."
2,The best bedtime toy,"We first learned about this toy when our baby was in the hospital. We attached it to his crib and he loved it. He loved it so much that we went and got one for him. Whenever he is upset we just have to turn it on and he calms right down. It has different settings so they either have something to see, listen to or both. It is really great for a young baby.I do not think that any nursery should be without this toy."
2,Don't go home from the hospital without it!,This was the one thing that would soothe our son when we brought him home from the hospital. He is 3 months old now and sleeping through the night. When he wakes up he starts to kick and swing his arms and he accidentally turns the aquarium on. He falls right back to sleep! The aquarium will only stay on for 5 minutes. This was not long enough when he was a newborn. I would have to stay in the room for 5 minutes to turn it back on. He likes the ocean sounds better than the music and the louder the better.
1,has no water after being in the closet for 2 years.,My 3 year old son played with this all the time till he got to be a year old then i put it in the closet for a while till i had my 2nd son and just toke it out and now it has no water inside and the fish dont move either. Is there some where i can take it to get a replacement?
2,Perfect for Bed Time!!!,"The best thing about this crib toy is the volume control. My 3-month old is content to lay there by herself just looking at the lights (only at night time though). Great for when she is semi-sleepy, following the lights knocks her out."
2,This makes your bedtime routine easy!,"I have used this aquarium in my daughter's crib since she was two months old. She is now 10 months and still loves it! More importantly, when we lay her down and press it on, the music signals to her that it is time for bed. She willingly rolls over to look at it and eventually falls asleep. She used to press it on herself in the middle of the night to go back to sleep(when her crib was lower and the aquarium was more accessible). I would reccommend this soothing toy to anyone and suggest to start using it early on. The only modifications I would make would be a remote control for parents to turn it on without entering the room(it only goes for 7 minutes) and maybe longer straps so that when the crib is lowered the baby can still reach it."
2,Great Entertainment,"We bought this for my 2 month old daughter because she loves my parents fish tank. At first she wasn't all that intested in it, but now she loves it. At 4 months she turns it on all by herself with her feet. It has several different music/sounds to choose from. It was well worth the investment."
1,who picked the music...???,"we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son, but some of the moving parts had frozen over time in storage, so we decided to replace it since he loved it so much. that version had happy, cheerful nursery songs. the new version plays an almost eerie, creepy, surreal-type music that actually made my youngest son cry! it's a good thing the new model comes with a silent mode (bubble sounds) or we would've returned it.visually, the toy is mesmerizing and my son likes it as long as we don't play the music."
2,The music stops too soon!!!,"I cannot compare it to anything else since we bought it for our first child. She LOVES to watch the fish move and she tries to grab things. I put her in her crib when I am folding her clothes etc. The problem is that I am constantly running back and forth to turn the music back on!!! It ends too soon and that is what she loves! Other than that, we do like it, it keeps her entertained."
2,Put baby to sleep fast,"I got this when my son was four months old and he is now 14 months old and still uses it to go sleep. He loves to ""talk"" to the fish and every night. He loves to push the buttons all the time to make it go. When he was younger the music on this was the only thing that calmed him down. It is very durable as my two year has unhook it and it fell on the floor and it still works fine. I would recommend this to everyone,the money is well worh it, and I know he will be using this for several more years as he loves this still."
2,My daughter has loved it since she was a newborn,"I recieved this at my baby shower. My daughter has loved it since the day I brought her home from the hospital. She listens to it every night when she goes to bed. She would always smile when i would turn it on when she was just a few weeks old, even if she was sleeping. Now she is 9 months old and still loves it. It is easy fopr her to turn on and make the little star fish move. She will sit and pay with it for quite some time"
1,5 minutes??,I bought this item thinking that it would be a wonderful thing to have in my son's crib to help him fall asleep. It takes more than 5-10 minutes though for him to in fact fall asleep. So when it turns off he just starts to cry because he hasn't figured out how to turn it on again. Also just the fact that it has to be constantly turned on defeats the purpose because it just keeps my son awake. It's cute but there have been better sleep aids in the past that are not on the market any more.
2,get TWO!,"This was the BEST thing we got for a baby shower gift. The motor gave out after being played over and Over and OVER and **OVER** again every night for 5 years. He wanted a replacement one but we finally convinced him it was for babies and he was too grown up for it. As another reviewer said, it would be better if it played longer - our son would just be drifting off and it would shut off, then he would pop back awake & start it over again."
2,What would we do without it??!!,"This is the greatest thing!! We use it every night to put our 12 week old daughter to bed after her lullaby. She goes into her crib wide awake but this is so calming and soothing to her that 9 times out of 10 she falls asleep within 5 minutes. The variety of settings is great too - we use the bubbles (and lights and music) if she's really awake and the lights and music only if she's already a bit sleepy. It is truly wonderful! We traveled with it as well and it really held up, in checked baggage on the airlines through three connections each way. If I were going to change anything it would be to make the volume go even a bit lower, but this is very minor. Overall we love it and would be lost without it! I keep spare batteries on hand at all times!"
1,An awful textbook!,This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book.
1,Waste of money,This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money.
2,GREAT REFERENCE BOOK! GLAD I HAD IT!,I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy 1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her 1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book.
2,Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal,I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
1,Feels disconnected,"Although my kids (5, 4, and 2) enjoy the pictures, the storyline felt disconnected/lacked smooth transitions. I had to explain a lot of what was going on to my kids rather than the story telling itself as most children's books do."
1,Avoid buying this product!,I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them. What a fool I was. This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio. Avoid buying this product. I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me. DO NOT buy this product (Sennheiser R40).
1,Esta versión está recortada,"La novela es genial, inmortal, imperecedera. Pero esta versión que vende Amazon es un versión recortada e incompleta, casi la mitad de la novela que autorizó Tolstoi. No sé si es la misma versión que edita en papel la editorial Juventud que es la mitad de la novela completa. Fue un chasco para mí descubrirlo, pues ya la tenía en papel en la edición de Planeta con la traducción de Alcántara y Laín Entralgo e introducción de Eduardo Mendoza y al compararlas me di cuenta. Espero que Amazon ponga a la venta esta novela en la versión completa, preferiblemente en la traducción de Lydia Kuper. Pr eso mi valoración es por esta versión en concreto no a la novela en sí."
2,Wonderful read,"I started this book because my son is a rower and I'd hoped to learn a bit more about the techniques and the mindset of rowers. Sara Hall provides that, but so much more. Her account of coming to grips with an abusive relationship is delicate and sensitive. Many middle-class women can see themselves caught in a subtle dance with a domineering, controlling, cagey husband. The strength she finds through rowing and her connection to community is beautifully portrayed. I encourage every woman to read it."
2,Incredible,One of the best games ever to play against your friends. A top five game as far as the n64 was concerned. Its a game hat changes the football rules slightly while still holding the integrity of what the sport is. Just incredible as far as the fun factor goes. Definately a game that makes pulling the n64 out of the closet. Five stars all the way!
2,First-rate film,"Not being an ""action"" movie buff, I was somewhat surprised that I was hooked on this film. Everything about it was superb. Well acted, very well directed and kept my interest right up to the final credits. The description of this film as a gay ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was apt, although I still look forward to the day when we don't have to use ""gay"" to describe a film as anything other than what it is, a great film."
1,not easy set-up,"The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore."
2,A Real Hit with Our 18-month old Grandson,"I got this for our 18-month old grandson for Christmas and this was just the thing for him to satisfy his craving to climb in, around, and behind things! It was larger than I expected, big enough for both of us to sit in, which he loved. Its only been up two days but it seems durable because in the beginning he seemed to try batting it around to test it out and it held up admirably. The colors are bright and it seems well made. I feel certain that he'll play in it often."
1,Not impressed,"I was disappointed in the tent part of this set. It's flimsy, and the corners slide/collapse in too easily making the floor space much smaller. The tunnel part is great, though. I much prefer the pop-up house that my kids have."
1,so so good,"Works most of the time, But Id say every 1 out of 5 staples didnt not come even close to sinking into the wood. We spent a lot of time with a hammer and a punch going back over each staple making sure it was flushed. very time consuming."
1,not received yet,"article not received yet, not know the causes , but i will be grateful if you send any information about that ."
2,"Easy, delicious and nutritous","Easy to make, great tasting, and excellent nutritional value. I add chrushed ice to give it a frosty shake texture."
2,Loose Weight the Healthy way,"I lost almost 20 pounds just by taking herbalife nothing really worked for me, i was so desperate didn't know what to do...I even try diet pills over the counter but i always got a side effect by taking them. I'm still loosing weight from 250 pounds to 160 pounds (oh yeah baby), Like the song says I'M BRINGING SEXY BACK YEAH! Make sure to use formula 1 shake mix and 3 protein, just replace a meal if you don't eat breakfast like me drink the shake every morning ....2 scoops of shake mix and 1 scoop of proteinand you'll see results NOT KIDDING!"
1,Hmm...,"Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits, but beware! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later. When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad! I'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes (the chocolate one is delicious by the way). I hope it really works out for other people, but sadly this product just wasn't for me."
1,FAKE PRODUCT!!!!,"This is not a real product from Herbalife, that's why its cheap. It's fake and won't buy it again. I recommend to purchase Herbalife products only from reliable distributors not online. Most products that are sold online already expired. I will report this to Herbalife!"
2,VERY GOOD,"It was more than an anime, it got something else something, this perpective, it was more than it, the ending was explendid, when they way part of your life is maravillous talk, and all, and make you think, have your life been as wonderful, and also make me think when i grow up, isn't betaiful."
1,Clueless!!,"This movie will leave you staring dumbfounded at your screen in disbelief - that you actually sat through 88 minutes of this appalling excuse for entertainment. The characters were as superficial as the plot was non-existent. A couple of cuss words and Sienna Guillory's breasts were thrown in to give it an R rating but truthfully the DVD box should have carried a government health warning. Whatever you do DO NOT buy this movie. Don't even waste the time or money renting it. Alicia Silverstone and Joe Anderson fail to explore their relationship in any dimension whatsoever, and resort to repeated meant-to-be passionate clinches because they literally have nothing to say to each other. And that's it!"
1,"a beautiful set, but what's the point if the story is nonexistant?","A pointless film that's trying to be as mysterious and mystical as possible and winds up being nothing but boring. Watching the film, there's a sense that there will be some big revelation, something in the script that will make the movie tie together, but that something never appears. In fact, the ending is even more ambiguous than the rest of the film. This movie is nothing but an exercise to show Alicia Silverstone in different stages of undress, and even those scenes aren't very revealing. The entire movie winds up being one bad mind game, or maybe a good one (depending on how you look at it; after all, the game is to get you to watch the movie). The scenery and photography are pretty good but do not make the film redeemable by any means."
2,"great cd, speedy delivery","This cd is exactly what I hoped it would be. I play it while I'm cooking or entertaining because it is perfect background music. It makes me want a fondue pot and a set of bongos. Oh,wait, I have bongos already! Anyway, for someone ready to explore latin jazz this is a perfect intro. For those already into latin jazz, Cal Tjader is a must-have. I plan on expanding my collection of his music."
1,A Very Difficult Book from which to Learn HTML,"I have now struggled with this book for many hours, and I am still in ignorance of such basic things as ""where is white space allowed in HTML,"" ""when is it case-sensitive, if ever,"" and ""when are double quotes required and when not."" This book may or may not be a good reference -- I can't tell -- but if you are trying to get started, it is not the right book."
2,Excellent Content,"While this book was written by a number of authors all seemed to have made it easy for me to understand what they were writing. Hey, if they can explain to me what's up in the world of HTML, anyone can learn it and this is the book to do it with."
1,Travel Converter,"The Converter appears to be fine, except that it only came with the larger plugs used in northern Europe, not the smaller plugs used in southern Europe."
2,Brilliant collection.,"This double disc anthology does a wonderful job of spanning Be Bop Deluxe's collected works. The strongest cuts, and the majority of the collection, come from Sunburst Finish, Modern Music, and Futurama(now out of print). The wonderful live album, Live in the Air Age(also out of print), is represented by only two cuts. There are four from the generally weak Axe Victim and a handful from their inconsistent swan song Drastic Plastic. There are also a few rarities tossed in as an added bonus. Bill Nelson's creativity, musicianship(he is a sorely underated guitarist), and songwriting are truly outstanding. This collection is highly recommended...Simon"
1,The Ashen Thief,"I got dissapointed with this book. the ashen knight was a very good book centered in the knighthood, but in this one they lost that focus, the furores chapter shouldn't be in a book about thiefs, should be more in an Ashen Anarchist.The first part about the medieval underworld is good, but they screw up the rest of the book with the furores section."
1,I can make it better!,"I recently purchased a DD50 from ebay - and it was about what I expected. Yamaha make generally good trusty products - but this kit has the same basic flaw as all electronic druma I have tried - that is - the pads do not pick up light strokes - and also don't respond to heavy hits. In other words they don't react anything like real drums.Ok this is a very cheap unit so you get what you pay for right? - well actually - I did design and market electronic drums (analogue type) back in the eighties - and I spent a long time working on this ""response"" thing - eventually getting very impressive results.So when I got the DD50 recently I immediately set about improving things - and I have devised a fairly simple way of improving the response drastically with a bit of add-on circuitry.If you are interested please email me. mickwest1@hotmail.com"
2,Ella sings,"I think this is a very good album, but not Ella's best work. Mostly she sticks very close to the melody and words only infrequently adding her own touches, flourishes - style."
1,Had meant to get a 3 USB cord,"When I got the procut, saw I had made a mistake, had wanted a 3 USB cable, but these were so cheap, that I could not send them back, may never use them, but the cost was that good of a bargain."
2,Excellent,"This product is an amazing price for the quality it produces. As well as an incredible saving price which is extremely low for such a cable. Great delivery, arrived in just 3 days of ordering the product. To recap; amazing product, amazing price, amazing delivery. All in all great service and speed. Thank you ELMENOS for this product."
2,A solid anime title,"This anime is a very nice one that is pretty good for its time. The characters are easy to adapt to and some of the moments are very hilarious. The only thing I didnt really aprove of were the tanks. With a name like Tank Police, you'd expect there to be some really cool tank designs, but the action made up for it. The action is very intense and exciting. Seeing a tank jump on to the wing of a plane was so cool. I just wish U.S. Manga would put more thought into the subtitles. The subtitles were so small and hard to read. That aside, I really like this title and I will propably buy the DVD."
2,the best album ive heard in a while,"excellent combination of electronic, jazz, and hip-hop with dark musical elements. my favorite is sanity requiem, but could have done with out the john walker track."
1,Disapointing,"The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists."
2,All Things Ocean,"Great story, full of suspense. The surprises will keep you glued to your seat from the beginning to the end. You practically are in the water with the actors. Great movie."
2,Awsome....but....,"This is definaately one of the best DVD's around. The options are incredible and both versions are awsome. The only problem I had with the DVD is the fact that it seems like the sound transfer was unbalanced. the dialoug seemed too quiet at parts and i had to constantly lower and raise the levels. otherwise, this is a must have for any movie fan."
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first and only version of the movie. Get the 5 star collection.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator is DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
1,"""The Abyss"" Single Disc Edition--Misleading Advertising !!!",Just want to make you all aware that the single disc edition for the DVD THE ABYSS has misleading sound options.The back of the disc jacket states that English 5.1 sound is available.When you engage the menus only English or French surround sound are available.I blew my stack when I noticed this and now I am stuck with an inferior product.
1,The first song is truncated,"""Opinion # 33"" is really a 5 minute 5 second long song. The 3:24 song that Amazon has is truncated. Amazon should fix this."
2,Angels on my Kindle - Amazon experience,Our pastor was doing a series of sermons based on this book. We were not required to purchase the book. I am so glad I did. The book contained more information about angels than I had ever expected. The content was based on Holy Scripture (The Bible) and cited references. Reading this book inspired me to read more books on angels. This was the first book I had read written by Billy Graham. I had no idea what a great author he was. I have since ordered other books by Billy Graham and am pleased with them all.
2,Excellent Book,"Billy Graham really brings home the reality of angels in this book and how they are not some imaginary beings, but mighty warriors used by God for His purposes."
1,Power Jacked,"I bought it in January 2004 and the power jack went bad in January 2006. I bought a laptopp on the cheap end, knowing that it would either break or be outdated in a couple of years, and here I am, just as predicted.I have to call Kenmore, now. My two year old refrigerator just stop refrigerating. Ah, the age of great quality and service! (Yes, Mr. Steve. I am sorry to here about your broken equipment, Mr. Steve. I'm sorry, but it seems I can not help you. Please hold.)"
2,"fresh, independent research lifts a curtain of secrecy","My Democrat friend begged me to read one chapter, 'just this one chapter' she said. I was bitten by the information, by Mr. Umile's straight-forward writing style and read the entire book.His voice is fresh, he's a political independent who tracked down incredible information on Mr. Bush, his family and regime; how can I ignore the facts. Just the facts.Read this and weep my fellow Republicans."
1,booooo!,wow this has got to be the worst game i have ever played. I mean really who wants to go around and deliver papers for a video game when they could be on quests to save the world. instead of quests to get a good tip.
2,You're missing alot by overlooking this album!,"Let's put it this way, words are not enough to describe how great this album truly is. A collection of songs filled with hope, love and ""Positivity""! Get It!"
1,Radio ratios,"2 1/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai, and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room, unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies. The clue as for which tracks to avoid? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding."
1,This book is garbage!,"Do not waste your money ! Instead of bying this junk, look for other publishers. A good recommendation would be the Sybex's titles: WOSA I and WOSA II separetely. After failing twice, I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read."
1,WA I & II for dummies written by dummies!,I have to agree with the past couple of recent postings! THIS BOOK WILL IN NO WAY PREPARE YOU TO PASS THE EXAMS! Trump one up for Bill and his gang at Redmond for taking our money and laughing all the way to the bank. Save your money and look elsewhere!
1,Should be titled 'A Brief Intro to MS Windows',"Good news: the book has great style, format and layout. Bad news: content. I waited until I passed my WinArch exams before I could objectively review this book. This book doesn't 'offer complete preparation for taking and passing MCSD exams 70-160 and 70-161' like the blurb on the book cover states. I complained to MS Press and MCP regarding this statement and a rep from MCP.com admitted (via email) that 'no one source of reference is sufficient to pass the exam'. Too bad MSPress didn't consult MCP (or that person) before designing the book cover. If you are new to programming then you will learn a lot about Windows by reading this book BUT you won't be able to pass the exams! I'm writing to MS Press to request a refund. I suggest everyone who has purchased this book do the same."
1,"Good overview maybe, but for passing tests, NO WAY!",I took and passed both WinArch 1 & 2 and this book was NO HELP! Don't waste your time with this book unless you are new to Windows Development. I covered more of what was on WinArch preparing for the VB5 Exam than reading this book. The best preparation by far is still the MSDN Library and Transcender as a guide to what to read. I wish MS would support the MCSD program as much as they support MCSE.
1,Begginer content written for an expert,"This has begginer level content, although is too complex for any begginer. Only purchase this book if you already know C and Perl, and have no knowledge of CGI.There are much better simple free tutorials online that could describe the basis of CGI."
2,The holy one is dethroned,"God Dethroned's vocals can sometimes lack in quality, but their amzing riffs make up for any lost. This double-disc offers many quality black/death metal songs. Warkult is the song that i get hooked on the most. I suggest listening to them on the metal blade site before you buy it, just incase it isn't what you expected."
1,Boring in the extreme,"I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!"
1,Huge Disappointment!,"Don't remember when I've been so let down, especially given the high level of praise from the reviewers I read before purchasing. Gave up in frustration after completing less than 25% of the book.What a sad collection of wordy FLUFF!"
2,"As classics go, it's pretty classic","Rarely have I enjoyed a classic with more surprise than Middlemarch. It looks to be an endless and boring morality tale from the plot summary, but reads like a work of high psychological art.The only other writer who has taken me so convincingly inside the thoughts of so many characters is Shakespeare. A strong compliment, but Eliot shows that she had the goods and somehow weaves an epic and beguilingly entertaining tale out of a quite depressing subject and period.I recall not wanting this book to end; for an 800-pager, that's strong praise indeed.They don't write 'em like this anymore!I love this Penguin edition; they've been doing it right for so long that their versions of the classics have all the right, simple touches.Truly great writing makes you feel ennobled for having read it; Middlemarch is most decidedly one of those books."
1,Contrive Hard!,"An action-filled yet unsatisfying sequel to the 1988 classic. Bruce Willis' engaging performance as the intrepid John McClane is weighed down by a contrived screenplay and lack of memorable villains. Filmmaker Renny Harlin would fare better in the stunt-filled Sylvester Stallone romp ""Cliffhanger."" Avoid ""Die Hard 2"" and proceed directly to ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) - a superior follow-up that reunited Willis with original director John McTiernan."
2,"Intriguing, Non Stop Reading","Once again, Kimberla Lawson Roby has out done herself! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone who wants a fiction novel that they CANNOT put down. Ms. Roby makes you want to read while youre sleeping to see the outcome of the story's plot. Although I could not put this book down, I did not want to see it end :( Ms. Roby, keep up the excellent work and please, continue to write fiction novels worth reading. Hope to see you at the African Spectrum Bookstore in Georgia again soon."
1,didn't like it.,I thought this book was slow and boring. The characters wre not well developed and I didn't like the author's writing style. The book was amateurishly written. I do not recommend this book.
2,Such an exciting and interesting book!,"I recently finished reading "" Casting The First Stone"". This book was simply amazing. This was my first time reading a book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I have seen her name around, but I never read one of her books before. I am a member of the Black Expressions book club, and that is where I ordered this book. Pastor Curtis Black was a trip and half. That man was so low down. I didn't think he could get any lower, but I was wrong. Although I enjoyed the book, it would've been nice to know why Curtis did all that cheating. The book could've used some background information on Curtis. But I must say that Kimberla has captured my interest, and now I'll be on the lookout for more of her books. I don't really have a favorite female author. I can read anything by anyone, be it male or female. But I will certainly be looking out for her. I'm about to let my sister read "" Casting The First Stone"". And I'll be starting Eric Jermome Dickey's "" Liars Game"""
2,I couldn't put it down to save my life!,"Kim Roby has done it! this book is such a gripping look into one woman's pain filled struggle with her husband that just happens to be a man of the cloth. Man of the Flesh would have been more apporpriate. Tanya Black is an strong, successful woman with a husband that can't be faithful if he tried. This novel spins the web of decit, pain and plenty of get back. The writing is clear and vivid. I could see the emotion laced within the words and I could feel the pain, fear and faith of each character. Kim, you've done it. This is the first of your works that my bookclub has read, but with writing like this, IT WON'T BE THE LAST! The Eye of RA Bookclub."
1,Really?!? I have to have a PH-D and rank in the 90th Percentile in the GRE to learn and run A MVT test?,"Honestly QualPro, Some of the stuff I really liked in the book. But as soon as you began to belittle my intelligence by telling me that I need to have a PHD in Stats, and rank in the 90 th percentile in the GRE. Then you lost most of my interest. Why don't you STOP belittling everyone else to sell your process. Lean and Six Sigma are all good. ANY processes that drives continuous improvement (including yours QualPro) is a good thing. Is yours better than everyone else's? who knows? BUT I do know that you don't need to bash ever other CIP process or method to make you feel good. Focus on what you are doing, and if it is good it will be accepted and used, but the fact that you feel like you have to bring down others to build yourself up is pathetic!"
1,This Electric Youth Needs a Jolt,"The art is the reason to purchase this, if indeed you do. Oeming works in black-and-white Mignola territory here. And occasionally the script spins a nice turn of phrase or matches up effectively with the pretty pictures, in spite of itself.But it tried to hard to be self-consciously arty and poetic. It was like an early Bradbury plot written in late prose, filtered through acid flashbacks -- lyrical but disjointed. I suppose one could argue that it was a success, if it was trying to be dreamlike, but in the light of day a dream still needs to make sense upon interpretation. And this didn't.Can I describe the story? Not so much. A bitter woman, a cuckolded husband, and a neglected daughter. Is she alive, or dead? Is she able to exert influence regardless? Was it a dream? A metaphor? Brought about by a horseshoe to the head? Or ended that way? Let me know if *you* can tell.Look for it in the quarter bin, maybe."
2,This is so kool,"This is really great. There are 2 analog sticks and this thing vibrates!! That so kool. If you you don't want it to vibrate, you could turn it off in the option mode of the game. And it is compatable with all PlayStations!"
1,Disappointed,I was really disappointed in this purchase. The music was not what I expected. It is not a good choice for a Yoga class. More disappointing is that I can't return it.
1,Dull attempt to ape Hitchcock's style,"Highly stylized effort at film noir by Kenneth Branagh, matching the tortuously dull love-affair between his private-eye and Thompson's amnesiac with a cliche-ridden attempt at a genre he either misunderstands completely or must secretly loathe. Derek Jacobi is excellent as usual, and the plot does finally gather some pace, but by this time its a question of making the best of a bad job."
1,Buy the DVD for Branagh's Commentary,"I thought the film was way over the top on mood and effects. It was a complete distraction from the characters and plot. I think it could have been much easier to watch if it had been filmed with 1/2 the intensity. But the cast is wonderful and Branagh's commentary on the DVD gives great information about film making, the challenges to stage the scenes, and the process of refining the story. I will buy the DVD to get the commentary and will watch that much more than the film."
1,Boring....,Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
2,Their Best,"The Beatles released many fine albums during the 60s, but ""Magical Mystery Tour"" was their finest. There is not a single weak track on this record. The Beatles never released an album with as many #1 hits as ""Magical Mystery,"" including ""Penny Lane,"" ""All You Need Is Love,"" and ""Hello, Goodbye."" The other songs aren't bad either. ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is the best song John ever wrote, while the title track and ""Fool On the Hill"" are enough to make an album gold or platinum for another rock group. While the film was a colossal flop, the soundtrack shows psychedlic rock at its best."
2,"Magical mystery tour... OH,BUT ITS TRUE!!!!!!!!!","Recently,a poll was taken as to which beatle songs were the best ever, and a bunch of them came from magical mystery tour.Oh,it sure is true,magical mystery tour rules!!!!!"
1,Magical Mystery Tour,"Horns, flutes, instrumentals and bad vocals. How can one resist? There are lots of descriptives of this album, but ""masterpiece"" isn't one of them.The title song starts off with potential, but fades quickly, and most of the rest of the record is pretty forgettable, especially Hello Goodbye, and All You Need is Love which sound very outdated."
1,Check the Track Listing,"Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Baby You're A Rich Man. Did the group just not try to write a complete album or were they out of ideas? The so-called better tracks, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fiels suffer from Paul's lightweight writing and John's nasally singing - ""Straw Berry Fieeeelds For Eveh..""Ugh.Who knows, but it sure doesn't stand up to anything before or after its release. Anyone who rates this 5-stars is simply swept up in the Beatles. They can't be listening to the music."
2,The Best Pop Album Ever Made,"Denizens of the Seattle area are long used to seeing me drive around on sunny days, windows open, playing Magical Mystery Tour in my car deck and singing the tunes at the top of my voice. The very apotheosis of Pop. How can you NOT like an album with songs like ""Strawberry Fields"", ""Penny Lane"", ""I Am The Walrus"", ""Hello, Goodbye"", ""Blue Jay Way"", and the anthem of the 60's, ""All You Need Is Love""? Eh? God Save the British Empire!"
2,Great movie about the disaster at Pearl Harbor,I have this movie on VHS and wanted a copy on DVD. This is a great movie.
2,The version,I Really like war movies and this is the definitive version of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The effects are great and the historical background are precise. It's superior to the recent Pearl Harbor film. This is the movie!
2,TORA! TORA! TORA! WINNWR WINNER! WINNER!,"Great quality, arrived sooner than expected, great price. NO SHOPPING MALLS OR HUNTING FOR PARKING!!! I could just kick back and watch a favorite."
1,Buyer Beware,"When I first purchased this vacuum I was very impressed with the ability it had to suck up pet hair. I have a cat and a dog and it seemed to work wonderfully at getting the hair out of the carpets. However, 9 months later the vacuum has become a piece of junk. It simply blows the dirt it ""sucks up"" right out the back side of the vacuum and back all over the area just vacuumed. I am not the only person experiencing this, I had recommend the vacuum to a friend that told me the other day he ended up so mad that he threw it out into his yard and went back to his 20 year old Kirby. And his machine is only about 6 months old. Since both of these units were purchased through Amazon, there seems to be no recourse on any type of return warranty coverage. The only thing that sucks with this vacuum is the fact that I paid $90 bucks for it!"
2,So far it's great,"I researched tons of vacuums before purchasing this one. I wanted the best I could get for around $100. This is the first time I've owned a bagless vacuum and I was a bit concerned that it would be messy to empty it. Turns out not to be a problem. Everything detaches easily. If you were to open it over the garbage and shake it out, then some of the dust will fly around cause of the shaking. I just set it in a plastic bag, open, and lift it up and everything comes out mess free in the bag. The automatic cord rewind thing was not a selling point for me when I purchased it, but now I don't ever want to own a vacuum without it - it's so convenient. I gave it four stars only because it is a little bit heavy, but not too much to be a problem for me."
2,A fantastic vacuum for the price!,I bought this vacuum four months ago and it works great! Easy to use and really seems very powerful. Picks up things from your carpet that you didn't even see. The push-button release for the dirt container makes it very simple to empty. This is an excellent vacuum for the price. I use about a mid-range height setting for my carpets and it works great.
2,Extremely pleased!,"I was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment, so I did some research and read a lot of reviews about many different vacuums. After much hemming and hawing over which one would suit me, I decided upon this one and I was pleasantly surprised! This vacuum has really nice suction and it doesn't seem to lose that the longer the vacuuming session runs; it also really fluffs up the carpet. I have a dog and she does shed. This vacuum does a really good job at picking up the hair. I have been able to use the pet attachment tool and that works pretty well. Animal hair is stubborn anyway, so I needed a little patience to suck it all up and get those little hairs that were entwined with the fabric fibers. I am glad that I purchased this vacuum. One caution though, when you use the hose, the main agitator still runs. So, be careful what your vacuum is sitting on or you will have a worn spot on your carpet if you let the vacuum sit in one place for too long."
1,Stopped Working,"I wonder if the same people who gave this vacumn high ratings would give the same rating after six months. Mine worked well for about six months and stopped working this past weekend. I had it cleaned out thoroughly and replaced the belt, but the power would not come on. My first thought was that the built-in Thermal Protector shut it down because of overheating. It should then reset itself after 30 minutes. Well...it's been two days....I would think that you would want your vacumn works longer than six months. If so, please consider another product that is not made by Hoover. Good Luck if you decided to give this a try because of other reviews."
1,worked once,"i bought this 5 months ago -- it worked just fine out of the box ... the 2nd time i used it, it wouldn't pick up even a dried piece of a leaf, i could only get any pickup using the hose which is a back breaking process ... i've tried every setting on carpet and area rugs ... have finally decided it is a total waste of money. Folks - I so recommend you not purchase this."
1,Updated Feedback,"I have updated my feedback for this product because the container cap fall off while I was removing the dust from the container. The part of the plastic connection that holds the cap was broken (opened it only a few times). Although I was able to close the container now, I am afarid to open it the next time."
1,Defective unit features,"After about 2-3 months, I had problems with the extension tube's rotating brush head. The brush stopped rotating, meaning that it now simply gets in the way of airflow. And the main body takes two or three passes to get some very easy, lightweight things up. I also agree: it's bad to leave the thing running in one spot because it will friction damage your carpet, which is a bad flaw. So when you use the (badly designed) extension tube, watch out. Another problem: if you run one side of the main floor unit under a narrow rim, i.e. a cabinet, the main vac belt tends to come off. This cleaner needed more testing and was marketed too quickly."
2,economical and efficient,"I thought at first that the vacuum was extremely hard to push until I realized that the lowest setting was for smooth floors rather than carpet. Once I adjusted the dial, the vacuum moved much more easily. It has great suction and picks up so much dirt and dog hair from my carpet that I'm embarrassed about my housekeeping. I really like being able to see in the clear cylinder what it's picking up from the floor, and it is very easy to empty the canister. The cord rewinder is excellent. The vacuum's a bit loud, but no more than most that I've had. It's definitely worth the money."
1,Junk,"Wife bought this vacuum about a year ago. It has sucked since day 1. Hate it. Piece of junk. Smells like burning rubber, no suction, belts burn out constantly (probably why it smells like it is on fire all the time), shoots dust particles into the atmosphere leading to increased global warming (o.k. kidding about the ""contributes to global warming""). Wish this vacuum cleaner had never entered into my life. Avoid."
2,Hoover U55607-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright,"This vacuum works great. It works so much better then expensive ones that I bought.The suction is awesome. It's not to heavy. Would recomend it to anyone who has athritis, because of how you can adjust the handle."
1,Absolute Junk,"This vacuum is compete junk. After owning it less than it for a month my wife and I had it into the Hoover service center 4 times. The store technician said, in not so many words, that it was complete junk and they have nothing but problems with them. So when I asked about the warranty that I had officially registered through their website, the manager told me that the company had been restructured and that I should just purchase a better model. So when I ask to return the deffective product and get credit towards a better model, he informed me that the only credit would go towards the standard retail price and since they were already having a holiday sale, the credit he could giive me would not benefit me at all. I would recommend avoiding this model and Hoover's all togethr if possible. Their warranty is worthless and their service centers basically told us that since the product was junk to begin with, there isn't much that they could do for us."
1,A Headache of a Vacuum,"The thing burned through belts. One time I replaced 2 belts in one vacuuming session--and yes I installed them properly and they weren't rubbing against anything.My guess is that it's the quality of the belts--or should I say lack of quality.Even after two years, the vacuum, when ran, would fill the house with a hot rubber smell.The tubes were also prone to clogging and I've had to pull it apart numerous times to push dust clogs through so it would work properly.After two years, the vacuum just stopped when the motor burned out. I did us a favor.The cord retractor was neat; at least they got that part right."
2,good product,"I've used this hoover for one month and it works pretty well. Easy to use and all the parts work fine. The filters are effective. A little bit stiff and heavy, but I never had a big hoover like this, so it might be normal. It doesn't recline too much. I recommend it. Good deal for the price."
1,Broke after one year,"I know that companies design (very cleverly) products to go bad after a certain amount of time, and sure enough, this Hoover did just that after 1 year and 9 days. The motor overheated once last month (waited an hour and it reset) and then it just stopped sucking up anything soon thereafter (probably around 20% of what it once was capable of). Now it's time to move on to another brand... (MADE IN CHINA anyone?!)There should be a Class Action set up for us against ALL companies (& their products) with ANY parts made in China. Times have changed."
2,fuzzfree,"I have newer carpet in my military housing home. And since it isn't the best of carpets we get alot of fuzz from it, even five months later. Our old vacuum, which was small, just wasn't cutting it so I decided to look for one on Amazon. When the vacuum came my husband and I were both happily suprised at the features. The dirt cup is great with a very clean release and we love the cord rewind feature too. Over all we're very happy with the purchase!"
2,Fantastic Vacuum - Hoover,"We brought this because of the reviews we read and they were right, it is a great vacuum and it is a bonus that it has a HEPA filter. We recently moved into a new apartment and my husband got very bad sinus in the new apartment, I think they may have had a cat there previously. Although the carpet looked clean I used the new Hoover on it and wow there was so much cat hair and dust it was amazing what it picked up and suddenly my husband no longer had sinus. It is easy to empty, the only down side is it is a bit heavy to push. It was also a great price on Amazon."
1,Wish I'd Read Reviews Before Buying,"Purchased this vacuum just after Christmas, wish I'd read the reviews first. I'm 64 so I've had quite a few vacuums and this is the least user friendly one I've ever owned. The only thing good about it is the retractable cord. It doesn't pick up dog hair very well and after emptying, it's a pain to get back together. I'm taking it back to Target."
1,Poor Quality construction,I purchased this for my 7 year old. He is really in to hot Wheels. He is pretty good about being careful with his toys but with an hour of opening this new toy he was taping the doors back on. This product is very low quality. The wheels have fallen off the cars. I would avoid buying this.
2,Creative fun is good fun,"This set combined with other sets, provides my son with hours of creative fun. I have found that to be able to build a variety of structures, it takes a total of about 350 pieces. So this was an addition to 2 other different sets already purchased."
2,"yoga, meditation, massage music to enjoy while reading",My students love this CD in yoga class and I enjoy it also at home while reading or meditating with a lavendar candle burning. It really is a Healing to listen to.
2,Amazing and insightful,"Beth Sipe writes about her exeperiences as a battered woman in this emotionally charged biography. She talks about the years of living with her abuser and raising her children in a home that was never without pain and abuse. She fights the legal system, mental health system, police, and military for support for years, but never gets the help with her situation without challenges.She tries to leave several times and even when she is able to get a restraining order, her husband violates it. Finally she is able to take no more and does something that will forever change her life and the life of her children.This is a must read for anyone working in domestic violence or for those who have lived with abuse and are on the road to recovery."
2,An Underappreciated Capra Classic,"I love this movie. All of Frank Capra's films are great, but this is the one I like the most(this and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU). It's a wonderful story of a ""woman of the street"" trying to put on a good show for her daughter when she comes to visit(and introduce her fiance). It's a touching and funny film and goes sadly unheralded(at least Criterion released in on laserdisc). I often think of it in the same class with the Barbara Stanwyck classic, STELLA DALLAS. A must for any classic film fan, an absolute must."
2,WARREN AND MAY ARE GREAT!!!!!,"I love this film, although I have to agree that the print suffers. I wouldn't be that concerned about it if it wasn't for Capra Jr. raving about it as much as he did. Overall his commentary is interesting although somewhat repetitive. ""Lady For a Day"" is a real classic and should have been on Criterion."
1,Broken!,"We bought this as a birthday gift and when it was opened - it was broken inside the box. I am glad I also purchased a strobe light or the kids would have been so disappointed! And, instead of being able to exchange it - you can only return to amazon from this seller and there was no way to conact the seller to have them send us a working one."
1,A broken item was sent,I received a broken item from the seller. This is the first time I received an undesirable product from Amazon and I will think twice to order something in future.I needed that item for a special occation and somehow managed to glue the pieces. I did not return this item to the seller.Krish Mukhopadhyay
1,The reviews are true about the bulb!,"Bought it for a small band gig we are gonna have. The package comes really secure and, as usual, amazon has been great with the shipping. The real problem I had was the bulb wasn't turning on THE FIRST TIME I tried it. The rotating ball is working so I figured out I just got a broken bulb. Bought a new bulb (bulb description at the bottom doesn't match the actual bulb you will need). Still wouldn't work. FML for throwing the box right away. Now I have this in my garage, useless"
1,UNoriginal!!!,"A straight guy who wants to have a female-dominant threesome? Let's see: this has already been done in ""Trois"" and ""Just One Time."" Just as those movies stunk, so does this one. This movie could have been called ""The Look-alike Film."" The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother. The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation. In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from ""Oz,"" the one on death row.This film says it has ""sexual content,"" but it could have run on non-cable TV. There is no nudity whatsoever. The plot is predictable. I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment. This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities."
2,cheap price works well,thats all i can say about it. it fits my toyota 96 camry and it seems to be better than my previous gas cap
2,Awesome game,"If you like action and great moves, then this is your game. The game is entertaining and definitely worth the money. I would recommend this game to all who love fighting games."
2,not perfect,The lastest chapter is not good. The style is Different with above. Look like other author write it.
2,Good but wordy,"It is a good book for you to pass SCBCD. All content focuses on exam objectives. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because it is too wordy. Some people might love the book since it makes them smile. But if your goal is only to pass SCBCD, the wordy content is useless and wastes your time.Anyway, I passed SCBCD with 91% by using this book."

1,Buy the book instead,"I know, I know. A book and a video are two different art forms and you shouldn't compare them to each other. But after reading the utterly hilarious book based on this series, the actual video was a disappointment. Slow and boring describe it best. Natually the video can't introduce Root's interior dialogues, so we're left with minimal dialogue. Also, some episodes (in the book with pictures) were apparently edited out of the video. Too bad -they were hilarious. Stick to the printed word on this one if you want hysterically cutting British sarcasm."
1,Comments on Crowd Madness,"Was disappointed that so much of the original book was left out in order to focus on investor psychology. MacKay was a master of crowd psychology in its many forms, in addition to investment matters."
2,Informative and interesting - Maybe not for a beginner,"I really enjoyed this book. Written in the 1950s, is has an interesting view of the 1920s through the lens of a post-war intellectual. Giving evenhanded accounts of Wilson, the Roosevelts, Smith, McAdoo, Coolidge, Hoover, and other major players of the period, the author manages to critically analyze the era leading up to the depression without condemning it in broad strokes.Leuchtenburg does a particularly good job of defending Hoover as a capable and intelligent man with little tolerance for playing politics and an incredibly poorly dealt hand dealt to him. He is also critical of the often beautified TR.The Perils of Prosperity is a worthy read for anyone interested in the social and political machinations of the early 20th century."
2,A great second volume,"As of always Norman Geisler pumps out another book , which is very clear and sharp on the doctrines of God and the origins of creation.This book and also with his first volume is a must for all theological thinkers.I cant wait until his next volume comes out. Does any one know how many volumes there will be ?."
1,Curious about this book!,"I am curious to read this book it sounds inspiring. It is really nice to hear a story about someone who recovered from tragedy. I too am skeptical about the idea of dialysis to treat or overcome schizophrenia. I think it does a bit of a disservice to people with serious mental illness who have to take or often refuse medication with difficult side effects to advocate an experimental and risky ""cure"" with no significant treatment outcomes but it's a definite read."
2,Travel Prep for Italy.,"I checked this out to get more background before a trip to Italy. I am going to recommend it for a young (middle school) friend in anticipation of future travel.I appreciate things more if I know why it is so special. I can imagine this age group could be pretty bored if they don't ""get"" why this stuff is so special & they'd rather be home with their video games. Donatello is more than a turtle with attitude."
1,Komplete Mess,"This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4! The graphics are awful,the sound and music is ear aching,and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy...like total krap! Actually,it may even be worse than MK3! Avoid this at all costs!"
1,What planet am I on?,What planet am I on.....isn't this earth? I have to check because I recently saw a terribly boring and vastly overrated movie called Dreamgirls. You would think from all the hype this movie got it would have been the best musical since the Wizard Of Oz! Instead what I saw was another example of a bunch of snob critics trying to sell me a chocolate covered lemon. I won't criticise each aspect because there isn't anymore time left to spend on this waste of a good two hours of time. Jennifer Hudson.....an Oscar.....for this.....FOGGEDDABBOUDDIT. And just when you thought Grease 2 was as bad as it gets. This is worse!
1,Not at all what I expected,"No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended."
1,"It does have a story, sort of","Repetitious. I lasted one hour watching this before I left the room. My spouse was able to watch it to the end and enjoy the story underneath.I gave Moulin Rouge one star, partly because of the shrill grating voices. At least Dream Girls has more natural voices. And it was fun to see how different performers of the era were represented by these fictional characters. And there was at least one educational piece of historical information: Elvis was not the original singer for Hound Dog. It was Big Mama Thornton, but her version was suppressed by mainstream white radio."
1,Ouch,"So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing."
1,Boring,This movie is totally boring. There is no plot. I am glad I just rented it from the local library.
1,NightmareGirls,"At about the 90 minute mark, I felt that my nightmare was just about over. I then remembered that there was about 40 minutes left to this string of cliches. I plan to start a 12-step recovery group for myself and others who have been traumatized by this travesty. What was so bad about it? Only the writing/acting/music/period-detail/directing...everything else was pretty good."
2,"""Dreamsgirls ""- A Dream Movie!","""Dreamgirls"" is an absolutely outstanding adaptation of the stage production. Jennifer Hudson absolutely shines. This is the first movie I have seen in many, many years where an audience was moved to cheer and applaud. During Jennifer's rendition of ""I am Telling You"", the audience responded as if we were at a live concert. ""Dreamgirls"" is a treat and an absolute delight. The acting, the singing, the musical score and the costumes are all award-winning calabre. I congratulate a great cast on their wonderful performance."
2,Best dvd edition ever,"This edition is worth the price. A 3rd disc which is a Target Exclusive features: ""One Night Only"" dance remix video (4 mins.) I luv the remix video. It's Faboulus!!!!"
1,Totally blah,This was a very uninteresting waste of time. Thank goodness C. S. Forrester wrote other novels; I would never have bought any of his novels if I had read this thing first.
1,First greek zombie flick ever...,"Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by.There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.A Cult movie because it's the first ever greek zombie flick but it will never be a classic one."
2,Like a drug you take by listening,"This music is incredibly relaxing. I have never listened to anything that helps me chill and think like this cd does. It leveled my thinking to a pace where I wasn't slow, but at the same time wasn't racing through ideas too fast to properly consider them. It is like a drug that is taken auditorily, by listening to it, and the effect is clarity of mind, calming of the spirit, and lucidity into one's life."
1,Nice retrospective... but not too informative,"Author rambles on about various old designs and the philosophies of the designers/builders, interspersing a few fuzzy B&W pictures and snippets of hull profiles. Might be interesting to the history buff, but if you want clear, relevant information on how to build a wooden boat... this book isn't for you. There are many others to choose from - I'd recommend Buehler's Backyard Boat Building and Gerr's Strength of Boats as two helpful books I've read so far."
1,Not For Those Who Wish To Build Boats,"The book is filled with stories about boats, not about boat building techniques or anything really of use to someone who is interested in building plywood boats, buyer beware! This title is misleading."
2,good purchase,"Thank you very much! I Recommend mixing this with apple juice, mango, banana and ice. Almond milk and banana is good too. I don't recommend it with berries, although the Macro reds might go well with them. Purchase a personal blender and your good to go!"
2,Actually Awesome,"For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being, I most certainly feel I owe a review. The actual ingredients would be good for anyone, but particularly helpful for one with low energy problems and difficulty eating all the fruit and vegetable servings recommended in our Food Pyramid (which I DO believe in). Also I am super caffeine sensitive and was relieved that the small amount of it in the green tea component didn't phase me in the least, i.e. no shakes. In total I simply have more energy that feels organic and am also calm because I feel better!"
1,Excess Sweetness and Filler,"What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods ."
2,Awesome piano trio jazz,"On this disc Kenny teams up with two other heavyweights, Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes. These fellows are no strangers to piano trios and this disc illustrates why. There are a variety of cuts from the lyrical Billy Strayhorn Passion Flower to some very aggressive modal jazz such as Madman. You hear some wonderful improvisation and the interplay between these gentlemen is wonderful to listen to. I have to say that their reading of Passion Flower ranks at the top of my list. Kenny really shows his dexterity in a very lyrical way. In the end it is the Bop influences that make this such interesting music to listen to. This disc is trio jazz at its finest."
2,Never Cry Wolf: Amazing True Story of Life Among Artic Wolves,"You'll laugh and you'll cry at the early adventures of this real life naturalist. Farley Mowat's writing is a joy to read, his words conjure up pictures in your mind and keep you turning the pages. Then you'll remember that there was a movie by the same title and you'll rent the CD which will also not disappoint you. After that, you'll want to know more about Mowat, his remarkable childhood and how he became the person he is today."
2,Wolf Behavior: Interesting and Entertaining,"This book is a quick and enjoyable read that will dispel some myths about wolves. The author traveled to a remote are of northern Canada in the summer of 1948 to study wolves, which were supposedly destroying the caribou population. The actual culprit turned out to be human hunters. His sympathetic descriptions probably didn't do much for his career with the Canadian government, but may have changed some minds about the threat that wolves pose to people.Excellent descriptions of wolf behavior in their natural habitat, including the interaction of an immediate family with pups and various groups that live in adjacent territories. Some of the behaviors he observed had not been seen before by scientists, and he was accused of fabricating them, but most of these observations have since been verified by others.At times, Mowat could be accused of attributing human motivations to animal behaviors. If this bothers you, you many not fully enjoy this book."
2,Which version to get?,"Well, I've read the reviews here and couldn't do any better. Also, I suggest you read Roger Ebert's take on this wonderful film. A must see for fans of Japanese cinema and for anyone who appreciates cinema as an art-form and not just entertainment.I own both the Milestone release and the Asmik release (got via Amazon.co.jp). I agree with [...] - the transfer and the director's cut/extras found on the Japanese Asmik version are far superior than Milestone's (and far cheaper). Try to find the Japanese version if you can. I'd be selling my Milestone version *to get rid of it* but I let my sister have it. Four and 1/2 stars."
2,Hypnotic,"A quiet, surreal, psychological horror story. There is much to contemplate in this tale of an entomologist, the woman with whom he is imprisoned, and the savage villagers who derive both their livelihood and a twisted sense of pleasure from the couple's predicament. It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices. The only flaw with this film is that it sometimes belabors the point."
1,What was i thinking?,I bought this game because it seemed like a pretty cool product. I was wrong! This game is not thrilling and it just doesn't seem to have a point. What were they thinking when they made this game? I sold mine because it was just useless to me. I didn't get very much but anything was better than keeping it around.
2,Lyrical prose. Masterfully told.,"The reason why it is so important to pay attention to description is because Richter uses nearly every detail to help tell the story. The prose is evocative in the tradition of some of the best modernist writing at the time like Willa Cather. Despite the occasional misplaced modifier, Sea of Grass is definitely a book that deserves a close reading--if only for Richter's poetic prose that makes you want to read out loud."
2,Just what I expected,Everything about the purchase was good and the meter is just what I expected. I have had cheap meters before and am thrilled with the upgrade.
1,"Great visual, poor plot","Nothing much happens in this movie. The movie moves so slow, 106 minutes feel like 4 hours. Of the 106 minutes, 90 are merely scenes of the African landscape accompanied by music. Yes, it is beautiful but I'd rather have a storyline.The social and sexual tensions are barely explored, they are barely grazed, merely hinted at. I fast forwarded through half the movie, hoping to stumble upon a good scene that never came. Slow moving, tediously boring and with a plot that is never explored. The racial relations are purely explored. We get more exploration of racial and sexual relations in ""Growing Pains - The Complete First Season"" PLUS a message of the week!"
1,A Lite Alternative,"Songs like ""Follow My Way"", ""Can't Change Me"" and ""Flutter Girl"" are admittedly catchy. Cornell's voice is strong throughout. But, ultimately, this is coming-out music for someone who just bought their first grunge clothes at JC Penney."
2,I wanted a LITTLE more Soundgarden,"I'm a more recent Soundgarden fan, but also a fan of Zeppelin, good vocals, good songwriting, and interesting guitar work. This album does not rock in a Soundgarden sense, and is more laid back.Still, the songwriting, guitar and especially Chris' talented pipes really make this an excellent album apart from his former band. He really is one of the best singers in rock, ever, and that fact really stands out solidly here."
1,Wow... this is one awful CD,"I was hoping to be blown away by Mr. Cornell's cannon of a voice, but instead found myself falling asleep to uninspired lyrics and down right awful music. All you have to do is look at the pictures of Chris in the booklet to realize this Knight of the Soundtable has lost his way. Avoid this one like the plague."
1,best of his solo efforts and that's not saying much,This is the best Cornell solo effort and thats not saying a lot. Try out his AudioSlave or Soundgarden stuff it's amazing but this is bland and soulless like his Scream album.
1,How can anyone take this seriously?,"Lyrically, Cornell sounds like a sub-literate 14 year old scribbling deep thoughts in a spiral notebook: hideous. And the music sounds like it was lifted from a bunch of mid 70s Foreigner out-takes: bland, canned guitar rock. So he's got a big-time voice? So what? I can't believe people like this dreck."
2,Cornell shines in Euphoria Morning,"Now you see why Soundgarden really broke up. Cornells' music was going in a different direction from the band. After a long wait, the front man of Soundgarden has realeased a good album, and promptly thanks his Soundgarden family many times. Euphoria Morning is best when played all the way through, and is a great pick up for all Soundgarden fans. The one possible draw back is the ommison of the single Sunshower, from the Great Expectation soundtrack."
2,Euphoria Morning Glory,"One of the best CD's I have ever heard! Chris is so unique with his singing and compositions, you'll just be amazed, especially if you're playing guitar like I do.I can't wait until his next album..."
2,Awesome CD,"This was a great solo debut for Chris Cornell. I still cant believe that people are comparing it to Soundgarden, though. IT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE SOUNDGARDEN. Somebody actually started bashing it because it wasnt like Badmotorfinger. There was noticable change from Screaming Life and FOPP to Badmotorfinger, then change from there to Superunknown, and then further change to Down on the Upside. Why in the heck would you think this album would sound like Badmotorfinger. I love the growth his music has taken. Great Job."
2,"oh honey, it's been so long.","Oh, Chris, darling. It's been too long. It is so good to hear your lovely, chills-inspiring voice again. The music, the voice, the background singers...oh how they make me realize how much I've missed you. It's better than gospel. It's Chris."
2,Chris Evolves With Spectacular Results,"I was a moderate Soundgarden fan, swept up in the power and bombast of the Seattle sound as a young twenty something when Superunknown came out.This, however, is a bold, unexpected, and 100% satisfying departure from that style. The songwriting is varied, crafty and melodic, reminiscient of the Beatles and (and I know this is blashemous) early, early Billy Joel. There isn't a power chord on the whole record, and yet it's still powerful and emotionally charged. It, for lack of a headier word, rocks. A velvet-wrapped sledgehammer.The arrangements are off-kilter and not so radio-friendly. But the songs are irresistable. And the singing is...damn! can that man sing. Thirteen Bucks well spent."
2,Really Good Album that doesn't rip-off Cornell's past...,"This is a really good album that manages not too sound like Soundgarden. In fact, if your looking for that, you might as well go play ""Superunknown"" a few more times. Cornell rarely moves into his ""grunge"" wail, and instead keeps everything less visceral than his former bandmates. Very Beatle-y circa '67. Solid musicianship and great lyrics, too. Cornell is a long-term player whether Soundgarden fans like this or not."
1,will not work,"I have a high end sony blu-ray player, and for some reason this is the only blu-ray that will not play at all and yes I have a network conection. This blu-ray has no scraches either."
2,The Longest Day,"A wonderful classic, war movie. They don't make movies like this anymore nor do they have great actors like those in this movie. This is why I buy the older movies. Most remakes are horrid and the actors are worse."
1,gkardd,Don't waste your $ - it wasn't worth buying the blu-ray version. I should have rented the dvd first before spending the blu-ray version.
2,Water Conditioner,"This product has been excellent for dosing when performing water changes. Subsequent to its use we have found that our corals ""bloom"" as full as possible and appear to be at their healthiest. Even thought we produce R/O water using a high end filter with four cartridges including resin and deionization, adding this product to the R/O water when performing water changes seems to improve water quality.Also, when I look at my tank and see my corals are not looking as healthy as I would like, adding this product at the recommended doses produces immediate results and within ten minutes we see a substantial improvement in the look of our corals."
2,what a voice,It's old fashioned and has the fun sweetness of something we no longer have as much......innocence.
1,Bad.,"Although I usually enjoy Ashanti's music, I'd have to say her single ""Happy"" holds a spot as one of her worst songs. It has a slow boring beat and airy, echoing vocals. It samples Gap Band's ""Outstanding"", but oh well, what do you expect? Also, this single also includes ""Call"", her album's WORST track. Please, for your own good, skip this."
2,"Interesting, atmospheric mystery debut","Hollywood, 1941. Screenwriter Keith Moody is about to hit the big time with the dramatization of his cousin's heroic war exploits. Greg Matthew's first mystery is a chronicle of Moody's experience, chock full of quirky humor, nasty characters and implausable plot twists. Its satirical depiction of the movie biz, our weak but willing hero's Faustian dilemma, and a unique love interest are presented in a narrative that soars above the messy plot, creating a portrait of a corrupt and totally fascinating world, as Far From Heaven as possible. Weird and wonderful--I LOVED it"
2,Good Sci-Fi flick!,"Although I might not go into great detail, I just want to say- I rented this movie, but wish I had it on dvd (my own collection) I thought the storyline was decent and had a surprise or two in it. I like the last person on Earth subject (scary-to say the least) I would say, if you arent sure you want to buy it---its as simple to just rent it. I am glad I took the time to watch it!"
2,Quiet Earth and Quiet Film,"I liked the quietness of the film and the simple idea behind the premise of the sci-fi story. It's neat to know that Kiwis seem to have a sense of humor even if they were the last people on Earth and take things somewhat in stride. So this film is a little different and underdramatic but has a neat perspective.What I couldn't get over were the ghastley clothes from the 80s. Strange, I know. Three people are the le last o exist on the Earth and I worry about their attire.A film that's different and low key but well acted."
2,The Quiet Earth,"Great movie that arrived in perfect condition and played perfectly as well. I would recommend purchasing for this seller at any time.Cheers,Scott"
1,The Quiet Earth,"Waking up and finding himself alone, with no explanation then, finding out it was his own research companies fault, then finding and falling for the only ...fortunatley YOUNG girl in New Zealand, then finding another bloke, a big young Maori, she changes horses. Being the only 3 alive they sort of stay friends. All very odd, Anyway, the original bloke works out the Apoclypse is going to happen again, But finding out they were alive because they all were in the process of dying, the previous time, they decide to try and kill themselves again, but how, when, where (yawn: why ?) so very drawn out about nothing much."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money Like I Did.,"I hated it. I watched it the day I got from Amazon (great service-no fault there) and threw it in the garbage after a lame viewing. My first clue should have been the ""winner of 8 New Zealand Academy Awards"" banner. As with most PC movies this one involves, as it's climax, inter-racial sex between a red head and a native New Zealander. If you're not into that sort of thing, don't buy it. This has little to do with ""end of the world"" type action, and more of ""Panic in year Zero meets Jungle Fever"" type crap. Save your money."
2,Leisurely read,"I liked the book Inspector Iminishi Investigates, a leisurely story that is buttressed by the Japanese setting. A large part of my satisfaction was the authentic seeming police procedural. I believe that a Japanese police force would work in this way as opposed to the 48 hours mentality of police in our country,i.e. most crimes are solved in the first 48 hours.I was able to put the book down and would go back to it which is pretty much how I judge a book. Some I can't put down at all hence the 4 stars."
2,Selleck Continues as the Modern John Wayne,"Tom Selleck is one of two current western actors who continue the realism of the ""old west"" western actors in the mold of John Wayne and others. Westerns in todays age are an ""acquired taste"". Selleck is a natural and in this tale he continues his best efforts as he did in the Sacketts, Quigley Down Under, and the other great Westerns he's excelled in. The story has a character of realism like all the Louis Lamour classics and Selleck portrays the hero in respect to the writers intent to picture the real Old West. Virginia Madsen is an unusual selection for the heroine, but she carries off the role and doesn't detract from the plot. Wilford Brimley again demonstrates his dynamic talents as a great character actor - an unusual role for him but he adds credibility to the plot. And Mark Harmon gives honest credibility to the villian's role of all great westerns. For the Westerns movie buff, another Selleck success is a great addition to one's collection."
2,Powerful and efficient,This product is more durable and powerful than the B&D version. It has one housing with battery with inter-changeable blades where the B&D is two seperate houseings with non-inter-changeable blades. I have had this company's grass shears before and would definitely buy this brand again.
1,powerless cutter,I purchased this grass cutter to trim a small area around my sons grave which takes about five minutes. when I first received this item it worked fine. Now after the battery is fully charged it does not last more than a minutes. I have wanted to return it because it has it has a lifetime guarantee please let me know how to get a replacement
1,poor life cycle - not a smart buy,"We bought this in 4/09 and gave it VERY moderate use. We have little trimming but the product looked like a good buy. Initial use was impressive with good battery life that was always kept recharged. it was never exposed to wet conditions and never used inappropriately.We did buy an extension handle that did not work because the plastic electrical connection was misaligned. We returned that one and asked for another, only to find the same misalignment, so we gave up on the handle idea.We have kept this equipment immaculately clean amd stored in moderate temps.Now (3/10) we have a dead battery that cannot be charged. The service / support has been turfed to a third party that is only interested in selling replacement parts.I'm unwilling to spend any more $$ on what appears to be a great idea gone very wrong.RECOMMENDATON: Don't buy. Look elsewhere."
1,Worth equal to toilet paper,"do you want a summary of this book?Stupid kid: ""Hey Mr. Manager, how about you teach me some managing stuff to manage people""Manager:""you want me to teach you some managing stuff to manage people with""?Stupid kid: ""yeah i want you to teach me some managing stuff, to manage people with""Manager: ""allright, ill teach you some managing stuff to manage people with""Stupid kid: ""you mean to tell me you'd teach me some managing stuff to manage people with""?Manager: ""i dont like repeating stuff, ill show you some managing stuff to manage people with""*repeat thought out the whole bookif you are in idiot and you think books like rich dad poor dad are good books, then prepare for a heart warming storyif not, dont waste your time like i did, this bs could have been written in a greeting card"
1,Not a big deal!,"Another business book from bestseller list. Does it really help your vision? I do not think so. It is simple, well written, easy to read book. But, I did not get anything from it. If you have really have time, go ahead and read it. By the way, it takes only 45 minutes to finish it."
2,Worth more than One Minute,"A little oversimplified and repetitive, but still a classic management book. Every leader should read this. Its concepts are so simple, and yet, there are so many managers in the world who remain ignorant of them! I wish every boss and senior colleague I have ever had, have, and will have would read this book."
2,For the real manager.,"This book is for the real manager who is looking for ways to improve efficiency, and just the overall attitude of a company or corporation.."
2,Clifford's First Valentine's Day Was Great!,Cliffords first Valentine's Day is a good book. It is best for kids the age of 4-6 because it uses small words. It is also easy for the children to comprehend. Clifford jumps into the mail cart and gets lost in the mail. I would recommend this book to any children interested in books. It is a good book.
2,Grandmas Bliss,I love all the books by Debbie Bliss. Lots of patterns and Ideas. If you love her yarn you will love the books too.
1,Cannot even compare to the book!,"Terrible, terrible, just terrible! Ms. Isaacs, how can you letthem do this to your marvelous book! The plot, the actors justbutchered it. And don't even mention that Melanie Griffith. Linda Voss is supposed to be this confident, working girl but instead she made her out to be this wimpy, whispery-voiced wishy-washy sort of girl. Okay here is my advice. If you want to enjoy this movie, see it first then read the book by Susan Isaacs. You should look it up on Amazon too and see how highly it is recommended. I read it first and the movie was an unmitigated failure and disappointment to me. I could just cry thinking about it. I really wish they would make another movie out of it, but this time do it right and just follow the book which is just too perfect and which one cannot go wrong in following. Okay enough talk, read the book, forget the movie."
2,The Shining,I'm a sucker for a wonderful love story and I love watching movies with history to it and it takes place when I was born.
2,"SPY, SUSPENSE, THRILLER, AND FABULOUS LOVE INTEREST","A love affair between an American spy and his secretary During WW2 is taken to Germany behind enemy lines when German scientists are suspected of developing a very destructive bomb. A Fabulous romantic love story with great actors, a fantastic background sceneries and great costumes. A very enjoyable movie.The quality of the DVD is good. One minus though, this DVD comes almost without any additional features."
1,Worst. Economics. Text. Ever.,"This really is the worst Economics textbook I have ever encountered. This 466-page soft cover text is absolutely miserable, both in terms of clarity and organization. In addition, many fundamental concepts are not present in the text - the author cites them as ""beyond the scope of this book."" The book even resorts to bad grammer and poor editing in places. The level of incompetence on the part of the text's author is truly astonishing."
2,Pretty Darn Good,"I normaly spend my time cringing at the writing of computer science authors. This book is fairly straight forward. It skips a beat here and there, but not so much that it stops one dead in the tracks. It is an exhaustive read and only on the basics. I thought that more depth is eventually needed when Cocoon gets finalized, but this is about as good as it gets right now."
1,Tuner Technology: Analog,This shows up under digital ... but if you look closer it reads ... Tuner Technology: Analog
1,Tasteless and pathetic,"A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!"
1,May I use your Umbrella?,"....those of you who have seen this movie will get my title. I think the Umbrella scene was just fantastic! In this sequel, we are following the path of the younger brother of the killer in the first movie. Which is a very good B movie, it was even picketed for it content..you know a movie is good if people wanna get rid of it. Anyways, so we have Eric Freeman playing the younger brother, haunted by flash backs from the first movie (which this movie has alot of flashbacks), he begins a rein of terror in a santa claus suit, as did his brother. all the b movie elements are evident here. bad acting, nudity, sex, killing, blood, etc. I recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the 1st one. The 3rd isn't bad either. Stop there. 4 and 5 have nothing to do with the first 3."
1,BAD MOVIE,"My friend and i were looking for a bad horror movie, and we found it. First of all, it was 50% the first film, which is strange because in our video store it's labled that you must be 18 to rent it and we're younger than that and we rented this one. The story is stupid. PLEASE! santa? The writhers of this must have been high or something when they wrote this."
1,Awful,"This book just isn't worth it. Whether one is or is not an Imus fan, he is a fascinating subject for a biography. But this book is basically a rehash of things that have been said or written elsewhere. It has a number of out-of-date references, has nothing but dated pictures from more than ten years ago, and has factually inaccuracies and misspellings. Sorry, but don't waste your time or money."
1,IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY,"This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true."
1,Huge problem with this book!,"There is one huge problem with the premise of this book and that is that MARY DOES NOT HAVE GRANDCHILDREN. She is ever-virgin and has only birthed Jesus, God's son. Jesus never married or had children, so how could Mary have a grandchild? When I see books like this that get past publishers (Christian ones, to boot!), I have to wonder where this world headed."
2,Most Relaxing,"My husband bought this CD for me many years ago...copyright date 1993. After 14 years of listening, I still find it to be one of the most calming, relaxing CD's I own. Listening to it (especially with earphones/surround sound) transports me out of a mood of stress-related irritability into a world of tranquility and relaxation."
1,The Digital Caliper Did not work!,I am very disatisfied! I purchased this as a Christmas present. We got a call 2 days later saying it did not work! I tried to contact Apex Tools and they never returned my calls! Now I am stuck with a product that does not work and that I cannot return because no one has returned my call!
2,Nice for the price,Really nice quality for the price. Nice case for storage and protection when not in use. Easy to use and the spare battery is a nice bonus.
2,Digital calipers,Good quality calipers with digital readout at a terrific price. Very useful measuring device for my wood shop.
2,Good Tool Low Price,This is a great tool! it is quite accurate for a low price. not much more to say
1,Worth what you pay for it - no more!,"If you think there's some magic and you're getting a precision digital caliper for $9, think again. This is a steel ruler that happens to have a digital readout. I guess the precision would be enough for some applications (e.g., wood carpentry) but I would not recommend it for precision mechanical or electronic applications. In particular, the depth gauge feeler on mine was slightly bowed and did not fit precisely in the guides for it, making accurate measurements with it impossible. Lesson learned, I'm coughing up $85"
2,Great condition,Another book with which I was very pleased with its condition. It also came in the time allowed for. I was very pleased.
2,Wonderful Period Piece,"Most of us know the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow - likely through Disney's well-crafted and true to the original adaptation of this Washington Irving classic, but it is worth the effort to explore the original. It is wonderfully written and contains a good deal of period language that has dropped out of our vernacular. The book is a quick read, with vibrant descriptions of colonial life in upstate New York.I recommend reading in the early fall, with a good scotch and a roaring fire."
1,I'm done with this show....,"I used to love this show, but it's just too ridiculous now. This season we've only watched so we could see how Ted meets the kids' mother.... But I just don't care any more.Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction? Barney's apartment is decorated like a Hello Kitty fanatic's place? How stupid.I haven't laughed with this show for a LONG time."
1,Please send me the product,"Many weeks ago I bought this product and it is not shiped yet, when you will send it to me?"
2,Having fun watching it,"I love it. the story is interesting, each character has his/her own personality. Unpredictable development of the story. i really enjoy it."
1,naked truth,I was not trying to buy this because I already bought the entire season. I just could not get it to play so I think I ended up paying again.
1,still waiting,"I think one have to be very passionated about the delivery time, even if I was warned for the late delivery.Now it takes ""TO"" long waiting. I'm afraid I never will receive this product. What about my payment I already did do long time ago. I only hope the Amazon seller ""KRUSHCO WRESTLING"" will not run away with my money without delivering."
2,Captured Live!!,"NRBQ have released a few live recordings but this one seems to capture the band's comraderie. They are having fun and so is the audience. Everything seems spontaneous yet well coordinated. They are a fun, cohesive band. This disc is a blast! I've worn out my cassette and am purchasing the CD!! Thanks Uncle Q!"
1,bad,i dont like to read books but i will read a book that gets my attention and when i started reading this book i hated it this book was very boring and uninteresting and just dull nothing interesting happened. the main girls sister had diabetes then shes hospitalized because she doesnt want to do what she has to then they get a new house guest who tells the girl about the pirate queen and the dad isnt around much in the book but thats not really anything interesting because the way it was written it just didnt get my attention at all.written by courtnee E.
1,Total Waste,This is one of the greatest wastes of talent I've seen in some time - and I've seen some stinkers. Why Caan and Powers accepted this script is beyond me but at least they survived its embarrassment and went on to much greater things. I can forgive a lot in a Western and can avoid the others but this one should just quietly be forgotten.
2,You need to give this one some time. Rewards will come.,"The first time I heard this I thought I'd finally found it. A truly unworthy Robert Pollard/GBV release. The first impression you'll get is ""where's the tunes, Bob?"". Songs begin with odd a capella chants, strange vocals and weird conversations. But after quite a few repeated listenings you will find what you love about Bob which is a truly masterful grasp of the joy of pop music. This time Bob has thrown us for a loop but songs like In the House of Charles Augustus, Red Ink Superman, and Harrison Adams finally shine through and give you ""that feeling"" you get when you discover a Bob gem."
2,The Offical All My Children Trivia Book,I bought this book because my FAVORITE show was taken off. It is a great collector book for people like me. It contained things that I had forgotten about even though I had watched the show for 40 years.
1,"Survival Island, should read, Sink me Island","Another hype movive that is so, lets keep it basic, stupid. one scene she takes off all her clothes and comes out with her bottoms on. and there are more of this camera work. it's just a bad movie."
1,Sucked,"You know those movies that make you feel sick and disgusted, and wish you didn't see the movie to begin with. Well, this is one of those movies. Man, those writers in Hollywood have no class or morals. I don't know what they paid Kelly Brook to do the movie, but I'm sure she realizes now it wasn't worth it."
2,5 Stars for Kelly Brook!,"If you like Kelly Brook the British bombshell you should see this movie! Kelly is hot running around the island in a white bikini. There are also some nude scenes and Kelly shows off her perfect legs, ample mellons and her perfect shape. After she washes ashore on the island we see her laying on her tummy in the sand until she regains her strength. The camera hovers on her butt for a bit. Thank you! She has the perfect bottom. Also lots of skinny dip scenes with Kelly topless and less. She gets attacked by the sailor and this scene goes completely nude. There is a surprise twist to this scene.Kelly Brook fans will enjoy this movie!"
1,Really?,"So, who wrote this, because it had to be a man. Of course, women could never survive without a man, could they? And wouldn't they just do the silliest possible things imaginable? Treat each other terribly? Or run around with flowers in their hair and dance all day? Not one of them would be able to grow their own food, and for sure - they would absolutely drug and abuse any other women out of what? jealousy? Oh please. The only good part of this is the end where the only man alive after the rain is GAY!This is just awful, not campy. It belittles women in every possible way. Save your money."
1,useless product,"when i first received the product, it worked ok. my grandaughter who is almost 5 and wiegh 40 pounds, bent both rods an now it is broke and usless"
2,Satisfied,"Other than one of the two screws needed to install this product was missing, I have no issues. The problem was in packaging, as a small crinkled piece of tape was used to stick the loose screws to the back of the plastic crusher. Then the shipping box had cracks in it, so the screw apparently came loose and fell out during shipping. Missing hardware seems to be the norm these days no matter where you purchase products. So far the crusher works great. Time will tell as it is made of plastic, but seems to be sturdy."
2,small but mighty,"great product if you only use 12 oz cans; had a party, bought 16oz cans and had to smash them all by hand, they won't fit unless you bend them a bit at the top by yourself and then you have to hold them in place and try to smash, not very productive. otherwise, great"
2,Best Can Crusher,"I can't believe I have been crushing and recycling cans for 30 years and have been wasting my time with other crushers. I just installed the Easy Pull crusher and got to work crushing the cans that have backed up since my old crusher died and all I can say is Wow! Easy Pull is hands down the best can crusher I have ever used, none of the others even come close! I know this unit costs three times what my old one did but it is worth every penny. One more nice thing about it: because it is made mostly of plastic (nylon) it is much quieter that other crushers (just an added bonus)."
1,Junk!!,This thing is JUNK! After crushing only 4....yes 4 cans it snapped in two. Way over priced for the quality. It's nothing but plastic. I would recommend spending a lot less on a different product...which will probably quarantee at least more than 4 total cans crushed over the life of the product.
1,No caller ID,As the last review says - I too did not realize this model does not have caller ID. Sellers should state this specifically. Very disappointed as well. Wish I had seen the previous complaint before purchasing.
1,Cats had fleas within a month,"Both cats were infested with fleas, the worse they have ever had within a month of using these collars, and both my cats are indoor only cats. I was very disappointed."
2,Space Invaders,Space Invaders rocks!!! The cool 3-D graphics are so cool! I have it for Game Boy Advance SP. I got all the way through the game and won!!! It is a great game to play!
2,Just Plain Fun,"Sure the graphics aren't stunning but for some unexplicable reason this game is just plain fun, I haven't yet treid out multiplayer but I know that the regular game is really fun!"
1,The only book that I actually wish to never even see again.,"The first time I tried to read this and failed I assumed that maybe I was distracted and would try again later. The second time I convinced myself that I had too many books on the go at the one time. The third time I told myself that I was too busy to give it the time it deserved. Frankly, I have now learnt that if you need to try for the fourth time to read something and have to force yourself to keep turning the page it is a bad sign.This is frankly the only book that I have purchased that I not only don't want anymore - but I don't want to inflict it on anyone else by giving it to charity. The story was woeful. The characters are impossible to like or in any way relate to. This is my quiet warning. If you are simply looking for a good read you are wasting your time here."
2,Tender,"One of the most tender and true to the heart works by E.M. Forster, teenagers as well as adults will find this classic one that will keep them up all night. The gentle love of young middle classed Emerson for the wealthy Lucy his only heightened when his uncontrollable love for her fluctuates. He doesn't know how to tell her!!! And when he does try to tell her, he only shocks and suspends her. Fantastic!"
1,"Blurry, Faded, and Flat","This print arrived today; as soon as I unrolled it I realized I had made a mistake with this purchase. The quality is worse than if I had printed it on ""fast draft"" on my inkjet printer. The colors are incredibly under saturated, the contrast is extremely low, and the details are blurry.The original work is dark, and bright, with every shade of red and gold and grey. This is predominantly beige and brownish-orange. I never expected them to be able to replicate the actual metallic paint in the ""5"" in the center, but the colors of this whole print are way off.Furthermore, the entire painting is not on this print- about an inch all the way around is missing- in the original painting, on the right hand side, the window says ""...ART CO."" however this print has the ""CO."" cut off.This print is going in the trash."
1,I would rather scrape,"I dont care for this item. I would rather scrape the windshield off. The elastic is to short to hook onto anything. I bought two and they are going in with our rummage sale items, to be sold or given away."
2,GREAT PRODUCT.,the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for 10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
2,There is no better Physics text for the non-Ph.D. reader.,"This excellent series of texts covers almost every topic in modern physics. This is the only book on Physics that covers all this complex physics topics that could be understood by anyone with a college degree. However, for those without background in Calculus, you may have some trouble."
1,The lame observations of an unfunny man.,"I'll keep this short since I've already wasted enough time reading this garbage. Chuck Klosterman presents his limited view on a number of uninteresting topics. He presents his humorless observations as if they have some bearing in absolute truth, when they are just solely his poorly thought out perceptions. The only reason one would purchase a book such as this is to get a laugh. However, there isn't a single funny line in this entire book."
1,Can you say boring three times fast?,"Oh, how I wanted to love this book. I love books about nothing, especially when people write about nothing very well. Nothing can be really amusing, and nothing is the perfect prelude to sleep. This book, however, almost induced a coma with all of its pretentious stupidity and references to Pamela Anderson and various serial killers. While the effort to be Deep and Outrageously Funny shown through like a 5000 watt lightbulb, the actual result amounted to one of the most mind-numbing and tedious expositions on Nothing that I have read in a long time. (Read at your own risk.)"
2,clever,"I liked this book. I can't say I loved it (hence, the 4 stars), but I really liked it. Crafty, clever, and every bit of life should have a soundtrack.He knows his pop culture and he has a way of reminding you of what you thought you knew but had 'mis'-forgotten. Clever material ranging from Zach Morris to Pam Anderson to Billy Joel. A quick read and the kind of read that actually provides interesting resources for how to look at what only appears to be the benign things that constitute this culture. Good stuff."
1,you're better off reading cocoa puff box.,"This book is a complete waste of time. I can't imagine how anyone could get an ounce of entertainment or enlightenment from this book.The one part that sticks out is the short essay on probabilities. The author says that there's only one probability in life: 50/50, everything is either going to happen or not. So the odds of winning the lottery: 50/50. I assume that if you are capable of reading this review that you understand this is blatantly false.Maybe I should start writing books. Here's my first essay: we don't need weathermen. The weather tomorrow is either going to be hotter or colder than it was today. Three days from now it will either rain or not. I'm sure if I stretched that theory out, added some flowery language, and gave it a catchy title the new yorker would tell all their readers that they need to like my book."
1,Limited Coverage,I agree with the other comments about the coverage only being for large metro areas or POI such as Grand Canyon or Wine Country. For intermittent information between large cities it nothing.Really not worth $50. get an AAA book
1,Rip-off!,"Garmin and Fodors should be ashamed of this product. The coverage is absurd. In Washington D.C. I looked for a restaurant near my current location. Nada, but I was surrounded by a wide variety of places to eat, some of them very highly rated by local media. This guide wanted me to go most of the way across town, an expensive cab ride, to a neighborhood that I was advised wasn't very safe. You're better off to Google the city before you visit and take along a few pages of printouts. Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage."
1,Hampered by use of custom libraries,"Being an O'Reilly fan it is hard for me to find fault with their no-nonsense approach to technical books, but there is one MAJOR issue I have with this book.As a developer for a major corporation I cannot use custom libraries for my work, especially when the license (http://www.servlets.com/cos/license.html) does not allow for commercial use. Where it would be helpful to see details on creating say, a multipart request class, Bruce Perry instead uses the com.oreilly.servlet.MultipartRequest class to hide much of the functionality (this is just one example).This makes little or no sense. Developers in the real world need real examples. Hiding the implementation of such under the non-commercial license pretty much ruins much of the potential application of an otherwise well written book. If you buy this book realise that only some of it will actually be useful in the real world."
2,'The Engager' - works good,Our company had some trailers that had dead batteries in the 'break-away' systems. Instead of just replacing batteries - (which were quite expensive) I decided to replace the whole system. Found the 'Hopkins Engager' at Amazon. It was cheaper than a battery for our existing systems and came with a switch and everything else new. It was easy to install and it works good. I really like the battery meter that tells if your charge circuit is working on the pull vehicle. Good product
2,Prior Reviews Are Not of This Set,I have not heard all of this set yet. I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great. The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music. None of the reviews are of this set. All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.More later.
1,Terrible quality control.,"The Charge TTi that I received was stuck on one side so the bottle opener and screwdriver would not open or lock correctly. I understand that titanium can be difficult to work with, but something like this should have never made it past quality control. A defect like this is totally unacceptable, especially on a Leatherman that costs over $100. I am very disappointed and will be returning this tool immediately."
2,Perfect Tool!,"This product is really nice. I love how light weight it is, yet so incredibly durable. Leatherman is a great company and I have to say, to this day, I have not had a bad product. One thing I Like better than my surge is the scissors both have scissors but i like that the Charge is spring assisted just smoother cutting. Perfect tool."
1,Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.,I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
2,"Founding ""god"" father",This streamlined synopsis of the teachings of Jesus Christ is drawn from the gospels of the bible without any religious dogma. The parables Jesus spoke are compiled nicely and provided me with the life lessons which I attempt to live by.
2,Piece of American History,"This bargain is an impoprtant piece of American history. Jefferson was a diest, which they viewed God as like a fine clock maker and made the government intself, not the constitution. They got rid of anything supernatural from the Bible. It stands along side the King James Bible and the 1611 edition of the King James, the works of Martin Luther as one of the most important reads for a Christian in American history. I liked it a lot, but it's too skimpy a volume to be a classic, but it is famous."
2,Wolf Woman is the best book I have ever read,"Wolf Woman is an exciting story I read. It was about a girl called Wolf-Woman by the clan.Tanith is meant to be part of a family but is treated like an outsider. Then this man, Gibran, has come to say he loves Tanith.``We chose each other, the wolves and I,though our first meeting is so far back in my life that it is lost in the shades of memory.''This is the most exciting part!I think all teenagers should read this book if they like a good book about not fitting with people in with but fitting in well with animals."
1,Borrrrrring,"I heard about the game on TV & thought it looked like sooooo much fun, was I wrong, oh yes!!! Theres only a few things todo, make mixes (that turn out really bad), dance(or press falling buttons as they fall) and pick out clothe(the best part of the game!) I mean the graphics r good & I still like Mary-Kate & Ashley, but there's no point to the game really!"
2,erinsmom,"Love this diaper bag-the only negative thing about it is that I tend to ""over fill"" my diaper bag, and when you do this, it makes it difficult for the magnet closure to work. But overall, it is great!"
2,Not Much Room,"I like the bag. It's stylish, gender friendly, and easy on my shoulder! I really like that when I take my son to daycare, he's the only one with this bag! My only complaint is that there is not much room when traveling. When on the road for an hour and a half, two hours, I need to pack extra things and just not too much room for those things. So, I end up taking my old bag."
2,"Hillman is authoritative, erudite and comprehensive.","James Hillman's book Kinds of Power, srikes a chord of resonance at every root ""chakra"" in the human body. Two dozen associates under the rubric of ""power"" are brought to bear upon the reader. Hillman appears to ""make up"" his analysis as he goes along, but, with his intellect and breadth of pedantic knowledge, he stays a steady course from start to finish. Hillman is convincing, forever analytical and sufficiently critical. He does have a way of getting off the path at times and entertains his way through some tough issues by employing a bit of sophism. Nonetheless, overall, a book well worth reading."
2,"Way to go, Jackie!","This is one game that was a long time in the making, and like his movies, it is full of action. What I like about it is it doesn't try to confuse you with all of the motions you can do by pressing 10 million buttons. The plot of the game (Jackie loses package to gang) actually sounds like a plot for one of his movies. Also JC providing his moves and his voice to the game is a real plus. He is one of the most respected moviemakers, and this game shows it. For one thing, it is not excessively violent. Anyone can play. JC sets a good example to kids with that and he is definately a role model in my book. Way to go, Jackie!"
1,disappointed,this item did nothing to educate nor inform the audience of the artist Vincent VanGogh as a person nor his work
2,a bomb ... streetball title for your ps2,"When I first purchased this game, I was a little skeptical about its play value. I had heard very mixed reviews and I just wanted to see what the games was like for myself. It turns out I made the right choice. This game has a solid street ""feel"" to it and all the secrets are a nice touch. I mean hey, who wouldn't want to see celebrities and real life ballers shakin' each other up and putting shame on each other. But, every game has its drawbacks. The create-a-baller system and the camera angles are just awful. This definitely needs to be worked on to keep its gamers hooked. The music was good, but gets very repetitive, its much better to just put the music on mute and just play your faorite pump up music. But, still a good game nonetheless."
2,STREET HOOPS,"STREET HOOPS IS THE BEST BASKETBALL/AND1 GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.IT IS SO TIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY GAME MODES LIKE ;KING OF THE COURT,LORD OF COURT,HALF-COURT PICK-UP,AN LAST FULL-COURT PICK-UP.WHEN YOU EARN ALOT OF MONEY YOU CAN GO TO THE STORES SUCH AS;FOOTACTION,THE BARBER SHOP,THE TATOO SHOP,AND THE BET PLACE.THERE ARE OHTER REASONS I LIKE THIS GAME,BUT I HAVE TO GO .SO MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS GAME."
2,This book speaks to the heart of life,I can truly say this book made me come to grips with the focus of my life. I have so struggled to make sense of my time on earth and have I made a difference. Such an important quest comes full circle after reading what happens when all hope is removed. I have given a copy of this book to both my sons. I want them to be fulfilled men.
2,Hope in Suffering,"Viktor Emil Frankl, eminent psychiatrist and founder of logotherapy passed away on September 1997.A sadness swept through me as I heard of his death. ""Man's Search for Meaning"" was the very first book of his that I read, and along with many others who have read this best-seller I have been comforted with his simple but sagely advise: ""[E]ven the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.""Dr. Frankl shall be remembered as one who gave humanity the courage to go through life's tumult and to endure suffering with dignity."
2,Search for Meaning,"At times this book can be a little dry, but when you look at the book as a whole its a amazing book.The book in part one covers Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp. This part forms the base of the ideas of logothearpy. It's a great story and very interesting to see how person takes to such a horrible event.Second part of the book is on his theory of logothearpy. Very interesting idealogy. Covers some cases in it. The basic idea being that each person creates his own reality and meaning, whatever meaning a person finds in his/her life is the right one.third part is a update taken from a lecture he gave. Goes over some of the same material in part II and expands on it.Great book, worth the day or two it takes to read."
2,Interesting,This book is more than a simple retelling of what happened in the concentration camps. It examines our behavior in times of extreme stress.
2,A path from apathy...,"From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the ""existential vacuum"", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life. This book will change you."
2,Get a hard copy,"If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you. If you need a change in perspective this is a book for you. If you feel like a victim, this is the book for you. If you are in recovery for PTSD, Substance abuse, or just plain flat in life, this is a book for you."
2,Very meaningful read,This was a very compelling book to read. I couldnt keep it down till I finished the whole book. The reader will definitely be able to relate himself or herself to the real life examples mentioned in this book. This book gives one the revelation that the difficulties or challenges one faces in life are definitely far more better than the concentration camp experiences of the author and it gives one the confidence to face and overcome any situation successfully in life provided one has found the true meaning of his life. A must read book for all!
2,Inspiring,I read it for inspiration as much as for wisdom. It is hard to image the horrors he must have faced in the concentration camps and the loss of his family. The fact he could come out of it with such vision and ability to inspire and help others is amazing.
2,A book that can help you lifelong,"This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is ""man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose"". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens."
2,A MUST Read!,"This is life-changer upon one's mindset for facing the trials in life. A truly awesome book. I first received this book as a gift and when I saw the title I knew that this was a book that I would never have bought for myself because of the title ""Man's Search for Meaning"". Because as a Christian I understand the meaning of life. But this book deepened my understanding of adversity and I found it to be of great value. I then ordered two more books; each for 2 men serving life in prison and I hope this turns their despair to joy."
2,A Must Read,This is a book everyone needs to read at least one or more times.Viktor Frankl has given us invaluabletools for living. His experience hasbrought Logotherapy into being.He gives hope a whole new meaning.
2,Best PS2 Motorcycle Game.,"This is the best PS2 bike game available. It isn't perfect, the soundtrack is lacking and the graphics are nothing special. I do however enjoy the physics modelling and gameplay. If you brake while leaned over in a curve the bike will tend to stand up/run wide (very much like my own road going sport bike). The arcade modes are probably too hard for most but the career mode (Riding Spirit) is tonnes of fun. Now if they could spruce up the graphics, add some online play, and improve the soundtrack..."
2,Sundrinker by Zach Hughes,A great page turner!! Over much too soon!! This one is heartly recommended and most readers will simply devour it!!
2,"Money, Murder and a Dachshund! What more could you ask for?!","I really liked this movie! Yes, it is a bit silly, but it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy! Plus, it is set in Monte Carlo with (the late)John Candy and a Dachshund! I also liked the music, and George Hamilton is a spanish gigolo playboy with a great tan. Also, the several sub-plots, especially with Cybil Sheppard, I thought was played very well. Oh, yes, don't forget the murder of the unseen Dachshund owner! Overall I really enjoyed it and have seen it several times."
1,Fails at its basic purpose Try another brand,"These type of toys are supposed to slide out of your hands when you grab them. However this one has a very large (about 1/2 inch) seam where the two pieces are fitted together. That seam has also shrunk so is not only is much thicker in that area than the rest of the toy but also smaller. You can sort of see the seam in the pictures (look for the smaller part). The result is the toy only slips until it hits the seam and given the resistance the seams causes, even does that poorly. I have had other brands of this toy and never noticed a seam and they work quite well (are very hard to hold), but this one is pretty much worthless. It can easily be picked up and needs to be forced to slide in your hand. I strongly recommend you try one made by another company.Reading the other reviews, several of the 5 star ones seem a little too enthusiastic and I would not believe them to be genuine."
2,Yeah for Little Bear!,"Once again Little Bear and his adorable, loveable friends have proven that good wholesome cartoons are out there! My 3 yr old adores these movies. My older children watched when on Nickelodeon...so happy I found them for my newest addition. Would recommend to anyone who is unsure of what their children should be watching."
2,bear flick,very sweet. keeps our three year old entertained for a while. little bear has always been a favorite in our family.
1,Books review.,"Paper material is bad, pale print with only black and white including charts and graphics, bad glue is used to stick up the papers, book started do dismantle after very short period.However the learning material within is very useful and mandatory for some courses."
1,Could have been way more fabulous,"The trick is simple: Take a smash tv series, handpick a bunch of popular songs and blend them and record them on a CD. Send it to the retailers, promote endlessly on the aforementioned show and wait for the sales to hit the sky. What? That this CD never went to the top of the charts? Hmmm, wonder why.... Maybe because the tunes can be found in previously released albums? Or because the remixes were not remotely as good as expected? Or maybe because the good-for-all-taste compilation didn't quite work? Whatever the reason was, this is anything but a fabulous soundtrack. And it is sad for me to admit it, being a follower of the Fab Five escapades. Kylie, Junior Senior and Fischerpooner sound odd paired to the likes of Jamelia (!) and Ingrid(!!!)A chance to create a sort of groundbreaking work has been missed. Sign of times to come for the soon-to-be-old TV formula?"
2,"Good show, good soundtrack, however...","Love the show, and this soundtrack looks great. But buyer beware...the version of ""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"" is NOT the version you hear during the opening credits of the show. The version on this CD is the newer remixed version which has been featured on the video to the song. IMO the original version (during the opening credits) was far superior and far more catchy. This new remixed version sounds like, well, a remixed version. So be aware of this before buying the CD. But that's all the bad things I can say about it. The rest of the album is great.P.S. If anyone knows where one can find the original version of ""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"" (if it even exists on CD) please let me know. Thanks."
1,From Fab 5 to Drab 13,"One of the best parts about the show ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" has to be the music - bouncy, upbeat and extremely danceable. So when the soundtrack finally came out I eagerly snapped it up. What a disappointment! Aside from an edgier version of the main theme (""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"") none of the music that was heard on the show was on it. It looked like Capitol Records chose these 13 songs without an ounce of thought into it.After listening to it once, I ended up trading it in at one of those ""We Pay Cash For Your Used CD's"" stores. Hopefully the next ""Queer Eye For The Straight Guy"" soundtrack will be a little more truthful and have music from the actual show (including the original version of ""All Things Just Keep Getting Better"") and not from (for the most part) musical performers on the Capitol label who need a career boost."
2,Good for working out,"Good work-out mix but I could have done without two of the songs on this CD. Otherwise, I enjoyed it."
2,Except for the theme song no biggie,CD in perfect condition. I was hoping the other songs were as good as the theme song. Would perchase only if really into the background songs used on the show.
1,Not as good as the rest,"My main problem with this book is that it takes Saul's POV the entire time, and to be honest, his need to contradict himself all the time just annoys the heck out of me and takes up too much space. I'm surprised Saul has a guardian angel at all actually. Narlh is the best reason to keep reading. And how stupid is Saul to never realize that Matt is the Lord Wizard of Merovence despite being told that at least 5 times in 3 days??? That one fact alone nearly made me stop altogether, till I realized Matt had to show up sooner or later so I kept on."
2,oh yeah,"this is one of those albums with atmosphere. listen to the whole thing through, you can hear oscar peterson's fingers fingers muscling the keys, hear the talking, the glasses, the musicians communicating among themselves. really great jazz piano. this moves, it's alive!"
1,okay game,this game [disappoints]i thought this would be a good game but the graphics [disappoint]and the camera views are awful
1,What?,I am very glad I rented this first. I thought it would be good...judging by the good rating. But this game is BY FAR the worst game cube game I've played.
2,Jim Croce Classic Hits,"I received this CD as a gift for my birthday as I had heard it at a friend's house. The music is soothing, funny, thought provoking and melodc. Great buy."
1,"WHY this single on BILLBOARD HOT 100 top 10, IF NOT...","Sometime I bought singles or albums depend on billboard hot chart. I bought this sigle when it hit to billboard top 10, I even hadn't heard this song once. I listen this song first ime ,just remind me ""LAST NIGHT A DJ SAVED MY LIFE"" by MARIAH in GLITTER. And J-LO's vocal just like JANET singing ""ALL FOR YOU"" or MARIAH singing ""DON'T STOP(FUNKIN' 4 JAMAICA). l have too many like ""JENNY FORM THE BLOCK"" music product. IF this single had'nt hit to top 10, I can save the $$$."
2,Audubon Guide to African Wildlife,Excellent book with awesome color pictures and good concise narrative on each species and subspecies. It was very easy to identify all the various animals (large and small) and birds when on safari in Tanzania. Highly recommend .
2,"If you Love textile art, you'll love this book","I realize few people are aware of this excellent book - and that's a shame! It's in few libraries and available very reasonably priced, hard cover or soft cover. I own hundreds of creative textile books and this is in the top 10. It's outstanding. If you find one, buy it - you'll love it."
1,Disappointing,After reading Soulmates Dissipate I couldn't wait for Ms. Morrison's next novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Jada and Wellington. When I saw that they were in Never Again Once More I couldn't wait to begin the book. How could I have known that I would be in for a rude awakening. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline moved too fast and I really wasn't that fond of jada by the end of the book. I don't think Ms. Morrison should have gone as far as 20 years into the future.
2,Very old.,"The original build fest game imo, after red alert (which is also an excellent game). Wait for cossacks 2, being released next year.If you must indulge yourself, the online community is still reasonably strong, with many foreign players making up the majority of people there."
1,There are much better games out there,"I recieved this game with several others. The graphics might have been good in 2003, but they are laughable in late 2005.In all fairness, I can't speak to many of this games features because I only played for about an hour, but I won't be going back to this game any time soon."
2,An Excellent and Practical Guide To Grammar,"I first read and worked with this book on my own about 9 years ago and it really clarified grammar in a practical, ""real life"" way for me.It has helped me both as a writer and a reader.As a writer I found more options for expressing myself by having more tools to work with and as a reader it helps me decipher endlessly complex sentences that can resemble a linguistic maze.By being able to break down those complex sentences to their basic constituents, one can clearly see which parts of the sentence are functioning as core ideas, and which are functioning as embellishment.This book is very user friendly and is in my opinion an excellent self study guide with an interesting variety of exercises.Highly recommended"
2,well done,"well written,by by a good mind.All-in-all, it makes me wonder why mankind took a step backwards since the 60's...and....raither the following generations to come will have such brain farts, as those have done who in the last few decades, in the name of LAW and ORDER(that has caused such disorder.Experimenting is how civilizeatoins progess.You can't expect progress when good minds are supressed and restricted.That would of been like telling Ben Franklin""Kites with keys on them are now against the law to take out into a lightning storm,and,could hurt you.So, if you risk hurting yourself, and take kite with keys out in the lightning storm: By law we will hurt you real bad,and those who love you, so you wont risk hurting yourself any more.(yes it is a backwards step) GOD HELP US!But deffinately enjoyable books to read."
1,Kimi is disgusting,"She is a little poser!!! Kimi is the most gross and irritating of the babies. Wearing that stupid little diaper, always so happy. She won't be so happy when I kick her between the legs. Also, those stupid little cowboy boots. She really sucks. I'd like to see her get really injurewd and cry. That shown her!!! The movie was good, but she stinks."
2,Brilliant Movie!,"This movie is great for the whole family ! I love it ! Its cute , and written very well . My daughter loves the music , she sings all the songs . 5 stars in my book !"
2,LOVE,SMARTEST IDEA EVER AMAZON!!! I HAVE BEEN HONESTLY WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO HAPPEN EXCEPT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY FULL SEASONS. I WANT A FULL SEASON OF RUGRATS!:)
2,Great Family Movie,I took my daughter to see this when it was in the movie theater and she loved it so much that I purchased it for her when it came out on VHS/DVD! This is a great movie for young & old! Great family fun & entertainment! Fans of the Rugrats will be cheering for more!If you want to purchase a movie for a child that is a fan of the Rugrats then this is your movie!
2,Wow...,This statue is an amazing piece. The level of detail and craftsmanship is top notch. I'm glad I was able to pick up this piece while it was still available. I'm kicking myself for missing out on the Skeletor statue that was available a couple years ago.
2,Mind and Finger Stimulation,"You not only learn how to type more words per minute, efficiently, it is fun while you are learning. It is positively addicting!"
2,A Great First CD,"Elliott Yamin's new CD is a great new summer release.His easy going, melodic melodies prove why he ended up on American Idol.This CD is perfect for long car rides with the top down this summer. Yamin's soulful and inspired sounds make life easier and less stressful.His selection of songs highlight his talent and his range as a artist. I particulary liked track 9. This song makes a great dancing tune and the whole CD just sparkles.I'm looking forward to his next so I can add it to my collections"
2,Just wonderful!!!,"It is so nice to listen to a cd without the usual AI overproducing touches. This is music to not only enjoy listen to but music that you feel!! The songs are so real and heartfelt and I am just enjoying this cd so much. I haven't felt this way about a cd in a long time. There is something for everybody. ballads, r&b;, and even some dance mixes.This album will become a classic for me....."
2,One Word: Amazing...,"I woke up at 7AM to go get this CD and it was worth being tired all day at work. Elliott's voice can bring a grown man to tears. There is not one bad song on this CD. I still wonder how Mr. Yamin did not win American Idol 5. He is the most talented person to come out of the competition. I highly recommend that you get this CD and buy copies for all of your friends. Look out world, here comes Elliott!*Songs that are on repeat:-Wait For You-One Word-You Are The One-I'm The Man-Trainwreck-A Song For You (Donny Hathaway would be proud)"
2,way to go Elliot!,Great cd. I listen to it all the time! Can't wait for his next one. I'm proud of you Elliot!
2,Elliott's AMAZING,"I love it. I have never bought an American Idol record before... I've heard the songs they HAD to put out and hated them. I thought Elliott was so good on American Idol that I thought, like many others, that he should have remained on the show (like Daughtry also should have) but, nonetheless, he was dropped. Much to my shock, while walking through a department store I recently heard a song I loved.. it was ""Wait for You"" by Elliott. I was floored. He sounds SOOOO wonderful. Now I'm one of his biggest fans. Trust me, his voice just doesn't disappoint. And he's so down-to-earth in interviews and when he sings on shows (like Good Morning America, etc) that you can't do anything but just adore him. It's a great album and I look forward to his future released with great anticipation."
1,Late,This book took forever to get. I didn't recieve it for a month! Emailed and recieved no responce.
1,A good approach but filled with errors.,"There are too many errors in this edition to recommend it to a beginner. Approximately 75 errors were encountered. For a second edition, it is surprising that these errors were not corrected. Otherwise, I think this book would have been a good introduction to the Russian language."
2,Fantastic,"My husband says this cd rates in his all time favorite top 5, which is saying alot because he has over 800 cds in his collection."
2,Where to find on DVD,"Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit. She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father. If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD, look for it under the titles Bride of Violence 1 & Bride of Violence 2. It has only been released full length on DVD in the Netherlands under the alternate title. Keep in mind that this is a region 2 DVD (PAL) and will only play on a region 2 dvd player or a multi-region dvd player. I got one here on amazon for less than $40."
1,This is the one,"to get if you don't really want to hear what Bird was all about but want to have something in your collection by him. That's what this record was designed to do, reach the larger white audience with no real interest in Jazz. 2 stars for Bird managing to make something at least palatable out of Hefti's obnoxious arrangements."
1,Couldn't Deal With The Strings...,"If you want to hear the real Charlie Parker, don't buy this Cd because the strings are too overwhelming, believe me. I bought it and took it back the same day. And got another one of his cd's instead. Only 1 star for this CD but it's not because of Charlie. I don't even think that Charlie Parker would've sincerely enjoyed this."
1,yeah ... right!,"Why are there two prats giving this 5 out of 5. They are so obviously joke reviews. This is an awful movie and the zombie scenes are shut with a low shutter speed, so they end up looking like jerky pop-videos.-Mike"
1,BORING REVEANGE GHOST MOVIE!,"i saw this movie on SCI-FI last night! this movie is supposedly a ""zombie"" flick! after watching the part were they come in i was like ""wait .. wait oh wait they aren't zombies their ghosts!""even killing scenes were AWFUL i swear this movie looks like if it were a MADE FOR TV movie or something! the ""killing"" scenes are quite laughable considering ALL the horror movies i have seen! but this movie is more of a family drama about a son who finally gets to meet his dad after so long and they both save each other!this whole movie should have just been an 1 hour instead of 2!you could sum up the whole flim in 1 hour cause is all their doing is driving in the dessert and encountering revenageful ghosts and only 3 of them surive!skip this movie and go for ""return of the living dead""!"
1,Surprisingly BORING.,"I'm a huge fan of all three of the guitarists featured here, but this documentary is just plain boring. It's kinda cool to see each musician play at first, but the longer the movie goes on, the more you realize there is no over-arching POINT to any of it. It's basically just one giant mash-up. It could have been a great movie if it just had something -- ANYTHING -- to say. Instead it just piddles away a couple of hours without making any kind of real impression."
2,if you enjoy music...get this,"very well produced...great musiciansif you enjoy the guitar or rock at all, you will like this"
2,Fantastic!!,Such a great experience watching three generations of Rock guitarists come together to share their stories an experiences.I hope other musicians and fans get an opportunity to view this. It's quite a testament to music and how it has a profound effect on musicians and music lovers alike!
2,Best guitar movie ever!,"I went in special search of this film on blu-ray, you need it in this format in order to get the film without the audio compression, that DVD has. also, if you get this film turn it WAY UP! Jack White steals the show in this film, but Jimmy Page, and the Edge give a solid rock 'n roll history lesson for the ages! this film is one that if you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon pull it out and turn it up!"
2,Innovative Gem,"A factual docudrama-like film. The visuals in this one are so cool, they'll stick in your mind for a long while. Lena Stolze is the young protagonist, who discovers many hidden secrets of her small German town and how their claims regarding their actions during WWII were as manufactured as her own facade"
2,I'm stunned there is no US DVD...great film,"Can it be that the only DVD edition of this is for non-US countries? I think this film is brilliant. From start to finish, it showed the impact that one person can have with determination. It is a film in my library I watch at least once a year. What a crime to not have a DVD edition!"
1,DO NOT BUY this published version,"I'm suggesting not buying this text, not because the content is poor, but rather the publisher has defaced its worth. They equations and examples have somehow become gibberish with random symbols, there is no way to read this text and comprehend it. Percy Bridgman however did do a great job presenting dimensional analysis and because the text is no longer copyrighted you can find it on Google books for free.[…]"
2,Retro gaming at its best.,"This is a wonderful collection of games from the creative heyday of the video game industry. These are bit-perfect ports of the original games; the Playstation is emulating the 1980-era hardware and the original game code is running on the emulator. All the original gameplay is there, including the bugs! Because some of the games, Tempest and Asteroid in particular, had touchy hardware, owning these games on CD is better than owning the coin-ops for most folks. If you grew up with these games, you will enjoy the blast of nostalgia you'll get from playing them again. Today's games have better graphics, but they are not better games!In this collection: Asteroids, Battlezone, Centipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest.Also included are short video interviews with the creators of Tempest, Battlezone and Centipede."
2,"VHS very good new , very nice seller , I recommend !!! Thank you","Cette VHS est un pre bonheur , quelle joie de retrouver GUY WILLIAMS et tous les autres excellents Acteurs pour 1 H 30 d'aventures . Merci Monsieur Disney !!!"
1,Not as good,"I rented this game and I am glad that I didn't buy it right away. The game is too complicated and there were tons of glitches and i hated it. Bottom line, dont buy it!"
2,The weakest of Jordan's series.,"I believe this book had only one purpose -- to be a seg-way into the next. But where is the next? This novel lacks the exciting conclusion that I've come to expect. It ended so ""wide open"" that a reader can't help being frustrated. I hope that Mr. Jordan is alive and well, and will soon give us the novel that is two years coming. His novels have been a source of great enjoyment for me and I miss having a new one to read."
1,That's it...,"After spending a lot of time with this series, I have finally given up on The Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan frustrates me. You spend more time reading about what the characters are thinking rather than actually getting any of the plot resolves. Furthermore, the story goes into POVs that really, REALLY don't need to be done.One would think that if you are this far in the series, you should have a broad knowledge of what's going on. But RJ does not think so. He goes on once again to describe every single city and enviroment again and again and again. I mean, how many times can you describe Tel'aran'rhiod?Sadly, I've given up and will no more force myself to finish these books. If you're looking for something fast-paced, something that will work your mind and not bore you with long descriptions about how some random hawk is flying around, then do not go any further."
1,Crown of Bores,"I really enjoyed the first three books of the Wheel of Time. In fact I thought they were excellent. Book 5 was horrible, but Lord of Chaos (book 6) was another fine installment. Then we come to book 7. Truly pathetic. Looking for the tight writing and engaging style of the previous books? Looking for some real plot development and character growth? Then don't look at this book. Nothing happens. That's right, in a 700+ page book, nothing happens! The story doesn't move forward. It is filler material, nothing more. Robert Jordan should have been embarrassed to have ever seen this monstrosity go to print. I can only hope that future installments recapture the quality of past ones."
2,Another great adition to the Wheel of time series...,"Some people will say this book is slow. Well it is only true for the slow minded. This book is an addition to the series in a more ""fill-in-the-blanks"" way. It is very good that he did it because sometimes you look back on a story and it just doesn't make any sense. -A very smart adition to the series."
1,To rest on one's laurals...,To rest on one's laurals is to write the later installments of the wheel of time series. I feel like I have been taken for a buggy ride... at my own expense. Stick to the earlier parts because they are something else.
2,I can go on with this forever,"Robert Jordan is maybe one of the best authors I have ever read. From the first book to the seventh and soon eighth everyone was a wonder in itself. These books are filled with evergoing suspence,new and original theories,great fun and jokes and multicultural blend full of schemes,color,personalities... And I can go on for another hour, but then again,I probably don't have enough space for the full deal. I don't know what I'd do without RJ and I hope-I pray-that WOT won't ever come to an end."
2,Very enjoyable,"Like the rest of the series. This book was gripping from the beginning to the end. Robert Jordon's Wheel of Time Seriers is the best I have read. It is more compelling than David Eddings ""The Belgariad"", and TOLKEN. p PLEASE keep up the writing and release the books a little quicker is possible"
1,the beginning of the end,"Indeed, this is the beginning of the end. Well, actually, no, the end began about two books ago in the series. The hope was, it would pick up again...it did not.Hey, in some ways this is the best one since the first two...because it's the shortest. But that's about the only good thing about it."
2,GGGGGRRRRREEEEEAAAAAATTTT,"Finally a series of books that takes the time and does it properly. My feeling when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings was that it all finished too soon. Leaps are made, things just fall into place, characters suddenly learn what it is they're meant to do. Not so with these books. The characters are slowly coming into their own. Slowly learning their abilities and shaping their course. Brilliant. If the story is slow then it's as it should be, frustrating. It just makes it more worth while at the end of the day."
1,ARRGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"At least I see that there are other readers as frustrated as I am. What started out as an epic, has become drawn out and almost painful to read. The last two books, which I bought in hard back so eager was I to continue the story, have left me feeling used. Is there an amount of books the publishers need Mr. Jordan to write? Mr. Jordan - go back to the first few books, reread them - enjoy them as much as I did and start writing properly again - let the story go on its own - stop holding it back. The series is losing fans - please restore my faith and bring me back."
2,Jordan is Awesome,This is by far the most gripping series of books I have ever read. I hope this series goes on FOREVER ! Kill off the Forsaken slowly....and bring back Moiraine-We miss her. I buy the hardback edition of each book and do not sleep until I have finished the book !! I have read these books over and over again....I love them
2,Should I or shouldn't I buy #7?,"I went through much of the reviews for book #7 and it's pretty split between the pros and cons.I'm almost done with #6, and cannot decide if #7 would be worth reading. Maybe skipping it and jumping to #8? Any opinions? As a whole, I give the series (#1 - #6) an 8. That's it"
2,The best fantasy series since Tolkien,"I waited a long time for this book, and when I finally got my hands on it, it proved to be worth waiting for. I can understand those who think that nothing happens, but personally I don't care. The world and characters of Jordan becomes more and more alive for each book he writes. CoS isn't best of the books i the series but I still think it's great"
2,music with soul,"i am sick and tired of reading all these reviews that diss g. love and his sound. music critics desparately try and pigeon-hole him into a category with little sucess. i have heard him compared to acts as varied as beck and soul coughing. why don't people understand that this cd is just fun music that you can move to? i'm not trying to act like i know g. and what he is trying to do with his music, but i know i have a good time listening to this cd. so if you want to listen to something different from all the metal/rap combination groups and hear a fresh sound, buy this cd and get down."
1,Nice but short life,"The device is nice, it allows to use your ps1 or ps2 controller (which I actually prefer) in the gamecube.The problem is it broke just 3 months after I bought it, so this isn't worth it, buy an original gamecube controller, or another adapter."
2,So many twists and turns,"This is a fun film. You never know what will happen next or who the good guys are. Unlike most standard Hollywood films where you know who's the good guy, who's the bad guy and who's the damsel in distress, this film is full of clever shifts and turns and some very good acting."
1,Poorly Written,"I admit that my programming experience is rather limited, but this book made me feel like a complete .... There is no denying that the author knows what he is writing about, but he does not convey that information in an easily understood manner. Unless you already know everything there is to know about RMI, networking and advanced Java programming, stay away from this book."
2,City of God,I received my order on time and in perfect condition. I would definately buy from this seller again.
1,Mold,Bought this book for class and the text was covered in mold. Working on trying to remove the mold now.
2,Pilot's Perspective,"I like adventure books, especially those that deal with northern flying. This title clearly fell into that catagory. The autor gave us a perspective of the Iditarod race that only a pilot could. As a pilot who has flown in Alaska I found all of his flying information to be accurate. But best of all the book was very well written. The author has polished his work. The chapters are all very readable and fascinating. I would recommend this book to anyone whose interests run along the same lines as mine do; flying, Alaska, adventure and the Iditarod. My only complaint is a complete lack of pictures."
1,Presentation of concepts needs improvement,This booked is packed with information however the presentation needs vast improvement.Specifically the inclusion of a concept map at the beginning that gives a graphic view of hte concepts to be presented. Then concepts maps of each chapter's topics is necessary then. And if possible more concept maps for topics with in each chapter. These concepts would be more understandable with concept maps as graphic organizers of the information presented.
2,More blues and less rock on this one,"Marcia is a fine singer who writes many of her own songs, though she is never afraid to record covers where they are suitable. Her albums can be almost relentlessly upbeat, as with Hot tamale baby, but this is generally a much sadder album - more like one would expect from a blues singer.Marcia still demonstrates her Jerry Lee-ish piano playing here, on the opening Red beans, the third track Down the road and particularly on her cover of Joe Ely's Fingernails, but those are not typical of this particular album.More typical is the title track, in which Marcia painted her house blue after her man left for good, or St Gabriel, about being sent to prison and later being released with nowhere to go.This is a fine album that demonstrates Marcia's ability to sing a variety of different types of song."
2,God bless you Jake,"This book was our Brass Tech. textbook in college. It was great reading it and understanding so much. What helped was our professor had studied with Mr. Jacobs and had a little more insight. This book is very informative, but doesn't read like a text book. Highly recommend to any wind player or music educator."
2,Great game,Picture quality=5sound=3gameplay=4over all the only mess up is that the controls were to loose
2,soon to be the greatest guitar player ever.....great music!!,"not as technical as his last cd but the music reflects exactly what the title is ""undiscovered soul"" Great job Richie, this cd is in my car all the time. Give us some more !!!!"
2,Superb camera -- Buy it now!,"I've used this camera now for 6 months and own 3, 5D bodies! I've used it with the following Canon lenses:24-70mm f/2.870-200mm f/2.885mm f/1.2200mm f/1.8300mm f/2.8I've shot EXTENSIVELY with all lenses WIDE OPEN and have not seen ANY vignettely indicated by a couple of other reviews. Are you kidding me? This thing is super sharp from center to edge.The full-frame censor comes in mighty handy when you need to crop and don't think this is an insignificant thing. If you can perfectly frame all your shots then maybe you don't need this capability.I would highly recommend this camera as the absolute be value out there in a DSLR regardless of brand."
2,Cute,"These shoes are better than I expected. They are adorable and decent enough quality, considering the price. They are a little tight in the toe and I have narrow feet, or so I thought. I went up a size since I fall on a half size normally. I would HIGHLY recommend that others do the same to make the toe more comfortable. Otherwise, they are easy enough to walk in, very cute, and fairly comfortable."
2,Great Time shoe!,I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on! They are pretty comfortable and fun!
2,Halloween Shoes,Perfect for many costumes and not all that uncomfortable. Very happy with the product and price!
1,Rent before you Buy,What a bad movie. Pitch Black was great but this mess doesn't even come close. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I didn't watch the entire movie. I fell asleep half way thru this bomb and didn't want to waste another 3 bucks renting this a 2nd day to finish it.
2,Worth it,"Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series. Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film. It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder ""why...?"" Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is. The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making. The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films. Vin Diesel is great. Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive. He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language. Actually, the action films I own are for watching while I exercise, and this is one I have watched more than once and will undoubtably watch again. Its a good specimen of its' genre."
1,hm,"I would say that the only thing less interesting than the movie itself were the special features included in the disk.Ok, there were definitely some cool action scenes. However, there was little to no character development. The story and subplots seemed to have been ripped off from a bunch of other stories (including the prophecy and the killing of the sons--read mythology much?). The motivations of the characters seemed somewhat random and irrelevant.This dvd was given to me as a gift. I would have never purchased it myself (had I seen the movie). I think this movie is worth watching once, and that's about it. No point to owning it."
2,yes!,this is the best movie I've ever seen. the story is great and the actors couldn't have been chosen any better. I love u vin diesel!
1,Tied with White Chicks for worst Movie of 2004,"How many science fiction and fantasy cliches can you put in a movie? Just watch Riddick and start counting. I seriously think this should have been a parody of sci-fi and fantasy because this movie is THAT BAD. Pitch Black was great but for this ""sequel"" they basically rewrote the Riddick character to fit into this jumbled mess of a movie. The acting was laughable. The story was ridiculous and it stole from movies like Star Wars, Star Trek, LOTR, Escape from New York, forget about it. I don't want to continue listing because I think you should get the point. Don't waste any $$$ or time on tis steaming pile of crap. You might as well call Vin Diesel's career dead or on the same level as Seagal and Van Damme. Straight to cable and DVD."
2,Beautiful butterfly book,"I loved the book because of the beautiful color pictures,small size, soft cover, information on the butterflies.It would be more informative if it had the small United States mapshowing each type of butterflies range. I only need info on Minnesota butterflies at this time."
2,Audubon Society Field Guides,Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.
2,Peterson's is better,This one comes in second. It's definitely for the amateur and is very nicely illustrated. My main beef is it requires too much page flipping and the organization is poor. The one I prefer in the field is Peterson's. It's more pocket sized and quicker for reference use.
1,TOO OLD,"It was last revised in 2002, that's twelve years ago. Need I say more for such a fluid topic. oNE MORE WORD."
1,slow and repetitious,"Having made it to page 88, reading through several repetitions and reminders of character's abilities or facts, I began to wonder whether this would continue. So, I flipped to page 336 and picked up from that point without skipping a beat...or boredom. Needless to say, I did not finish this book--didn't even care who dunit. 2 stars for making it to page 88 and not putting it down sooner."
2,one of my favs,This one of my favorite books of Chris'. I have read them all and can't wait for the next one to come out. He's a great story teller and has a great duo in Jon and David to carry from book to book. Exact.
1,Don't even bother with this one,"It it wern't for Russell Crowe, this would have been a complete failure. The plot takes place in a fictional country in Latin America. The main conflict of the movie is that Meg Ryan's husband gets kidnapped by gorillas. Throughout the movie he is abused, denied of a shave or a shower, and is put to rotten work. Russell Crowe is the man in charge of working out a deal with the gorillas to free Ryan's husband. At the same time there is a sexual tension brewing between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe. In my opinion, it is pretty pathetic that Meg Ryan would show interest in another man while her husband is in captivity by hostile gorillas. The whole movie is really bad, Meg Ryan is a just terrible, the only good part is the action seen at the end, but it doesn't quite save the movie."
1,Nice but,"I saw this movie about four times on a transatlantic flight yesterday (well I really watched it only once...) and I found it somewhat entertaining but not really exciting. Maybe that's a good thing. The drama side was refreshingly life-like (too bad it doesn't cater for today's scandal-hungry soap opera audience).On the other hand, the action side was a disappointment. Sure there was thrilling suspense and bullets and fire and blood, but the outcome was not very realistic. It was almost as bad as ""The Saint."" It was nice entertainment though -- I wish they could rig every war and other sports event the same way."
1,So So Movie,This movie had decent ratings on imdb. I wanted to see an action flick with a mix of thriller. This movie was ok and that exciting. All this have going for it is Russell Crowe.
2,Very Realistc,"Although it takes a little while to get rolling, this movie was surprisingly realistic. It was well done, and has a VERY tense scene near the end, which really makes the whole movie worth while."
2,Superman like you've never seen before,You like superman? You like Russians? The. Put them together and you will get a great story of a world that could have been... A must have for any serious comic collecter
1,Shallow vision of Socialism. Mediocre at best,"Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read. The cover art is beautiful, but the rest inside it really sucks."
2,One of the better Disney films of the 1980s.,"Full of adventure and mystery, in this film, Disney takes a slightly more sophisticated turn and the outcome is really enjoyable. The film has really nice animation especially the scene atop Big Ben. The voice talent is great, especially the dastardly Vincent Price. The villain is good, and very malicious and powerful. The DVD is really good as well. The movie is in a new letterbox treatment- very nice. I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves the Disney film genre."
1,It stinks,"All of the spooky characters of the original Sherlock Holmes, but none of the charm. Dont get this movie for little ones!!!!"
2,MANKIND'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT,"When the aliens land in my backyard, and they come to me and they say ""Earthling, tell us what is the greatest single thing you Earth people have ever accomplished so that we may document your planet's contribution to the Universe"" that's when I will hand them my copy of 'Apocalypse Now' and humbly say ""here"""
2,Very good movie,"A Very good movie, well dispatched in time. The blu ray box bore few bumps on each sides certainly because of the handling"
2,Great movie!!!!,"Godfather director and great cast. Besides the known big names in the movie, there are smaller appearances by a young Harrison Ford, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper and a great cameo by the man that changed Rock n Roll- Bill Graham."
2,"this isn't a bubble gum, shoot'em up movie...","this movie requires intelligence to piece together Coppola's masterpiece. this movie is at stanley kubrick quality. even the way the Door's ""The End"" weaves throughout the movie deserves 5 stars... How could someone say that the ending is weak? It ISN'T VISUAL! It should blow you away mentally... if it doesn't, it went over your head. This movie is very quotable too."
1,Poor DVD quality,I love this movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor. towards the end the DVD stops and starts several times which is very annoying.
1,You really have to be kidding me.....,I'm sorry but I just don't get it.This is a long movieThis is a boring movieI could never understand why people got so into this flick. I find it a great chore to sit through.
1,I wanted to turn this disc into a coaster...,"It may be a classic to many people, but only sheer will and determination allowed me to sit through it. It was horrible. It was long, boring, and pointless. The director intended this film to showcase the different facets of war and the madness that it brings to some people. I should've known the madness was intended for his audience.The story is about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a mission to find and execute the highly decorated and brilliant renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has turned mad (undoubtedly because of war).Please don't waste 3 hours of your life watching this movie.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (writers get all philosophical and artsy with Brando's lines)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (doesn't force you to the edge of your seats, that's for sure)P (Plot) - 1 (Sheen is sent into Cambodia to hunt down Brando, plain and simple)"
1,"BORING, BAD ACTING, NOT REALISTIC, AWFUL","This movie is not worth seeing. Don't waste your time, and go for the newer productions. In the time the movie was made they certainly did not know what they were doing."
1,New BluRay,Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
1,Don't let the packaging fool you!,"I own all 3 apocalypse now's (original, redux, and this)I must say that I have become more and more disappointed as I went down the line.Original version (1979) on DVD contains everything that was meant to be there, just no impressive multimedia or extras.Redux came along and made some desirable but mostly undesirable tweaks to the original.THE VERSION YOU ARE BUYING is in my mind a total rip off to anyone who owns the redux and or original!!!I advise anyone who doesn't own apocalyse now on dvd to go ahead and buy it, BUT IF YOU DO OWN THEM save your money!!!"
1,Two stars for redux five for the original,"Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original."
2,Another Coppola Masterpiece,"Indeed Apocalypse Now is one of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces, along with The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2. Probably one of the movie industry's best war films ever, Coppola's vision of the Vietnam War is unlike any war movie I've ever seen. It truly showed the horrors of the war and the young soldiers who became crazy over the fact they had to be brought into Vietnam without experience. Ranking #28 in AFI's 100 movies of all-time, I believe it fits the right place. I now can't wait to see Hearts of Darkness: A Film Maker's Apocalypse. And one more thing: Marlon Brando couldn't have performed his part any better."
2,"Haunting Film, Semi-Dissapointing Disc","The first time I saw Apocalypse Now for my 9th grade Vietnam War project I knew I had seen something special, but was left saying ""huh?"" Upon furthur viewing and reading the book it was based on It's becoming a little less hazy, but it's a film I'll be watching over and over again just to get underneath all those layers of the story. The film is topped with great performances my Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall. The other actors in the film are also great. The cinematography is excellent and the great transfer does not dissapoint. The sound is pretty good, but it could've used a little more bass. Overall the sound and video are great, but it's the lack of extras that dissapointed me. Although you do get the napalming of Kurtz's compound with or without commentary, that's about it for extras. A Francis Ford Coppola commentary for the film might've been nice. Oh well. Overall it's a disc well worth purchasing."
2,The greatest war film in history,"It puts ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"" in the shade. This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever. It topically transfers the setting of Joseph Conrad's epic novella ""Heart of Darkness"" from the Congo to Vietnam, although it leaves the story, themes and characters relatively intact. Marlon Brando offers an intimidating and overpowering performance. The impact he exerts in the film is profound, even though his face remains in shadow for the most of the duration of his appearance. A classic of the now outdated genre of Vietnam films."
2,''this is the end..'',"astonishing film,great performances,the story of Nam,''the end''was or is like that..Brando was''god''.."
2,Good classic,"This album made earth wind and fire a pop group. Shining Star, That's the way of the world and reasons are hot. However, the songs are just as good."
2,EWF is still the best.,"I listened to this album as a high school student and am happy to have the remastered CD in my possesion. See the Light is still my favorite song, however this entire album is in my opinion EWF's 2nd best (All 'n All being my favorite) There does not exist today this kind of musicianship and talent in a band."
2,Greatest of All Time,"This, put very simply, is the greatest recording of all time. The opening riffs of ""Shining Star"" followed by the explosion of the horns signals the birth of a musical world the likes that have never been duplicated. The seamless edits between songs and the small interludes lets the journey flow without interruption. The incredibly tight music of the band coupled with Maurice White and Phillip Bailey's vocals are unmatched, especially on ""That's the Way of the World,"" the best cut on the CD. ""Reasons"" still never fails to unite lovers to this day. The best thing to do is just grab a bottle of wine, hit play, and let it go from start to finish. It never fails to satisfy."
2,Mortal Kombat Trilogy the bomb?,"MKT is really a great game! It takes all of the best features from MK1-3 and translates them flawlessly onto the Playstation platform. This allows die-hard fans like me to play it without the Sega or SNES. However there are two glitches that kind of bother me. One is the fatalities. Sub-Zero's old rip of the head is cut out, and there is no ice grenade to name a few problems. The second is the difficulty level. No matter if you chose Easy and Novice for the tournament, the computer will tear you up in less than 30 seconds once you get up toward the end of the latter! Even if you are Kintaro, Shao Kahn will destroy you. I still haven't beat it. Other than that for [price], it is definently worth it. :)"
2,Mortal Kombat!!!,"Personally I think that this is the last of the good Mortal Kombats, I don't really kare too much for the one's with all the weapons plus the kombos were Killer in this one. I just like some of the kharacters from the new. I'm glad someone still has this game around. I only have too complaints it seems to freeze up after a 2 player game is done, therefore you have to reset it and the whole Shang Tsung loading thing, other than that I enjoy it and it brings back teenage memories."
2,if color doesnt matter this is for you,Fits perfect just a taupe color but it was cheaper to get this color than to get black. We needed for an extra vehicle so it worked perfectly.
1,Elevator Bensusan.,"Yuk. Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts. In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different. The problem is, I just dont like this kind of music.This is not solo guitar with some vocals like his other albums, this is fully produced, jazzy-mainstream new agey music. It would work well in an office or elevator setting.NOT the heart felt solo guitar chops and vocal genius that his other recordings capture. If you get the pleasure of listening to any of his other albums, you will think its an entirely different musician. This is so different, i have to say its Pierre Bensusan, ""NOT""!I reccomend ANY other album by Bensusan, besides this one. Unless, of course, you enjoy mild, new-agey, jazz instrumental albums...if thats the case then you may like it."
2,This has been my absolute favorite movie since i saw it,"This is movie fosuses on an 11 year old girl's life.she has no mother, and her father works in a funeral home.having only a dad and living in a funeral parlor is only part of Vada's problems. she is absolutely sure she is going die and her only friend is Thomas J. Vada's life begins to turn around after her dad meets Brenda, who, little by little, helps Vada cope with life and death."
2,My favourite move EVER!,"This movie is good too the end! It shows the uncertainties of being a young girl, and the troubles of having growing up and having a father remarry, etc. Anna Chlumsky does an excellent job in this movie, and Macaulay Culkin plays a very convincing best friend. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry!"
2,"She is Strange, but She Has Great Talent.","This is very....interesting CD. She sings about common things but she doesn't make them sound common. She makes them alternative and what a real alternative CD should be about. Her song ""I Try"" is great along with ""Sexomatic Venus Freak,"" ""I Can't Wait to Meetchu,"" and ""Why Didn't You Call Me."" These songs will turn out to be great hits and some already have. This is a great value for such a great CD."
1,Let Down,"I heard a lot of people talking up this album on the Grammy's so I bought after hearing only the too much played cut"" I try"". I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about dragging some black girl off the shreets to prop up in front of a mike. I miss spelled streets similar to spelling ""you"" ""chu"" . Come on folks this is not even audable english. I bought Tracy Chapmans new one at the same time and WHAT a contrast. Macy Grey is going to the used dc store."
2,Talking all night long,"I sat up all night. I talk to this beautiful lady I met all night long while this, and a few other few slow jams played.. I can tell you if you are in the mood to sip wine, talk about life, and get closer to someone toss this cd on the spinner, and open your mind. If you want to hear something that is close, goto mp3, look up ""d.a. young"" and listen to ""father's father's house."" You will not be sorry. =)"
2,Macy Gray is one of the best,I loved that song I TRYED and the rest is really good too. I am looking forward to buying her album
1,Puh-lease!,"I can't turn my radio fast enough when I hear ""I Try"" coming on. It's like a car wreck. You don't want to see it, you have to turn forcefully away, and if you do see it it will haunt you. Her voice is ABOMINABLE, like fingernails on a chalkboard. The fact that anyone likes her is more proof that if you're just over-the-top horrible, some people will take it as a sign of greatness. Get Biz Markie as your vocal coach, have some songs written professionally for you, and you too could be a star."
2,Gray Matters,"This is a strong, unique debut from such a super talent. Macy Gray growls with that she-ra soul, that Tina-Earth-Kitt, lazy groove Billie Holiday in a funked out, disco-ready, rhymthic blues sorta way. Macy may not be for everyone but that doesn't mean this sista is a one hit wonder. With the radio play of superifical, dry, booty songs, Macy Gray is a refreshing taste for those who want to hear some soul. For those who wanna hear that skreeching voice that sounds almost unreal, possibly surreal. This is for those who wanna expand in what they call music. Who don't pry themselves by the standards of what is current and pop. This for those who want something with spice, class, sass, and appeal. Macy Gray soars with her brand of old-school remixed with new school funk. That neo-funk, that makes your favorite 70's albums proud."
1,Turkey Rather Than One Star:,"What's wrong with Hollywood? Just like the pure idea alone of Silence of the Limbs would amaze you well enough, the idea of this movie will, oppositely, sicken you all the way. Remember The Watcher (badly enough in its own rights), would be a classic comparing with this one.I am still confused why good actors like these two would take on a project like this. After two hours of viewing, not only careful consideration of choosing future title is needed, but also watching some boxing just to drive away the disgust this movie left."
1,the dishwasher !!,"I could tolerate most of the illogical anguished drama (hell, I could forgive Charlize Theron anything), but then they lost me completely with the dishwasher!!"
1,Pretty much what you'd expect,"I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer, but definitely unwilling to pay to view it. Fortunately, it came on HBO while I was staying in a hotel, and I could watch for free. It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless. Keanu Reeves performed better than he historically has, but Charlize Theron was fairly flat. Though the premise was marginally interesting, the plot is completely predictable. One bright spot was Jason Isaacs as Chaz/Cherry, who delivers his usual caliber of excellence. It did jerk the obligatory tear from me at the end, but that's largely because I'm easy that way. Four yawns and two stars."
1,Have no interest in it,I just got this for my class and I just not interested about other people. I'm more interested in creating things than reading about it.
1,Help your Dog Fight Cancer,"This is the most informative book I've ever read on the subject. Also a very moving story which I will read over and over again!The info on veterinarians, oncologists and web-sites is incredable!A MUST buy, also for those whose dogs do NOT have cancer."
2,great camera,a great camera to take with you every day takes great pictures and takes up no room in your pocket
2,Best game I've ever played,If you like video games this game is a must have. It features awesome graphics and is 3D. If you can get only one game for your Game Cube get this one!!!Pacman has always been my favorite game except it has been in 2D this is the 1st Pacman Game I've Played that is actually in 3D!!!VERY long game that takes weeks to beat!!!tHE BOTTOM LINE IS TO BUY THIS GAME!!!
1,The movie was positively dreadful,"I didn't have high hopes for this film, seeing how it was a bomb at the box office. Now I know why. Seems they put a lot of money into effects and then just let Will Ferrell and Danny McBride kinda improv through the entire thing. They miss more than they hit, that's for sure. I imagine if you were sitting a room of half drunk frat boys, it'd be hilarious, but I barely cracked a smile through the whole thing. It's unfortunate also that the old series was family oriented and this is barely one step below R-rated humor. Skip this film (like most people did when it came out) and rent the original series instead."
1,Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen,"Land of the Lost stars Will Ferrell, as Rick Marshall, a scientist. It was so bad, I left the theater 20 minutes into it. First off, what's up with the cheesy special effects? (aliens) I guess that's supposed to be funny, but it's not. Right before I walked out, a dinosaur was running after them, and they stoped to take a picture, so that they had proof, of this new world. Yeah. I will tell you straight up that I'm not a Will Ferrel fan, so maybe this wasn't for me. But this is so utterly dull, uninteresting, boring, and idiotic, that I couldn't even watch it."
1,... really?,"Will Ferrell has been in some hilariously wonderful movies. Elf, Talladega Nights, Blades of Glory... but this movie is NOT one of them. It was just... holy mother of god! Yes, this movie was supposed to be funny... but it failed on pretty much every level. The acting is awful and so is the writing. The only reason I saw this was because it was playing on TV several nights ago, and I am glad I did not pay to see it."
1,stay away from this movie,"I have seen many movies,and I am a huge Will Ferrel fan.Will got paid too much in this ""piece of c--p"" movie. There wasn't any plot. The story was all over the place. They threw in some dinosaurs, and a pool scene. Why sit around and watch junk, you will thank me later that you passed this stupid movie up. If you want to see Will in the only good movie he has made. See Stranger Than Fiction. Even his most recent movie was a flop. I consider a flop when you experience ""forced laughter"". The recent movie I am mantioning is The Other Guys. take care and happy viewing."
1,Warped tale should get lost and stay there,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Bad dialogue2. Bad acting3. Bad script4. Bad movie - bad, bad movie!Need I say more?Ferrell and company lamely limp their way through this uninspired big screen version of a seventies' TV series.So horrid are the dialogue and plot that this movie makes Brendan Fraser's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" look like a National Geographic special.The end result of watching this tale of a time-warp -adventure-gone-stupid is a splitting headache from trying to keep your eyebrows in your head.This is one that should remain lost.Amanda Richards, September 19, 2009"
1,Two hours of my life wasted,"If you are a fan of the original TV series you will be sorely disappointed. This movie bears little resemblance to the TV show other than character names and some sleestak. If you are not familiar with the TV series and have no expectations then you might find it mildly entertaining if you have a ""simple"" sense of humor. But anyone with more than half a brain is likely to consider this movie really dumb."
1,Horrible! Absolutly horrible! Worst movie ever!,"Horrible, stupid, its Will Ferril's best yet! This was the DUMBEST movie we have EVER seen(even worse than Freedom State)!!! Don't waste your money! Will Ferril is an amazingly stupid actor. If you have a brain the size of a walnut you will enjoy this movie!(If your brain is any bigger please do not watch, it will destroy your brain cells)My IQ is now 60...it used to be 125."
1,Terrible and a waste of time and money,"This is the worst movie you will ever watch...no plot, no story, terrible casting and nothing to do with the original series. Ugh. It sucks."
1,1 star = 1 laugh,"this movie was terrible. the dialog seemed as if it was written by a high school student, the plot devices were more than contrived, they were ridiculous. there was 1 good laugh in this movie. it was such a poorly made movie i had no desire to watch the extra features. i just wanted to get the dvd out of my player. thank god i rented this piece of garbage instead of buying it.if you liked the first one, you may like this. i thought the first one was marginally funny. i personally think i'm too intelligent for this movie. the humor was soporific and generally appeals to the LCD in everyone. it just so happens my LCD is way above most people Highest Common Denominator.whatever."
2,A VERY FUNNY SEQUEL TO AMERICAN PIE!,"I got a VCD of this movie from my friend (which was in terrible quality) and thought it was hilarious. I even invited a couple of girl friends over to watch it with me, and they liked it. I of course saw the R-Rated version and thought it was good. But now I have seen the Unrated version and it is 6 minutes funnier! Altogether this is an awesome DVD to own, with 10 hours of bonus features and it looks great in the full-frame format. I can't wait to own this movie!"
2,A Better Pie,"American Pie 2 was an excellent sequel to the first American Pie movie. The story is pretty simple. Everyone's now in College, and for the Summer Vacation, the guys try to make it the best one Ever!To me AP2 is even better than the first. American Pie contained more of the everyday sexual encounters that teenage comedies now have. When I saw the first movie I wasn't really up for it because I already knew what was going to happen (except for the bedroom part). But, For American Pie 2, I was really surprised that even though it still had sexual situations (which I thought was even funnier that the first) it also had heart.It really made me realise that the characters have grown up and are taking things a bit more seriously. From their relationship with friends and family.This Second Pie is totally a must-see to anyone who's seen the first."
1,this cant be happening,"I cant believe that a sequel came out for american piesame tasteless humorsame story linesame starssame everythingthis is just another attempt by filmakers to make high schoolers think that when they go to ""college"" its going to be one beer guzzling party after another and they will get through their first year with flying colorsI know this because it brainwashed a buncha of students at my school, always trying to get laid, into parties and how much they will enjoy their ""freedom"" in collegebad movie"
2,Hilarious!,"Irreverant comedy at its finest! The sequel was better than the original, and I loved the original! The actors were great, but I was really impressed with Alyson Hannigan in this flick. She was able to make her band geek character funny and deep. I noticed that she appeared in more of the outtakes than any other actor/actress. I look forward to seeing more of her work. This is on my greatest comedy list forever!"
2,Fusion jazz gem from the masters,"This hard to find CD is a must for fans of fusion jazz. The groundbreaking quartet of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Al DiMeola, and Lenny White provide the true fusion of rock and jazz with the hard driving ""Earth Juice"" and ""Vulcan World"". And then the solo piano of the title tune provides a surpassingly sweet moment of peace. Along with their classic Romantic Warrior and Weather Report's ""Heavy Weather"" this CD is a classic of early-mid-70's fusion jazz."
1,This DVD has not been released yet,Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received. I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04. Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet.
1,More like The Snore.,"OK, it's Corman so you gotta cut him some slack, but this one couldn't terrify a tourist in Disneyland. Karloff is you're typical SOB--Scary Old Baron; Nicholson's a miscast as a lovestruck Napoleanic officer (French lieutenant? Stick to LA gumshoe, Jake.); and what about that Community Theater witch?! Maybe they should have burned the sets down while filming--a la Gone with the Wind--in order to add some excitement to this one."
1,A caveat to DVD purchasers,"WARNING to anyone thinking of purchasing the D-Vision DVD edition of THE TERROR: It is not the letterbox edition touted in Amazon's writeup (my sole reason for ordering it). REPEAT: It is not widescreen; it is in full-screen format, and appears to have been mastered from an EP VHS source."
2,Humourous Insight,Potpourri of life is a poetic and humourous look in the problems that so many of us face in our everyday lives. When is the second book coming?
1,Leave your brain and taste at the door,"""Danger Kitty"" has mass produced some of the worst music in the history of Pop. To all of the BJ fans out there, look up the word, ""cliche"". Understand its danger and the shallow nature that this word connotes. It's ahem !! like a ""wet, slippery, loaded gun"". If you're going to write lyrics this horrible, juvenile and unimaginative, why bother finishing Junior High at all. Drop out of school, get yourself a job at Hot Dog on a Stick and say goodbye to every one of your brain cells. Patriotism demands that you rid your CD player of anything that makes you look like you couldn't finish the 4th grade. Do it for your country!"
1,So incredibly overrated..,"Bon Jovi are in close competition with Nirvana for the ""Most Overrated Band in History"" award. If I had a dollar for every time I heard the cr@ppy ""Living on a Prayer"" played on the radio, I'd be able to retire in comfort, and I'm only 21! I can only reccommend this album to people who like to annoy themselves with $hitty music."
1,Wow was this bad!,"I just got back from seeing this terrible, terrible movie and felt the need to share my feelings in a review. Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. From the opening scene with the crowd of the jousting match singing We Will Rock You, I knew I was in trouble. There should surely be a rule about using 70s rock anthems in movies about jousting that are set before 1970, or for any movies about jousting. I now understand why there have been so few jousting movies out, because it's boring. Once you see one person get knocked off their horse, you've seen it all. This movie is acted horribly, written horribly, and directed horribly. Save your money and go buy a best of 70s Rock compilation album instead."
1,Ridiculous!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Heath Ledger, as a lead actor, is terrible. In fact, all the actors in this movie are extremely bad. The story is poor and ridiculous. On the other side, if it had not been for a movie like this one, we would not be able to fully appreciate a good movie. Therefore, take my advice- do not rent this movie! It goes without saying that this movie deserves much criticism as there are many flaws and shortcomings. In conclusion, if you see this movie I can assure you that you will be disappointed."
2,"Don't buy the ""Extended"" Edition!","If you're a fan of Brian Helgeland, Paul Bettany (Chaucer), or just commentary tracks in general, don't buy the extended edition. The regular DVD has every feature the ""extended"" edition does - it just doesn't insert the deleted scenes into the movie. They're included as bonus features. This extended edition does not include the hilarious and insightful commentary track by Helgeland and Bettany, which is really the best thing about the DVD. You get more features for less money by buying the regular DVD release."
1,Save Your Money,This movie ranks right next to Red Tomahawck as one of the worst movie I have seen. The acting is not bad but the story was as cliche ridden as the fifth sequeal to a Rocky movie. You see better stories in old Tarzan movie's. How many time's can you watch a knight get struck while riding a horse. Heath Ledger is the Babe Ruth of knight's. There are no odd's he cannot overcome and man those he overcome the odd's. Superman better watch out. Now if Sylvester Stallone was a knight then you would have a contest. Give your money to a charity or pay off an old debt and avoid this rubbish.
2,The Best,I saw this movie and LOVED IT!!!! It was the best ever. The soundtrack is really good too. The characters are well delveloped. In my opinion it is a football movie but with horses and lances. This is my all time favorite movie!
2,Rock and Roll Jousting,"The soundtrack is a character all its own in this film. This is the story of a poor young boy who grows up in the shadow of a jousting champion, who like all champions must one day face the fact that he can no longer be the best.The boy's father is his hero, even though he basically sells him into servitude. He tells his son he can change his destiny, that nothing should stand in his way.This boy lives by those words. This is a typical story of society boundaries and poor boy meets rich girl. With the added character of classical rock and roll matched with medieval backdrop, you'll sit rivoted to your seat anticipating the realistic jousting matches and playing name that tune!"
1,Drivel,"OK, what a waste of time, don't get me wrong I love horror movies just as much as the next fiend, but this one takes the cake for stupidity. How can you make a horror movie that is so utterly devoid of suspence? I feel sorry for teens who think that today's horror movies are actually scary, they should check out Hallaween and Friday the 13th to see how it's really done. I guarantee that if they saw Michael Myers or Jason delivering spine shattering blows upon thier victims and death from above they would change their tunes."
1,Nobody want's to be this Mama's boys Valentine.,"Your typical, average, unoriginal masked man killing off people that he doesn't like. Not only that, People that don't like him. That don't love him. This whole things has been done to death and I'm sick of it. Enough with the killer's in masks. Many others have come before this one. Some where more entertaining than others but still, give it a rest already. Nothing is done different and everything is flawed in this movie. It's a complete waste of time.Here's a list of all the others that seem EXACTLY similiar to this undying tune:1. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER2. I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER3. SCREAM4. SCREAM 25. SCREAM 36. HIGHSCHOOL DEATH7. THE ENTIRE JASON VORHEES SERIES8. THE ENTIRE MICHAEL MEYERS SERIES9. URBAN LEGEND10. URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUTfINAL vERDICT: This deserves to be forgotten."
2,The best moddern day horror film of them all!,"Let me start out by saying that this movie will make the easily scared piss their pants! The origionality of this film is so hard to come by these days. When a group of attractive young girls humiliate a nerd at the valentines day dance, he vows revenge on all of them. 13 years later they recieve thretening valentines and gifts. The gift that Jessica Cauffiel's character Lily gets will make the squeamish throw up! Anyway, One by one they are hunted down by a crazed killer wearing a cupid mask. Very creative death scenes including arrows, power drills, shards of glass, axes and more. Great soundtrack too! I rate it an A+! Stars Denise Richards, Marly Shelton, Jessica Cauffiel, Jessica Capshaw, Kathrine Heigel, Hedy Burress and David Boreanza."
1,Tom Savage should sue,"This is possibly the worst book to movie transition I have ever seen. Whereas the book was a five star thriller, the movie is just another cheap slasher film with absolutely nothing to redeem it from the crap that it is. I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear ""Valentine"" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie. In fact I recently reread the book and realized, with the exception of the title, the book is an entirely different story. If you have not seen the movie, don't waste your time, read the book instead."
1,This game sucks,"Yes, the graphics are goods but this game sucks big time. I rented it and I'm glad thats all I did.Tip to the people who are considering on buying this game, rent it first because you don't want to get stuck with this game."
1,HUH>?,"I rented this game expecting some fast and furious gameplay, the truth is, is that thats all you get. No statistics or roster changes!!!! Thats a major blow, besides that it has dumb gimics like when you have to play against a team of dolphins... WHY??? I recommend renting it first, the graphics are the only good thing about it, all you do is play play play, it gets pretty redundant and boring after a while, with no stats or rosters to look at."
1,Extremly desapointing!!,"I first read ""Kane & Abel"" also by J. Archer, this one book was so good that even though I know that second parts are not as good as first parts I wanted to read it.This turn out to be an incredibly disapointing book, so much that I had to make a huge effort to keep reading and dont put the book on the trash.More than half of the book only repeats what we already knew from ""Kane & Abel"", and the rest was just the worst plot ever.How can someone writte so well first and then just be the worst writter ever?I just regret to have buy this book in the first place."
1,Soap opera,This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up. I just could not maintain any interest in the continueing lives of Florentyna and Richard.I'm sure they went on to even greater fame and fortune...I just don't care.
2,Recommendation with Enthusiasm,"Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one."
1,Lost interest after the hot tub scene.,"This movie had plenty of laughs, but I lost all interest after the two naked men pull owen wilson from the hot tub. Could have totally done without seeing that. If you can overlook that scene then I guess it was an alright move, maybe 3 1/2 stars."
1,"Since When Does ONE Deleted Scene = ""Special Features?""","If you loved this movie and want the DVD for the outrageous special features you can't get on rental DVDs - outtakes, bloopers, commentary, interviews, behind the scenes, etc - DON'T BOTHER! The ""special features"" (which I can't believe they had the nerve to make plural) include ONE deleted scene. ONE. Why even bother??? Save yourself some money and buy a previous rental copy. Note to the studio: if you're planning a ""special edition"" in the future with all these features in the hopes of getting my money twice...it's not happening."
2,Great purchase,I chose to buy this during the Black Friday deals weekend and it's a great purchase! This was a great purchase!
2,"Good Movie,",Seen this with my girl friend and she wanted the movie for ever. We ordered this and it showed up the same day as it was released.
1,Not as funny as I expected,This movie fails on many levels to deliver on what I expected to be a much funnier outing for Wilson. The movie falls down on humor and really overall quality. Don't get me wrong - there are some funny moments but they are few and further between than I would have liked. I didn't like the characters enough to care what happened to them and I didn't believe what happened to them when it did happen. The blonde is not believable and she is unlikely as the realistic sexual interest for Owen Wilson (unless he is OWEN WILSON - ACTOR and not the character in the movie).This is not a movie that I will watch again. Better than Bad Teacher - MUCH MUCH MUCH worse than Wedding Crashers (my benchmark film in this genre).
1,a very disappointing movie.,whats up with hollywood? what a big disappointment. I want watch another movie that Peter Farrelly directs or if he's even is involved with it.
1,Sucked,"Some funny parts here and there, but mostly sucked. It definitely wasn't worth paying to watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but if you could get it free, it might be ok."
2,HIGHEST Recommendation,"I loved every word of this book. Knock your socks off story, rich characters, and as about as relevant as you can possibly get. Will now go read more of this writer's books and hope their half as good."
2,Best of a Classic,"He may be old, but this is an exceptionally rockin slab of fun. One of the outstanding rockers of all time successfully translates his live show to the studio. Every song is dynamite, and very well recorded."
1,This book was just terrible,"I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny."
1,Buy the Update,"I bought this book for $250 and I also bought ""How to Create and Manage a Mutual Fund or Exchange-Traded Fund"" 9780470120552 for ~$70. This book was paper back and the ""How to create..."" book was hardback and copy written 3 years later (2008 compared to 2005 of this book.) The words are mostly the same on the mutual fund side, but they have added exchange traded funds into the book. All the graphs are updated and it is written by the same author."
1,Did I just get a lemon?,"I find the reviews that extol this as a long-serving workhorse quite interesting -- and frustrating. I had this chopper and used it only about a half dozen times, though had it over a year. It just stopped working. B&D customer service didn't even express regret at my experience and refused to do anything about it. Since I had a B&D toaster oven (almost $100 on sale) that also gave out after just over a year, I won't be buying any more of their products."
1,Junk,"Creates mush, and not uniform either, big chunks and mush. I wanted it to chop up peppers and like foodstuffs."
1,Frustrating and ineffective.,"I find this chopper to be frustrating and ineffective. Food is always getting under the blades, pushing them up so that the blade is no longer caught by the drive shaft. This happens chopping something as easily chopped as onions, so forget having any success at the harder items, like nuts!The button is also very difficult to press. My young children used to help out on the kitchen by using the mini-chopper, but everyone except my 9 year old are unable to do so.I'm shopping for a new model...and hoping for better luck!"
2,chopper/mincer,"This Black & Decker chopper/mincer although small provides an excellent service for us. Perhaps we are easily satisfied because of the size of our hosehold, there are only two of us but we have no complaints about the efficiency and effectivenessBlack & Decker HC306 1-1/2-Cup One-Touch Electric Chopperof this purchase."
2,Infrequent Chopper,"I don't cook much but when I do, I hate having to chop everything and this little guy is a big help in the kitchen."
1,The Black & Decker Chopper Plus.,"The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than 1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product. I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one."
2,Great,"I work at a fire dept, so as we are known for I am always cooking. This makes cutting vegetables so easy. Within seconds you can have them cut. I can't believe I didn't buy one of these sooner."
1,"The worst chopper I have ever used, from the first use!","We had high expectations with this, based on other reviews.We make pesto for home use with our old one that was my grandmothers for we don't know how long. Grandmother's was a different brand too.Anyways. We opened it, put the stuff in to make a small batch of pesto and we had to trash that batch and the chopper started smoking, as if it were overloaded.It's bad if you need to chop anything more than water, and even then, I think it would be bad at it."
1,Don't watch this movie!,"This movie is total Bull! anybody who claims to like it, is probably faking it. The people who appreciate this movie, are probably like those who go to an Art Exhibition and appreciate Picaso's paintings, even though they know that the paintings are total Bull! hahathe other movies of Coen Brothers rock! but this movie is total bull!I hope nobody goes thru the same pain I did while watching this movie.Bottom line: This movie has no story! really! so, if you wanna spend time watching a good movie, then this movie is NOT for you!"
1,dissapointing,"The book is pretty good, though nowhere near as good as the Godfather. While the book keeps a secret that brings everything together until the very end, the movie bizarrely gives the secret away in the first 10 minutes. I realize you don't have as much time to work with in a movie/TV series, but this makes everything fairly predictable. Lots of lame acting as well, even by otherwise-good actors."
1,dull and pointless,"This movie starts off like a mystery/thriller, but quickly becomes a slow-moving and ultimately unsatisfying attempt at a character study. Do not watch it expecting to see a cop movie, or anything other than nicholson playing drunk."
1,Bad Movie,"Typical excellent acting by Nicholson, but the movie was SLOW, poorly organized and had nothing besides Nicholson. The ending was very poorly done."
1,Just bad,"Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance in this slow plodding movie.Jack clearly made this movie as a favor to his friend Sean Penn.Penn should stick to acting.The cut aways the distracting music,very disapointed."
2,Classroom Teacher Loved It,"The first time I heard this book was while I was a guest teacher in second grade classroom. A parent choose to read this book to the class and they were enthralled. They could not take their eyes off the book and they could not stop talking about it afterwards. The next week when I was filling in for the librarian I decided to read this book to the third graders. They loved it partly because it was a new book to add to their holiday favorites. I wanted to add it to my library before the holidays but the book was nowhere to be found, except online. I was devasted but I will be ready to share this book with all my students next year."
1,Don't buy,"Stay away from baseball game this year. Without MVP baseball having the mlb license, the games just aren't worth the time and money. MLB the show, has terrible game play and overall isn't fun to play. I bought MLB the show one night and sold it the next. MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don't buy that either."
2,Great Game,It is a great game. The rosters are updated really good. Except it doesn't have my favorite baseball player Barry Bonds. There is a lot of new gane modes like Rivalry Mode. I like Franchise mode a lot it's fun.I thought MLB 2K6 would be better but it's not I rated it 5 stars to. I think you should get MLB 06 THE SHOW if you like really realistic games but get MLB 2K6 if you like kind of realistic games but is real easy.
2,What are you waitn' for?,"Hey everbody this Cd is awesome...the girls rock, and don't give this CD any second thoughts! Make sure to listen to Say my Name, Bugaboo, and Bills, Bills, Bills!"
2,great album,"I really like this album. ""So Good"" is a really good upbeat song, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" is a cool song about a bad relationship about a guy who takes things from them to be cool, ""Confessions"" isn't exactally the best song that could be on the album and Missy Elliot is kinda the backup singer in the song and it's redundant. ""BUGABOO"" is the BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE ALBUM! It has a great beat and is one you will repeat on the album. ""Temptation"" talks about how there's a guy they wan't but they already have boys. The last songs were what made me think twice about giving them 5 stars. The songs have annoying beats upset for the Outro. If you are a DC fan buy this album. I own both albums and the Destiny's Child today hasn't had another album in awhile.i saw them on tour a while ago and they were so awesome."
1,"an OK album, not great",This was not as good as I had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while I am working out but the rest is good.
2,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!,"I thought this CD was sooooo cool. At first, i didn;t think I'd like it becuase I'm a pretty big BSB/NSync/98 degrees/5ive fan, but I thought I'd give it a try. Woah! I was blown away! The tracks are cool, the lyrics are cool, Destiny's Child is cool! You've gotta get it!"
2,One of the best Courtroom Dramas,Amazing screenplay put on screen. A three hour journey back into the JFK controversy which shook up America and the world. Costner in rare form gives an unbelievable performance. A must see.
2,Most Accurate Movie Ever,Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
2,Blew my mind.,"I relived the same moments JFK had.And Oliver Stone saying that ""JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive.""Not just chilling, but so bone-chilling that it took me a long time to sleep.For sheer effect, it is on same par as ConspiracyConspiracymovie.The way each fact is researched thoroughly, the rattling inside the team of DA, and Jim's reaction to Robert Kennedy's assasination, my God."
1,"Poor history, bad acting, terrible movie","This is truly a bad movie....The historical ""premise"" is incorrect. JFK expanded the war in Vietnam, and there is no reason to believe that he would have changed his mind if he had not been assasinated. The conspiracy plot is laughable. I did not think it was possible for me to feel sympathy for Lyndon Johnson, a failure as President, but the movie almost invoked those feelings by portraying him as a conspirator against JFK. Kevin Costner is awful as Garrison. His accent is amateurish, for example. Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor who puts in a credible performance."
2,"So, you don't buy Stone's conspiracy theory?","Whether or not the film answers the questions surrounding the death of President Kennedy, it does boast bravura performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and, in a small yet memorable cameo, Larry Hagman. John Williams also contributes a very subtle yet powerful score, simultaneously ominous and poignant."
1,"Some good advice, but not worth buying","I started reading this book, and while it seems to have some good points, the writing is pretty bad (strange for a book on writing to be poorly written). She keeps repeating herself over and over, about how successful she is. While trying to inspire, she is also depressing, that it may take years or decades to get yourself established. I don't think so...sounds like she's just trying to make money from this book, yet wants to discourage any new competition! Take my advice and buy the ""Well Fed Writer"" by Peter Bowerman. His advice is better, his writing is funny and very readable, and he doesn't speak to the reader like they're a moron. Which Flynn does, by the way."
1,dull!,its a dull film- theres not nearly enough JRM in it as id liked and some unknown reason we keep getting these pictures of rivers and babies and this Adam and Eve duo! does anyone understand what its about except the director?
2,Gotta see it to believe it.,"2001: A Space Odyssey meets Blue Velvet. It's as carefully paced and music-laden as the former, as far from redemption as the latter. Don't read any blurbs or summaries, just watch it."
1,"B.S., B.S., B.S.!!!!!!!!!","The idea of this movie has got to be the biggest crock of *!%#. Science tells us that the first woman and man were AFRICAN, so why do we have a White woman playing ""Eve""??? One can clearly see the explicit attempt to mock and separate the holy union between an African man and woman. First, the Egyptians were white and now Eve????? Give me a break. I'm just glad I have the knowledge to see through this trash."
1,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION,"Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty."
1,"Dumb As Hell , But Watchable","Soldier is one of those films that was just made to be poked fun at. Everything about this film is familiar. The plot is basically Escape From New York meets The Road Warrior. Russell and Busey deserve better than this. The action is a joke, and the acting is hilarious. Just watch this to laugh."
1,Lied about the size,"We love this movie and it was listed as 1:77 in size. When we recieved it the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don,t buy this movie unless you want to watch the movie with the heads cut off ."
1,Whiz Bang Ending But it misses the mark.,"Well after watching a wonderfully violent, strangely poetic ending I found myself liking this film alot more than I did the first hour into it. They try to make us like the main character who has no personality and they try to make us care for the community he falls into, but the film is so full of cliches and poor characterization that the first hour meanders and the ending though fun and exciting , a bit more hollow than I'd like."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,Kurt was pulling a arnold job. I think he had about two lines of dialoge through out the intire movie. The story is pretty good.I'm sorry I purchased it. Should have rented it first.
1,Stay Away!,"My experience with this device was horrible. It took weeks to get it to work right, I spent hours on the phone with tech support who couldn't figure out why. Finally the ""master tech"" spoke to ""the designers"" and they sent me some software update which made it work. However this was after 2 replacements that all failed to work (Windows XP)Even once it workd it turned out that the software is incompatible with Vista.And when I had to wipe my XP computer and wanted to reinstall it, I found that all software download link were removed from smarthome's web site, leaving me with a useless wall wart.BUYER BEWARE: STAY AWAY!"
2,The Shop Around the Corner,"They don't make romantic comedies like they used to, and no one made them quite like director Ernst Lubitsch, whose famed ""touch"" lights this wry, poignant, perennially charming film. Veteran players Stewart and Sullavan are a perfect match as comically antagonistic lonelyhearts, conveying their characters' vulnerabilities with a delicacy too often missing from the tepid Hanks-Ryan remake, ""You've Got Mail"". Rich subplots involving the wonderful Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut, who plays a scheming, boastful employee, let Lubitsch impart further nuance to this modest but wholly pleasing tale. A delight from start to finish, this is one ""Shop"" you'll want to dally in."
2,What You've Got Mail Should Have Been,"With an ensemble cast that could only exist when the studio system was in full flower, this classic film unites Stewart with friend Henry Fonda's wife in a charming and quirky romance tour de force. It's easy to see why they team that transmuted Affair to Remember into Sleepless in Seattle thought they could recapture the magic of big box office. But it was impossible for Hanks and Ryan to live up to the charm and allure of Sullivan or Stewart. This film must be in the library of anyone who admires excellence and a joyful celebration of love."
2,Corner Shop review,"wonderful movie! Classic Jimmie Stewart. Great for the entire family to watch. If you enjoyed ""You've Got Mail"" with Ryan and Hanks, you should enjoy this movie - it's a similar storyline, though with snail mail, not email."
2,Excelente livro!,Uma rápida olhada no índice do livro atestam que estou diante de um conteúdo bastante promissor. O papel e a impresso deixam a desejar. A encadernao é frágil para o tamnho do livro.
2,I echo the 5-star rating of this book,"I was introduced to this book by staff at my local children's book store. I was intrigued with the concept of the book being written from the perspective of a boy's journal, as I glanced through it before buying it. That night I read it, and it will be one of the jewels in my bookcase. It is a tremendous way of introducing young people to poetry and is just a charming story!!! LOVE THIS BOOK!!!"
2,Love that Book!,"It's a charming, delightful, true book about 10 yo boys and poetry. My 10yo boy agrees with most of it (he's not quite as in love with poetry by the end, but he's getting there) I would recommend this to anyone with a child struggling to appreciate poetry but especially to boys. It's so loving and light filled. It's a delightful book and a real treasure. We're keeping it!"
1,Simply disappointing! I don't recommend this album to anyone!,"It seems that all the energy, the ""music stamina"" Al Jarreau had, is definitely gone. I waited until I could read all the comments on this album, then bought it. Wasted money! If you're expecting to find more of the magnificent Jazz & Pop exercises Al Jarreau did in ""Breakin' Away"", ""Jarreau"" or ""L Is For Lover"", just forget it...!!! This album is for dark-Jazz & Blues fans only. Anyway, Jarreau's voice sounds simply murky and boring."
2,Authour recreates his own life story.,"Neil Albert's ""monthly series"" continues in its 6th entery. This time Dave Garret is set out to solve a totaly different case. He is looking for his biological parents.The author states that this is based on his search for his birth parents and that brings a more human emotion to the story itself.Alberts intertwining chapters of different naratives actually gives two interesting prespectives to the same story.As the story opens we find Dave in his office with nothing to do, basicly jobless buy with a job. Until he is presued to find his father, his biological father. He sets out to California where his mother stayed during her pregnancy with her family. He hopes he will be able find the truth there but it leads to nowhere. With a twist of fate and a confession Dave is sent on the right track and you are left with a great mystery."
2,A Classic from an Early Hippie Band,"The themes of the songs may seem dated to younger listeners, but this album still holds up as the music is fun, interesting and excellent. This was one of the first Hippie bands, and therefore may sound super-outdated to young listeners today, but give it a chance; you won't be sorry. The vocals from these guys are always interesting and enjoyable, even downright beautiful. They are quirky and wonderful, as is this CD."
2,Excellent CD!,"I only recently learned about this band. This greatest hits CD contains lots of the songs played on satellite radio while I'm driving to work. Great band ! I love the singer. I only wish they were not broken up. An excellent bargain for a fan, new or old!"
2,Very good,The cd was purchased as a Christmas gift and I assume everything was fine with it. Your service was excellent and was received in a timely manner. Thank you
2,Full Poster Sized,"Nice poster for a violin teachers room. It would make a nice chart for beginners. Really everything on the chart is in your beginning books, but stuck up on the wall, it can help teach the students. This is a full sized poster, not a little chart."
1,even schwarzenegger must hope this one goes away,with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!
2,Better!,I liked this book a lot better then the previous one! I really liked how Christine really pursued God in what she should do concerning her relationship with Eric! Overall great read!
1,NOT worth 10$,"I bought this set a while ago because it looked unique and fun. Do not make the same mistake I made of buying it, it is not worth even 10$! The exercises are extremely fast paced. What I mean by this is that he will show you a move for a split second then expect you to have it mastered so while they're dancing away a million miles a minute, you're stuck there still trying to figure out how to do the moves. My other problem is when I would do the resistance disc exercises, I honestly did not feel any shape or form of a burn meaning the exercise wasn't doing ANYTHING (and to top it off, I was using the most resistant band the set came with). I wasted money on this ridiculous program, shame on BeachBody for releasing this!"
2,good product,really like this product. I would recommend this product if you are looking for this type of item for your computer needs.

1,"Good ideas, bad execution","I bought this book because it had the largest and most creative selection of recipes, but that's just not good enough.After two failures today I referred back to some ""old standards"" and discovered that the proportion of flour to liquid is different by almost 3 ounces in some cases. The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour. In one case, adding flour never did compensate for the combinations of other ingredients (chocolate and orange segments).When I read the book more closely, I discovered that the author recommends standing by during mixing to make this adjustment on all the recipes. So much for having fresh bread ready when you wake up in the morning.The author's credentials seem good, but she doesn't understand the breadmaker's approach.I suppose I'll use the ideas in this book and adjust the liquid as needed, but it certainly won't replace the recipes that I've used for the past ten years. Too bad."
2,Great Bread Machine cookbook!,"I bought this book for my son along with a bread machine. I almost kept this cookbook for myself and plan to buy one for me, too. Great variety of breads and doughs to choose from."
2,a treasure for bread lovers,"I love this book, not only does it have great solid bread machine recipes, it also has some more challengins and unique breads you can play around with. I feel it elevates bread machine baking to a more artistic level in some ways. Highly recommed this book."
2,ProKeys 88SX - the real deal,"This keyboard is a great little keyboard, 7 solid sounds, minimum frills, great price and easy to transport. I use it mainly for recording. It is not really what I would call a road-worthy board, but in a static set-up, it's perfect for me."
1,bored to death,"at school last week we watched this movie, history class. It was exteamly borning. I learned noting and only was disgusted RENT THIS FIRST, PO"
2,Definitive historical masterpiece,"If you liked 'Last of the Mohicans', 'The Mission', or 'The New World', then read on. This film is relatively unknown in the UK, and sadly does not seem to be available in Region 2. If you can play films from other regions, I urge you to buy this veritable masterpiece. The haunting scenery, understated acting, and overwhelming authentic period feel, add up to a memorable cinema experience that will stay with you. The portrayal of the savage culture of the native American Indians can be hard to watch at times but the excellent cast draw you in to the story in a way seldom seen these days. Not a blockbuster or action film, this will reward the fan of historical drama, and those who can appreciate first class cinematography and photography. Don't be put off by the 'religious' theme, it is only part of a wider view on colonisation and faith.Serious cinema for the true film buff."
1,bleh x 5!,"If someone wanted to write a book about Tolkien & Middle Earth, they should have researched a little better. Not *this* garbage! Tolkien was a CATHOLIC -- & a hard-liner at that. Catholic. Not Buddhist, not Pagan & certainly NOT Gnostic (sheesh! Some of this stuff in this book was hard to read because it was so WRONG)! Yes, he got some of his ideas from mythology (the myth part of the book is ok, I guess. But, there are so many *other* *better* books about myth out there than *this*... I know I've read better). But, the books are basically Catholic. Just read the Sil & you'll see what I mean! There's hardly *anything* in here about Tolkien's Catholic upbringing as it pertains to the books. If I want the *real* story on Tolkien & what he believed & wrote, I'll stick w/Tolkien's Letters & Joseph Pearce.I shouldn't have bought this book, but... well, I'm a sucker for anything Tolkien....."
2,Arthur enters the story line!,"Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend. This is the way Arthur really could have come to power. I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!In this book Arthur enters the story (actually, he did that at the end of the previous book, The Saxon Shore in the closing pages). This series is just brilliant. The best and most credible retelling of the Arthur legend."
1,Romance in Disguise,"When women write stories about mute girls who are saved by big, strong men who teach them to be sexually aware, that is considered Romance fiction and is looked down upon. But here we have the same formula: a mysterious young girl, beautiful and abused, unable to speak. A hero of mythical proportions comes to her rescue. Cassandra never felt real to me, because the author never lets her speak -- just another female character to manipulate and show the hero off to advantage.Historical fiction and historical detail are good things, when there are real characters to hold them up, and a real story to listen to. This book seesaws between long and tedious discussions of theology and Danielle Steele."
1,American TV in 1944? Heh-heh-heh!,"This WIN PRODUCTIONS DVD is curious and highly suspect.There was no AMOS 'N' ANDY TV show in 1944, nor did Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (pictured here all corked up) appear in the early 50s television sitcom. (Amos Jones was played by Alvin Childress and Andy 'Hogg' Brown was Spencer Williams.)The three episodes divided into parts on this item's Editorial Review (""Invisible Glass,"" ""The Gun"" and ""Kingfish Gets Drafted"") are single-episode programs that run 25 minutes each. As for ""the best episodes of Amos & Andy,"" that's a matter of opinion. They're typical A&A; shows, to be sure.I doesn't know 'bout dis one, Andy!"
1,"I am missing something, right?","So this is a ""London Times Funny Music Cartoons"" mousepad that features Barry Gibb of laying on a psychiatrist's sofa quoting the beginning lyrics to....""I Started A Joke""???. But Barry doesn't sing a single note on the song which everyone knows is pretty much a Robin Gibb solo, so the selection of this lyric for this cartoon makes no sense. Clearly the artist was not very knowledgeable about the subject they were rendering a cartoon about. And oh yeah- how is this cartoon funny? I know the lyrics make no sense (many early Bee Gees lyrics don't), but how is this cartoon funny? The London Times actually published this at one time (I guess it was a slow news day. And now some 20 years later, I would want this cartoon as a mousepad because why?? Oh- and the actual lyric in the word balloon is wrong too."
1,Good Film Bad Version,"This is sad, because as much as i love this film, i must give it one star. This is probably because of the DVD. This film is cut and censored. My point is the 2 most famous parts (The fetus eating and the eating of the organs) have been completly cut out. I think this was due to the rush of companies to get there movies on DVD. I should have known better when i didnt see the name Anthropopaguhs anywere on the box. Tisa Farrow is so hot and we should really get to see alot more of her in this movie (its done by Joe D'Amato the soft-core gore guy who did Ilsa and Emanuell films and we dont see any nudity at all in this film). I have the uncut version, the sequal Absurd and the lesser more cheap tribute and/or remake Anthropopagus 2000. Wait a while, im sure this will come out uncut some day..."
2,its okay,"Just remember when you buy this book that it's from Microsoft Press, so expect it to lean towards supporting the Microsoft Internet Explorer, with plenty of plugs accordingly - so some of the techiques in this book will not work on the Netscape browser - but these are clearly marked as such, so there shouldn't be any confusion. It comes with a CD ROM which helps you see what you are reading about and comes with a version of the MSIE that you can download. Its nice and easy to read and 'EVEN I' can understand it all"
1,Aggressive Defense of Marriage,"The Tender Trap is one of the most aggressive defenses of marriage ever seen in the movies. Carefree Frank Sinatra is bullied by depressed married friend David Wayne into leaving his happy bachelor life for the supposed solidity of married life. Frank is eventually roped by control-freak Debbie (""I don't care who I marry as long as I'm married by 22"") Reynolds into a presumably happily ever after married future. A depressing movie that is barely redeemed by sympathetic performances by Sinatra and Celeste Holm. David Wayne's portrayal of a self-absorbed, cruel detached husband is o.k. in a thankless role. Debbie Reynold's character is truly frightening."
2,Simply Fantastic...,"Radical Cure is the first book I've read by Olivia Gates...but, cetainly not my last. I'll be grabbing up her backlist asap!The previous reviews already provide the background for this book... I'll just add that this is an edgy, fast-paced, action-packed novel. I wouldn't limit it to a ""medical thriller"".Calista St. James is a smart, strong, capable woman and sparks fly when she is with Damian De Luna, a smart, sexy, capable man. The author not only writes intelligent 3-D characters, but she knows how to turn up the heat between these two.I think this book can be read as a stand-alone book, but I have already placed my order for Strong Medicine."
2,Another Great Book-To-Movie,"One of my all-time favorites. Great locations, timeless story, excellent production values, and of course, a marvelous cast. No actor is mis-cast. The film never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental, though in another director's hand that might have happened. It simply tells the story the way Conrad told it.My DVD library won't be complete until this is added to it. When will it be released on DVD?"
2,Superb Sequel!,"If you liked the first volume of Cinema Serenade, you will love this one. It features beautiful, lush arrangements and Perlman's always gorgeous playing. This record is also exquisitely engineered and the balance between the Pops and Perlman is perfect. You want this recording."
1,Star Trek: Gateways Book One - One Small Step,This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!
2,Life is just an edless waltz,"Endless waltz is an awsome movie. the special edition DVD includes the OVA episiodes of the movie, it also includes a mobel suit encyclopedia and is veiwable in mutiple languages. It has the same voices as in the show(english version anyways). If you saw this on the cartoon network or YTV(people in canada), then you might have thought that it was very heavly edited, the truth is that it wasn't. sure commercials but thats about it. BUT, if you only saw it once, than you probobly didn't catch it all at once. Its a great DVD packed with loads of stuff that will make this a great movie from begining to end."
1,GRAND,"I watched the movie on Cartoon Network about two years ago. It's an excellent movie, I tell you. It's facinating!!! ^_^I loved the characters and their personalities. I seriously loved the art designs animation. It brings out the true life of the movie. In my opinion, this DVD is great! You should get this DVD and soon. It ROCKS! ^_^!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This is not a bad product, at all. As with most camping equipment, a lower price means lower quality. If you purchase this item knowing this, then you won't be disappointed. The grill is not all that tall, so you have to let the fire burn down to coals before putting this over it. We used it mostly to hold up a small propane stove to allow for better air circulation underneath, and it worked spectacularly for that!"
2,Eternal Truth,"These reflective,honest and wholly recitable poems are an endless delight.Who can argue with their truths?Maybe the (...) moral prig who will be a millennia dead and forgotten while the eternal Omar shines a light of realness and honesty in a world full of flowers and forests loving nitwit poets and poeple (...) who insist that life only be seen through the view of his religion.Go read the nonsensical,idiotic,mystical blather of Rumi if you want your poets ""spiritual"".If you have taste, read Khayyam. Grade:A+"
1,Torture,"When Marvin Mange is involved in a fatal car accident, he is brought back to life as half man half animal. With his newly formed animal features, we are expected to laugh at the gags that happen as a result. But all these gags do is attempt to make the viewer less intelligent. This film heavily relies on toilet humour and it's target audience seems to be aimed at younger kids. Are adults really expected to laugh at this low class humour? If we do, we should be ashamed of ourselves!Utter tripe."
2,The Animal (Uncut Special Edition),rob's funny and it can sometimes not be funny but over all it's a great laugh.
2,Schneider does it again!,If you've seen Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and liked Rob Schneider's performance (no pun intended) as much as I did - then you'll love The Animal! Same kind of goofy humor. Will definitely be buying this on DVD when it's released.
2,Listen to it again,"When I first heard this album, I was thinking...um, no. But I listened to it a few times more (being a fan) and discovered its greatness. Now, not every track is great, but those that are make up for the others. I found it has a really great retro-80's sound that I hear others trying to produce, but didn't hit the mark like this one did."
2,In My Opnion,"J.R.R. Tolken is an amazing writer, with such enchanting lands and exciting adventures it is hard not to get wrapped up in his books and never put them down."
1,boring!!!!,most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux
1,I only put 1 star so people would read this :-),"Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning"
2,"The Two Towers, The best book ever!","The two towers is an awesome book. The fellowship has now broken into three groups, and the book follows the whereabouts and events of Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have been captured by the relentless Uruk-Hai and escape into Fangorn Forest. Frodo and Sam are hopelessly trying to fufill their quest to destroy the ring with the deceitful Gollum as their guide. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are tracking the captured hobbits in Fangorn Forest when Gandalf returns to them. They all make for Edoras and heal the bewitched king Theoden. After retreating to the fortress of Helm's Deep, Aragorn leads the battle to make a final stand...This is a fantastic book that i recommend to readers ages 14 and up. There is a lot going on a one time that might be hard for younger kids to understand. I had to read the series over again to make sure i understood."
2,The Heart of ot All,"We return to Middle- Earth in <u>Return of the King<u/>, the last book in <u>The Lord of The Rings<u/> trilogy. With the Fellowship already broken and parted, Frodo and Sam struggle deep in the heart of Mordor to the fires of Mount Doom. Sam begins to lose heart as Frodo falls deeper and deeper into the power of the One Ring. Aragorn comes to fully understand that as Isildur's air, he must take up the throne in Gondor. All throughout this journey, Sauron, the enemy of the people of Middle- Earth, feels his need for the One Ring growing. He will do anything to get it back, even kill the Ring- bearer.J.R.R Tolkien has created a masterpiece! You can feel the emotion and action of every event in this thriller. If you've read <u>The Fellowship of the Ring<u/> and <u>The Two Towers<u/>, I strongly advise you tie up the trilogy with this incredible journey. This book is very inspiring."
2,Wonderful Storytelling. Worthy Tolkien Novel.,"In the Second Volume of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story of Gimli, Legolas, Sam, and Frodo's sojourn to destroy the One Ring of Power continues. Wonderful character contrast between the flighty and angelic Elven creature Legolas, and his stout hearted dwarven companion Gimli. Engrossing universe of magic and lore that is worthy of Tolkien's talents."
2,Ella and Louis,"Now this one is a no-brainer:EVERYBODY knows by now how great idea was teaming Ella (at her peak) and Louis (close enough to his peak) on this album,with a killer back-up group lead by Oscar Peterson at his rhythmiest (yes, I know it's not a real word). I'm writing about the original CD from the early 2000s I bought, not about SACD (where the review will apparently, also end up), so I can't talk about the technological finesse of this edition... I'm just claiming this is a beautiful jazz album, happily matched only byElla and Louis Again, another masterpiece. Groveling expressiveness of Louis' voice is matched beautifully with the melodic brilliance of Ella's jubilant voice and the rest is history."
2,not so bad,"although i would have to say not my fav movie of all time, it's not all that bad..many folks might enjoy it and for [the price]what a steal!!! i think you see adam sandler in a different light (kinda like jim carey in the majestic....not so moranic...ps i do love little nicky). the kinda look at the camera, documentry style is cool and if you love nostalgia...not enough said 'bout the milton berle appearence....a must see"
1,crummy crummy crummy,this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
1,Ouch This Movie Hurts,I had to write this review to counterbalance all the faked 5 star reviews. I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film. The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched. Outside of that this movie is a train wreck. The plot is a waste of time. The acting is over the top and hammy. On of the most egregious parts is the sound. The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing. Beware the casual movie goer won't be swayed by girls in bikinis.
1,I wish no stars were an option,"I believe catching every disease on earth at once would be more pleasant than watching this movie. It's not even worth a penny, which is probably how much they spent making this film. Save yourself time, money, sanity and I.Q. points RUN AWAY!"
1,I had no other choice but to read this book.,"This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage."
2,good movie.,My daughter was doing a report on Christa McAuliffe. We rented this after she had done her report. She enjoyed actually seeing how the space program worked.
2,END OF ONE SERIES AND ACTUAL START OF ANOTHER,"Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them. If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again. Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work. Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy. Recommend highly."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I got this book as a gift and still think it was a waste of money. Every dream I have looked up so far was negative, most dealing w/ some future pending event, ie if you dream 'X' you are soon to lose your job or some other misfortune. How a dream relates to some future event in the physical world I'll never know. I was hoping it would deal more w/ what's going on in my subconscious, but that doesn't seem to be what this book is about."
1,Not a good Kindle edition,"Unfortunately, this Kindle version is missing almost all of the illustrations, which are an integral part of the book. And the poetry is not formatted correctly and is in red on my iPad Kindle.Through the Looking Glass [Kindle Edition] by BLTC is the one you want."
2,Alice's BIG Adventures in Wonderland,"I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."
1,Only Two Stars for the Penguin Edition,"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."
1,In the Rabbit Hole,"This is not a pretty edition. For a serviceable edition just to read the wonderful words of these stories and to have them together, it's ok. The printing is dense and the quality of the paper is poor. The price is great. Not for a gift. Teresa"
1,get a magnifying glass,"I was super sad when this book arrived :( The print was sooooo small that no one wanted to read it. When purchasing the book on Amazon there was no ""preview"" of the pages or inside of the book. I guess that I learned my lesson. I ended up purchasing a different Alice's Adventures In Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass book so that we could read a book that had larger print. I was not happy with this book, and would not recommend it to anyone if you enjoy ""normal"" size print. This was really tiny!!!!!The book arrived in good shape and the shipping was satisfactory."
2,Not Just a Beloved Children's Book!,"This book is a delight to both young and old, and as many times as I've read it or had it read to me, I still love the story. For one thing the characters are unforgettable. Who can forget the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee and the Mad Hatter? There are so many adaptations of this book and so many varied ways to enjoy it, that there is perhaps a danger that it may be overused. I think though that it is best enjoyed read in a book since that is where the imagination can take over and make the book something magical. Take the time to reread this great classic. It's well worth it."
1,Where is the Looking Glass?,"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. I already have ""Alice"", and for free. This edition claims Looking Glass in its title, but only includes Alice. Do not be fooled. Get Alice for free and skip this misleading version."
2,alice in wonderland,this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!
1,Too little technique too much speculation and opinion,"With phrases like ""Because extreme physical regimens like bodybuilding are so unhealthy, a completely new medical specialty - sports medicine - has been developed in recent years,"" Griner dishes many opinions in the form of medical fact. His cause and effects are often speculative or down right incorrect. Sure, his technique works, but he writes about too many topics in which he has not been schooled."
2,Very Excellent,"This game is a must if you like first person 3d shooter. Quake provides a wide variety of game play. The multiplayer aspect of the game makes it worth playing over and over. There are many mods (modifacations) that you can add on for extra and different game play. Team Fortress, which is by far the most popular mod, is the most fantastic multiplayer game out there that I've played. Also for those of you who are nerds, Quake II multiplayer actually shrinks the players and makes you think that the levels are actually bigger. :)"
1,not the first choice,"Getz other Bossa Nova album's are classics. Start with the delightful ""Getz/Gilberto"", the second best selling Jazz CD of all time, then ""Jazz Samba"", ""Jazz Samba Encore"". But by the time Norm Grantz at Verve pushed him into this, he was pretty tired of Samba.""Chenga de Saudade"" is definitely the best and ""Niote Triste"" is pleasant but this type of big band highly-scripted format wasn't his forte. It's Stan, so he's (almost) never bad, he puts on a brave face and does the best under the circumstances.Inoffensive, but quite Pop and shallow.Make sure you have the other albums above before you get this one.Sorry they can't all be great. Tryin' to save you money."
2,Great read!,"This was my first Stuart Woods book. It has a great pace, keeps you interested and gets you involved with characters. I definitely recommend it."
2,Stan and Ollie in the Trenches,"Fully restored to its original 68-minute length, Laurel and Hardy's second starring feature holds up surprisingly well. ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" (1932) remains among the team's most enjoyable efforts, with several classic routines and an excellent supporting cast. Stan and Ollie are a pleasure to watch in this offbeat World War I comedy-drama. Look for a cameo by director George Marshall as the vengeful cook."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Definitely in the bottom five. The screen play strains to include the well-known historical points of its subject into the film in the most ham-fisted and contrived ways in an attempt to build a feature film length linear story. It fails heroically. The skeleton story is padded out with fabricated hokum, Hollywood star turns by Warren Beatty in possibly his most annoying performance ever, and gratuitous violence galore. If ever there was a must-miss it's this pile of garbage."
1,A let down,"The Simple Minds (a brass band in african chimes) and Mansun (wide open space) tracks are super, as are, of course, the two Chicane tracks (which can be found on Far From The Maddening Crowds). Otherwise, I'm really hard pressed to recommend any other tracks. Not recommended."
1,Slow and amateurish,Poorly done and as stated quite amateurish. It simply did not get moving and finally turned it off. If it got any better I'd be surprised.
1,boring,"Movie was very boring, not what i expected. The movie does not have much to offer. Overall I would not recommend this movie."
2,"A ""Must Have"" for college dorm rooms","We have 4 kids and got our first Hot Shot when they all lived at home. We love it and use it almost everyday. It became the ""must have"" for college item as each of them went off to college over the last 7 years. We just bought the last one for our youngest who is going to college this fall. We've also bought them for graduation gifts for friends and general family gifts - they are greatly appreciated and used. Wish Amazon would buy these in bulk and make them available for free shipping ; )"
1,This guide sucks,"After ascertaining that this was the best market guide for me to purchase in order to get my novel published I gladly ordered it. Well, they don't include a great deal of reputable literary agents (who are constantly in the trades). Example: Trident Media, ICM, William Morris-even Gloria Loomis (Walter Mosley's agent---and he wrote an intro article ""Connecting with the rest of the world through words"" on page 6 (!!!). In addition they don't even list major Science-Fiction awards, the Hugo and Nebula-what else are they missing. I feel robbed. Then to make matters worse, I went to their website to complain (filled out their form) and got a bounce back that said, ""This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification. Delivery to the following recipients failed. anneb@fwpubs.com""LAME!!!"
1,piece of garbage,"I bought mine almost 1 year ago, trying to improve my old (but good) Dell Axim X5, and after using the warranty 4 times, (because the one I bought was overheating when it was Off) first they replaced the battery, then the equipment (twice) and the IPaQs continue overheating, with no technical explanation from HP. Now they offered me an ""Improvement"" to my original choice (the IPaQ 210) but these guys are so smart that sent me only the new IPaQ (210) with no battery, cables, Installation CD, stylus, etc. (the 2795 and the 210 are quite differents in the accessories) this was almost 1 month ago and they are still playing games with me. Conclusion: after 1 year of purchasing the IPaQ I could use it properly around 1 month. My worst experience as Client.... I will go back to DELL."
2,Had to send it back!,"I really like the product, its way smaller that I thought, 2 reason i had to send it back, 1. dead pixel, 2. had to reset 3 times in one hour. i dont know wat the heck is wrong with it. it doesnt support kingstore secure digital card, (4gb), otherwise the lcd is cristal clear, has wifi internet which is preety amazing, fast, i didnt get to see everything yet cuz i shiped it back the same day i got it, hope the one i am getting now comes with no diffects."
2,Good,"Three CD set of piano music.Long,austere improvisations remindingrenaissance organ playing.The Second Part is especially fine.Recommended!"
1,Quality could be better,It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
2,Best Music Video Ever!!!,This is a video that you will want to watch over & over & over - and love every time. Absolutely the best music video ever made.
1,wasted money,"I am restricted to a wheelchair, and so must rely on grabbers,to assist me when reaching for things in higher areas or across wide spacess. I already had one of the ergonomically 18' grabbers in this style and really liked the light wt. and dexterity it allowed me, over many of the other styles. So, I was very disappointd when after the THIRD time I used it, I heard a click and part of the internal workings actually came through the handle, Now, it just takes up space while I try to see if I can get my money back. Needless to say, I am aggeivated and dissapointd. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Desert Island Essential,"I have made a gift of this album to a number of my friends. If I had to pick only 10 pieces of music ever, this would be my first choice. Timeless, elegant, soulful, spiritual, dark, sad, silent!"
1,IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT SPYING,"This is not an espionage thriller as the cover and title of this book would have you beleive. The vast majority of the content in this book is about how two people working in the CIA fall in love with each other and how they are so excited being around one another. I for one, and i think most people would agree, think that someone who would buy this book would be interested in the CIA and the history of the cold war. This book has nearly nothing to do with either of those subjects! Their are some good parts to this book but they are overshadowed by a love story. This book would be better catogorized as a romance novel!"
1,"Poorly written love story, good spy story","This book needed an editor. I felt as if the authors were trying to increase their page count by putting in way too many descriptors about things that didn't need describing.The love story is ridiculous. It is forced into the narrative like a square peg in a round hole. I skipped all the things about ""our eyes met, and I felt myself blush"" etc. Come on Jonna, you are a master of disguise and you can't disguise the fact that you slept with your boss the night before?The spy story is interesting, although lacking some details understandably to protect on-going missions.A beach read."
1,Poorly Written with Virtually No Story Line to Follow,"WOW....I never thought a publishing house would allow a book to be published without having an editor read it first. The authors desperately needed to employ a ghostwriter for assistance.The story line is almost impossible to follow, the personal references to their ""love story"" are dull and self-serving and they left out significant and I might add, much required details of operations, planning and ending results all that made this book a real time (and money) waster.The storyline, billed as a look behind secret spy techniques and operations, has in reality, little to do about spying, operations, the Cold War or the CIA. You can learn more from a bad James Bond movie. The other review recommending it be classified as a romance novel is correct. This book seems to have been written as a personal memoir not for mass consumption."
2,Hilariously slanted look at history,"This movie is great! Highly entertaining, especially for those of us who even know what Watergate was. Though young at the time, this movie brought the times back in a hilarious fashion. I'm suprised at how many kids in school today have never even heard of Watergate. Maybe this funny look at a twisted history will cause them to look back. Oh yeah, great soundtrack. Peace man!"
1,Whatever you do don't waste your money on this movie,"Me and my friends rented this movie even though we'd never heard of it. All I have to say is it was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This movie was terrible. I'm a fan of Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek but she destroyed any credibility that she had by starring in this movie. The movie was supposed to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny about it. We were so bored that we didn't even finish it. We had to turn it off it was too terrible to finish. Whatever you do don't put yourself through the torture of having to see this movie."
2,Keeps you laughing,"Well you don't have to be a history buff to get the gags in this movie. Both lead actresses have that ditzy, aloof girl next door routine done pat and this along with the situations they accidently find themselves in makes for one heck of a re-watchable movie. I usually love DVD's that have enough content to last 10 or more viewings and this definately one of them. There are plenty of jokes or play on the word ' Dick ' in this movie and that alone is good enough to last for multiple viewings. I'm not a history buff, but you don't have to be to get how ' Walnut Leaves ' could have re-written the history books...There's to much to this movie to explain, just buy its money well spent."
1,Love Ella; didn't love this CD,"This was a very jazzy album and just seemed to try too hard. I know singers must get tired of singing the same type of songs, but I didn't enjoy this one at all and gave it away. Didn't even want to keep it for my Christmas collection."
2,Something's happening here....,"A haunting, mysterious and magical movie. Marjorie Cameron adds an element of real life magic. Kenneth Anger also had done this when he used her in `The Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954)'. Marjorie Easton also adds to the spell, and Dennis Hopper is wonderful. The carnival is the perfect background for a a plot about fantasy and reality. Filmed at the Santa Monica Pier, Venice and Ocean Park, California, where Anton LaVey played organ at strip joints in the late 1940's. The name Mora is found in many parts of the world as the death aspect of the `Triple Goddess', or Night Mare, or female vampire."
1,Good as paper weight,"Never been able to sync with computer, battery consistently deteriorated and now, 12 months after I bought it and despite the minimal use (as it does not connect with PC its use is very limited), battery has now completely died and can only use it when connected to AC.HP assistance is useless - suggested to assist me purchase a new one - right, not in a million years.Not impressed by product or by HP. Had a Dell before which worked flawlessly for years. Decided to 'upgrade' to HP. I wish Dell were still making their Pocket PCs to replace this useless and expensive device."
1,does not live up to promise,"A cute book, but contains very little information for all of its promise. The authors are busy making jokes but not talking about the nitty gritty of restoration. Maybe it is to hard to do since every job presents its own challanges. I just found the content thin. I am sorry I purchased it. If I could have found a copy in my local library, I would have saved some money."
1,More motivational than substantive,"Although the book covers quite a bit in its 250-some pages, it lacks serious substance. While it motivates those in the administrative field to take charge and harbor an invincible positive attitude, it offers little direction or guidance beyond that. Noted in the Acknowledgements that the book was a 35-year work in progress, it shows. Many sections seem brief or entirely cut off with no direction or conclusion and the book flits through sections with no clear path. There's a lot of build up and no real answers to the questions that plague those in this profession. The entire book left me wanting to know more, but not giving me a whole lot I didn't already know."
1,RCBS 130,"I have not used it yet. I tried to balance the scale to zero, but I can't seem to keep it zeroed. The unit is mainly plastic and very light weight. At this point, I'm not impressed."
1,Worst movie ever,The acting and the script for this aAlfred Hitchcock movie are horrible. Save your money and order one of his later movies.
1,The 39 Steps,"The VHS tape was inpossible to watch. I tried it on 2 different playback machines that were in perfect working condition and played other tapes just to see if the problem was in the machine or the tapes. I found that the problem was only with the 39 Steps, the tape I had just purchased.The speed of the tape was intermittant, that is is started out running too fast, changed back to a normal speed and then would speed up again. It was not possible to adjust the tracking ( on either of the two players I tried). I had hoped to send the tape as a present to a friend who is interested in old Alfred Hitchcock movies, but had to junk it instead. I ended up purchasing another version of the movies in DVD format from Amazon ( that was was perfect) to send to my friend.This was the first item that I have purchased through Amazon with which I was not pleased.The 39 Steps [VHS]"
1,BE CAREFUL - ONLY BUY CRITERION EDITION,"If you don't get the Criterion Edition, you will be getting an inferior transfer of this film: fuzzy images, fuzzier sound...yuck! The ""bad"" transfers include the one that Tony Curtis introduces.Again, look for the Criterion Edition."
1,Deep,"This is a very hard read, very deep and one must truly truly be alone on an island to read this book"
1,Ugggg...,"I'm all for reading soul-searching materials, but this book was like pulling teeth - I felt it was translated (and poorly at that) so the sentence structure was long and difficult to follow; NOT that word choice was difficult or that it was above reading comprehension, far from it...some of the sentences just didn't make sense and I often lost their entire meaning."
2,The Power in Metaphors,"Estes has provided a great service to us all by preserving and interpreting these archetypal stories that pass on the wisdom of the generations that precede us with regard to living, loving, rites of passage, and dying. Second only to Joseph Campbell's work (The Power of Myth) in it's power to explain many of the facets of our lives. As equally valuable to men as to women."
2,Beloved,"I read the book first, but then listened to the audio, (a gift from a boyfriend that new how much I LOVED Women Who Run With the Wolves), and was delighted to discover not only Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes youthful, pretty, and encouraging voice, but also new stories and commentary that were not in the book! For those who have not discovered Dr. Clarissa Pinkola-Estes and her vast collection of audio, I wonder if they will feel the connection to their souls as I instantly feel a connection to my soul each time I read her words and hear her voice. A priceless gift to oneself, a priceless gift for a loved one."
1,Prysock vs. Harvey,"I ended up here because I was trying to see if Laurence Harvey's version of This Is My Beloved is available on CD. Alas, it does not appear to be. I am one of the lucky ones who ran across another vinyl of it a few years ago many years after losing my first copy and am listening to it as I write. As much as I love Arthur Prysock's voice, no one can TOUCH Harvey's version of this book and I have both! I would suggest checking stores that specialize is used/out of print albums for Harvey's version. No disrespect to Prysock, but you'll never listen to it the same way again!"
2,great for what i do,This toy is great for customization as well as overall playing... I'm actually going to get another one just so I can customize an Ice cream van out of it... I recommend getting this if you customize toys... or as a gift for your kids
2,Standard Breakfast,"I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling, taste is excellent. Good to take along when you're late for work as I usually am. A great all around breakfast. I like mine warmed up in the Microwave."
2,Good Stuff,"It was because of the other graphic novel based in Arkham Asylum that I heard of this one. Sure enough, they are different. ""Arkham Asylum: Living Hell"" is definitely a most enjoyable book. The text is good, the drawing style is nice, and if you're Batman baddies, you'll find plenty.You'll see very little of Batman in there. The story is entirely based in Arkham and focuses on a new inmate in there, and various subplots involving other inmates, the classical Batman villains.I can't compare with other books based on Batman, because I only read one, but I sure can say this book is an enjoyable read."
2,Almost perfect Batman book,"From the start I was enthralled. The art, the story, the atmosphere all had me captivated. I really enjoyed the drama tone Living Hell had. It didn't start out with a sense of action/adventure but more of a serious prison drama. It definitely had action especially towards the end but for the most part it was a drama about one guy who got stuck in Arkham Asylum.Other reviewers were also disappointed with the way the book turned out in the last chapter and I have to agree with them. It wasn't what I was expecting and all the while I was reading it I was kind of discouraged. But once I got to the last few pages I was like, ""This totally rocks!"". In my opinion it made up for all the ""weirdness"" that was in the last chapter.Overall It wasn't as psychological as Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth but it gave a good feel for what life is like at Arkham Asylum."
1,should have gone with another flavor,DId not like the chocolate oatmeal raisin. wasnt very tasty. It is filling and wholesome but I would not buy again at this price.
1,Not worth watching--nothing Keaton put out really is and maybe never was,Like so many of Keaton's films it is more fun to wish you could watch them than it is to actually tune in.This film has one novelty only--the ship looks expensive. Beyond thet its as worthless as Keaton's cheap short films (of which there are two on this DVD). The films all usually have very little intelligence in scripts (though Battling Butler was almost a smart Keaton movie). The sets look like they cost about 50 bucks to make (on the shorts and almost every last one of his long films ---this movie only looks grand mostly because of the passenger ship--the sub at the end looks like a $10 prop set). Why did anybody think so many would want to warm up to this loser of an actor called Buster?
2,it works,"what more do you need to know. Only 4 Stars because the unit responds a bit slowly to the remote control, but I don't think that's because it has been chipped; it's a design fault from Toshiba. Unit plays all region dvds with no fussing around. and the price is right."
2,Three women reflect on sandplay,"If you've wondered what sandplay was all about from a Kalffian/Jungian perspective, these three women have a lot of wisdom to impart. Beyond ""beginning sandplay"" texts which provide a basic introduction to sandplay, this volume explores the essentials of sandplay while also going into depth about salient topics such as silence, the numinous, Self, and chaos. Based on conversations between these three elders of sandplay, similiarities and differences have been teased out to create a rich tapesty of the potential growth and healing inherent in sandplay. I highly recommend this book."
1,Good product bad deal,"this is being sold for 5-8 dollars on most of the internet. word to the wise, buy this somewhere else."
1,Didnt work for me,"I used the pest control product for cloth moths. I placed several of these around my house, 1 in each closet, ect., but none of the 8 traps have caught any moths yet. Its been several weeks since I put these out in my house. I would recommend trying just one box, and see how that works for you. I unfortunately ordered several boxes at once hoping it would help, but so far, these havent caught any moths yet, but every coule days I see one or two still flying around the house."
1,"DOES NOT WORK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY",This products is terrible and ineffective. We placed several around our home and only caught 1-2 moths in each. Get the pantry moth trap in the red and yellow pack. It is wonderful. Moths multiply so quickly that you need a powerful attracting mechanism to get rid of them.
2,Safer pantry pest trap,"After buying these traps in a local hardware store, I found them online at a reduced rate. They worked very well initially and did help to stop the cycle with the Pheromone attraction. But the pheromone seems to wear out in ten days. not weeks. However, that said, these simple easy traps took my home out of being moth infested, to having a few here and there. I recommend them highly."
1,Safer moth traps no longer work,I had been using Pantry Pest traps successfully for years. Recent purchases haven't worked at all! I will not buy them again.
1,Safer Pantry Pest Trap,"I was unimpressed by this product. When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused. Most flew near the trap, but less than 10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part. The rest just kept flying around the kitchen. I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results. I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside."
2,Works but don't depend on it to rid the moths,"We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap, nothing happened for like 2-3 days and we would manually swat the moths. Later it managed to catch 15-20 of these. But it would not attract all of them. We still had to go after them with brooms etc."
1,Did not do the job,The Pantry Pest did not work. The sticky adhesive missed most of the moths!! I actually trapped a moth in the triangle and it hit the sides of the trap--nothing! It bounced off them like it was super moth!! The lure is tiny and did not attract many moths. I would try other things first before buying this.
1,This product does not seem to be working!,"I picked this product up at my local Ace Hardware store. I had high hopes for these traps, but they simply aren't working. The lure seems to work, but I haven't found one moth in either trap and they have been in place for three days now. The moths do fly around the traps and walk inside only to come right back out. I don't know if there is a problem with the glue or not (I didn't want to test it by touching it and compromising the product), but I do see tiny flecks of something on the glue pads. It's very frustrating to be out the money for these traps since they don't seem to be working. It's even more frustrating to see the moths still flying around."
2,Pantry moths and larvae,"Found product to be effective. However, it will take at least three weeks to start seeing results.We had a moderate infestation."
2,"So far, so good... but found elsewhere for less $$$!","Put it in my pantry tonight, and it caught 2 moths within 15 minutes, so something is working!That being said, I actually bought this at Home Depot for only $5.78+tax! This really casts doubt on Amazon's claim that the list price is $11.11 ..."
1,A dancer,"Based on the reviews that were available last year, I bought this DVD, but I'm disappointed. I was expecting it to ""dancier"" than it is, and something about the production quality bothers me."
2,Nina the Torch Chanteuse--Highly Recommended,"Nina's voice is like no other vocalist--the emotional intensity she brings to her covers and originals are non-pareleil. This ""After Hours"" CD (formerly on Philips, now Verve) is probably the best one that shows Nina in a ""torch-chanteuse"" mode. It is my co-favorite alongside the Jazz Masters on Verve. Nina's voice was at a creative peak. Each song stands out from the next. One could play this CD 1,000 times and never get tired. Each time the listener discovers new depth and meaning in Nina's singing. I prefer Nina during this mid-60's period to her later stint at RCA when she became too blues-oriented and political."
1,"If only I could vote ""0 Stars""","I am continually disappointed in Boy George. He has such potential, yet puts out what is in my opinion, pure crap. The songs on this album are dreadful. The lyrics are embarassingly poor and the music is the same bad glam rock as his last full album (which should have been scrapped with the out takes this album consists of). Boy George has done some brilliant vocals when put in the hands of producers like Faithless and the Pet Shop Boys, and his latest singles ""When Will You Learn"", and ""Love Is Leaving"". I was hoping he would release an album in that vein. In my opinion, Boy George should stick with electronics and dance music, and leave the the guitars in his garage."
1,I don't know anyone in this book!,"Ok, having now finished the book, I am still giving it two stars. I still didn't know any of the characters in this book, but it leaves off with a major cliffhanger. The descriptions in this book are many and varied, the technical stuff is very technical and the descriptions about the people and their culture is very skimpy, especially about the Blood. I would've like to known more about this culture and what makes it tick, and why the Federation is out there in this area.Thanks for reading!~Pandora"
2,mexican way,"Well, this is in my opinion the best period of Mahalia's carrer (1955). Her voice is still strong and too expressive. The songs let her ""touch"" us in a special way. It's a good oportunity for young people to listen the background's soul singers."
1,"Not DTS, Not even a good picture","I have learned a big lesson through the purchase of this video, some groups will show their fans respect and give them DTS with high quality video. Not the case here. This is simply a VHS version recorded to DVD. Not to brag but I could have done this in my basement and produced better quality. If you do not believe me, purchase this DVD then purchase the The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. I guarantee you will want you money back."
1,could have been better,"THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF, BUT DIE HARD FANS THE ONLY VIDEOS THAT ARE EXCITING ARE HUMANS BEINGS AND THE LIVE DREAMS, NOTHING ELSE IS RARE , THAT YOU HAVENT RECORDED A 1000'S TIMES OFF MTV. THERS A LOT MISSING INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS DREAMS VIDEO AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS (NOTABLY 111). GEEZ THEY COULD OF PUT ON SOME OLD LIVE VH STUFF, TO BE INTERESTING OR HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS.TIMES LIKE THESE I WISH I WAS A KISS OR BONJOVI FAN , THEY GET MULTIPLE VIDEOS WITH EACH ALBUMS, AND SEEM TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THEM .SINCE DAVE LEFT THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS DIED."
2,"Please, let get it right.","First, this is a great DVD collection of some truly amazing Van Halen stuff. It's only an hour long, but the collection is a very well thought out and executed program, chronologically tracing their musical career, and spanning through all three lead vocalists: David Lee Roth, Sammy Hagar, and Gary Cherone.But I've got a bone to pick with other reviewers - come on, there's got to be some people out there that know what they're talking about. Everyone needs to stop abusing Gary Cherone. He is a truly talented singer, well worthy of the company he keeps. Van Halen III bombed for a lot of reasons, but as we all know, it's easiest to blame the lead vocalist - look at your own band. These people need to listen to Pornograffitti. Then I'll take their Cherone opinion with more interest. I mean look at the shoes he had to fill. I'm truly glad that he didn't try to sound like Hagar and Roth, and sounded like Cherone. That in itself commands a lot of respect."
2,I blurted out laughing so many times!! Mama Ruby is Madea,"The narrator did such a fantastic job with bringing all the characters to life. The book is off the hook! Terrifying and funny at the same time. The story is crazy and makes me think about history. I sure hope people didn't live like this for real but I am sure they did. Mama Ruby thinks that satan is a low down, black, funky dog who has the strength of 10 bulls! This is the real life Tyler Perry's Madea."
2,Pam's Opinion on The Upper Room,I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my 1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend.
2,**** EXCELLENT PAGE TURNER******,"This book was so captivating!!! It kept my attention right from the start. I could not put the book down! I stayed up late at night and had to force myself to put it down, I wanted to finish it in one sitting it was so good. You really feel the pain for the main character Annette, how she was abused and ostracized by her classmates,her being protective of her mother, and her relationship with Rhoda her best friend. The author really knows how to tell a story, I highly recommend this book!!! I can't wait for Mary Monroe to write some more novels. I thoroughly enjoyed this book ...you will too!!!"
1,Returned. Way too specific for my needs.,"I'm a coach for an after school girls group that trains for a 5K at the end of a 12 week program. I'm a school counselor, NOT a trained coach or PE teacher. I wanted some general advice about helping my elementary girls prepare for the 5K, hydration needs, Pre race meals, etc. This was waaaaaay too specific for me and not helpful in my case."
1,"Smiley, Cheer Up!","Not to worry, President Bush will be re-elected in November and, I'm sure, will continue to tickle you pink with grammatical goofs. Afganistan and Irag are progressing toward democracy and you'll still be able to cash your government entitlements. Saddam Hussein has been captured but you personally are free to bash christians in our country. The U.S. will continue to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth but you'll continue to be free to advocate its takeover by the U.N. All of this should make you happy!"
2,maximum WHO,"In my opinion, ""The Kids are Alright"" it the best rock documentary ever. And that's because as originally presented, the material it covers and the way it handles the material is expert, right on the button, smoothly flowing, exciting, and informative, explosive stuff.But then, what happens? Well, if your music/rock-music appreciation is worth its salt at all, you want more, and in the case of the WHO, much, much more. And that's exactly what you get in this package: 2 discs chock-full of information and anecdotes you've always wanted or never (too bad, you're getting it) wanted to know...ah well, I guess that's not exactly true - I mean, if you're a far gone full-goosed Who fanatic, perhaps you'd like to hear about each and every single sordid detail of Pete's, Roger's, John's, and Moonie's exploits. Nevertheless, for the price of admission, this little package is powerfully packed...somewhat you might say, like a certain quartet from Shepherds Bush."
2,"Bag It, a wake up call on plastics","Jeb Barrier is a likeable, interested guy who presents a serious subject in an enjoyable way. This is a well done examination of our plastic bag use, some attempts to curtail it and reasons why we must."
2,BRAVO! CHER!,"This is one DVD you'll want to watch over and over again.As a child I grew up listening to Sonny & CHER.The songs from the 60's brought back memories,including the Sonny & Cher clips from the tv show.Cher is a true DIVA, and represents what a real DIVA is. This lady can put a show on from beginning to end!"
2,We don't have Cher in Brazil,"In fact, I want to buy this DVD because it isn't avaliable in Brazil, but my equipment is able just for discs from 4th region. If you have a disc with this configuration send me a e-mail. Thanks claudia"
2,That's just how it is,"I had a lot of fun seeing myself in many cartoons, I was laughing and crying at the same time."
1,"Cheap, unreliable.","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
1,Buy it from a department store,The La Mer Concentrate is great... but it doesn't cost anywhere near this much. Even Neimans sells it for less.
1,Misleading,This particular case does not allow you to open the phone to the internal keyboard as hinted in the description. You have to take the phone out of the case to do that. The company was really nice in replying to my inquiry though. Good thing it was cheap. I bought other things from them that worked out really well.
2,Can't wait for his next book...,"I'm a little late getting to read this wonderful book, published in 2001, but am oh so glad I found it on the shelves.What a delightful read, couldn't put it down. When you laugh out loud and also shed a few tears you know you found the perfect book.Good Job, Jim KoKoris...keep 'em coming.Penny BurkeMt Laurel, NJ"
2,Wrong color sent,"The item itself is very good; however, I ordered 3 different colors, one of which you did not send (yellow rainbow). Instead, you sent 2 Medieval Blues and one Blue Hawaii. I was disappointed not to receive the color I had specified, especially since the girl that took the order stated that all 3 colors were in stock."
2,Not too seriously,"This is a great book for lover's of vocabulary. As you can infer from the title, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and pokes fun at itself. It is a virtual treasure trove of wonderful nuanced words with clearly defined meanings, explained in a non-traditional, fun, and interesting way. Recommended."
2,A great book about a great pitcher!,"I have almost no earthly idea why this book is out of print. It is one of the best books I've ever read. When I was in fifth grade, out teacher was giving away very old books from her bookshelves and I was just lucky enough to get one. This book tells Bob Gibson's grips and how he threw his pitches. And his accounts of major events in his career. If you can get ahold of one, lucky you!"
2,Dying to have known DVD (Gerson Therapy),"The Gerson Therapy represents the courage and unselfishness of one man, Dr. Max Gerson, to help the world with their fight against all disease. The fact that this information has been suppressed, plagurized and kept from the general public by our medical community and its associations is absolutely criminal and if our government wasn't so corrupt, it would be corrected as it should've been when Dr. Gerson presented it to our Senate many, many years ago.Japan is using it and so is Europe to cure cancer and many other diseases and yet most of the people in America are still having chemotherapy presented to them as though it's the only way to cure cancer."
1,Great service but . . .,the tape was in poor condition that had streaks through some of the tape. That information should have been stated in the description.
2,Excellent analysis of Knowledge Management,"Ms. Dixon does an excellent job of describing knowledge management and its role in making an organization more successful. Through the various models she builds, she makes it clear when to use which model and more important, for a technical person like myself, when to use technology and when not to use it. In these days when everything has a technological solution, it is refreshing to see a perspective that positions technology as the tool that it is. Excellent!"
1,What an unpleasant surprise ...,"Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book ....If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice. The fact that the man in the book is a scumbucket is even more reason to delvelop this as a reality...Well yes theres the word .. reality .. which is what this book does not have.""Experiences of a young girl growing to maturity"" is what the covers says ... what it should say is that this is so boring and meant for readers that think watching grass grow is exciting!"
1,Why Isn't The 2009 Anniversary Edition Widescreen Format???,"The old Dvd from 2001/2003/2005 (whichever!) states its Widescreen Format(1:85.1) with a Running Time of 93 min and Rated-R.The 2009 reissue DVD says its full frame with a Running Time of 91 mins and Unrated. (???)I'm glad that this release date got pushed back until January 2010 so that maybe I'll just cancel the new reissue order that I placed, and order an older DVD print from a private collector instead!This makes absolutely NO SENSE to me!?Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this for me if I am 'mistaken'?"
2,good slasher,instead of the lack of creativity that most slashers have this film is good. the style is wonderful and the charecters are real. they really got good actors for this movie. has lots of twists and you can tell where i know what you did last summer got there idea. the film had some scary parts. i would recomend this.
2,It's the greatest book about AST I've ever read !,"There's everything about breed history, housing, training and making your AST healthy and happy. And I like pictures and humorous comments."
2,One of the best movies of all time,"If you haven't seen CASABLANCA, you're in for a real treat. Not only is it a love story but it's a thriller set in Vichy France Casablanca with intrigue and broken hearts. And, unlike many movies that started out with good intentions, this baby delivers in all areas, even story.Some real twists and a great surprise ending. A real gem. Hold on to this one and love it."
1,Did not know it did not download to your device.,Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased. I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.
1,Casablanca,My disc is bad; It would not get past the 8th scene. I probably need to buy a new one --from somewhere else.
2,Great movie!,This movie is a must-see for folks of all ages! I can't believe I had never seen it before. Wonderful love story.
2,"Great film, good DVD","First of all: Mister "" thebadgercarlton "", Widescreen wasn't invented yet in 1942!Fullscreen is the only original ratio for Casablanca.Casablanca is one of the greatest films ever and the DVD is good, but the film really needs restoration, especiallyin scene No 13."
2,A movie fan's dream..film noir and romance combined.,"What is striking about the movie first is its setting: The waystation between Nazi Europe and America. The characterization is excellent. Bogart and Bergman play opposite each other extremely well, and Claude Rains is absolutely fabulous. Rains is witty, well played, and his humor is well timed and dry as a bone. All around, there isn't one person who plays his/her character poorly. Even extras with one line contribute to the movie's overall greatness. See it. Overall, an excellent movie with a good story, and a GREAT ending."
1,How should I put this?,"I hate this movie. Its not even a movie, more of a waste of time. I've wasting too much time writing this review already. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC! It doesn't even qualify as bad or horrible! See CITIZEN KANE a million times (no really, a million) before you see this one. If I could just leave all the stars blank, then maybe I could begin to do it justice."
1,"If you love this film, don't buy this DVD.","The Greatest American Film is destroyed by a choice of a critic who is chosen to do the commentary in this DVD set. How can they let Roger Ebert, which is considered the most stupid American critic nowadays, be a part of this masterpiece?"
2,Casablanca,A marvelous movie with all the foreign intrigue you could want.A true love story wrecked by war.The movie worked very well and I feel great about this purchase.
2,I Bought this as a gift,"I got this for my Father, he liked it & mentioned if the movie lasted 5 more minutes he would have had gotten cancer from all the smoking!LOL! Now that would cause a R Rating!!!!"
1,fornication,"same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell."
2,Love this movie,"I had always wanted to see this movie and when I found it for the price I did I could not pass it up. It is truly one of the great character pieces I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you don't like romance movies this one is still worth a watch."
2,A Package of Nostalgia,"What a wonderful gift! A numbered souvenir box containing ""Casablanca"" on 3 DVD's, 2 of which are on Blu-Ray (viewer take note) with footage of the Warner Brothers' history as trendsetters of the early history of movie making. Comes complete with a poster and a coaster to impress your friends when you host a ""Casablanca"" party - be sure to wear Ingrid's hat!"
2,Fantastic old movie!,I rented Casablanca as I hadn't seen it in years. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight. It was great!
2,Hookah,The hookah is great. The delivery was fast and the company was very helpful. They called and explained the various tobaccos and helped me pick some out.
2,I Love Steve Coogan...,and this was another jewel. Many of Coogan's characters aren't that familiar to U.S. audiences so this was a trove of unexpected fun. Hope I can see him live and in person someday.
2,beyound the sea of ice,"a very interesting book that follows a simular theam to Auel but is much more exciting and with less romance, which i am happy for, i never liked romance stories"
2,Best Illustration book I could ever wish for..,"""Creative Illustration"" is an amazing book. It is extremely useful, advice given in the book is exceptional. Most things discussed and showcased in this book I have never seen in any other art books (contemporary or vintage). Unique. Unbelievably good.This book made me a better artist, and I feel like now I understand everything with so much more depth.Loomis also gives a little insight in master Pyle's methods, compositions and advice for success in the industry that is still valid today.Best investment of a hundred dollars I've ever made. A definite must have for a professional, a gem for the serious student of illustration.(Note: This book is not for beginners. It's for people who are serious about the business. If you're just starting out, just get one of those ""how to draw (insert whatever) books"" and come and get this book in a couple of years.)"
2,Grill skillet,This is a great item to stir fry of vegetables or shrimp over the grill. I love the detachable handle which makes it easy to take the skillet off and on when using on the grill. The pan cleans up easily.
1,did not work,product did not work. wanted it to download music but it would never sync with computer it wouldn't charge the device either
2,"Pretty, dainty, worth your penny, but...","The set was agreeable in appearance I felt they were exactly what I had been looking for. They came precisly as advertised I was happy for some weeks. But, just like the fire opal set I bought at the same time as these, something in my skin did not approve and I suffered itchy ears and red, scab like skin, underneath the place holder on the back. I can assume the place holders were of the same make as the stud itself, but something about the opal set and this set made my ears painful. I'll just save them and have them cleaned to give them as a gift to some one with less sensitive ears than mine."
1,Too much revenge.,"Not much of a story. There is sympathy for the main character but too much repetition of the hurdles involved. At times the ""revenge"" theme just isn't enough of a story, and there is no more to the plot."
1,Not worth buying,"If you are a thinking person, this book is not for you. I could not finish the book, it just could not draw me in. It is comparable to a daytime soap opera, and I am not a fan of soap operas."
2,Excellent Album,"This is an excellent album, not only because Dee Dee is a fantastic singer, but also because she was able to provide some of the first vocal versions of many of the tunes. Nica's Dream is amazing with vocal precision most singers fall short of delivering. Lonely Woman is haunting and melodic. Overall, this is a fantastic album."
1,Not a bit of freshness to Horace Silver's masterwork!,"Musical projects based on singing lyrics to jazz standards are not to my taste. Just because they usually do not add a least bit of motivation and artistry to the original instrumentals. Horace Silver is a particular victim of that situation. In other words, I do not know any vocalized effort on his extraordinary work worth listening to except Mark Murphy's ""That's how I love the blues"" ... All Blue Note albums by Horace Silver - the great composer, pianist and combo leader - ... I'd rather have them all. Make your choice."
1,Offset dialog screens,"Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Great wave board,"My grandchildren asked me to order this for them to give as a surprise to their mother who, after they each recieved a wave board for Christmas, taught them how to ride them. She enjoyed riding and occassionally would monopolize their wave boards, so they decided she needed her own. SHE LOVES IT.The board is exactly as described and functions as expected and needed."
2,very fun,"I bought this for my 10 year old for his birthday - it was too big for him, so I then bought the smaller wave ripple (wave ripple) for him, and he convinced me to keep this one for myself. We've both had a great time learning to ride it. It took about a day to learn. I'd also recommend real protective gear - and not riding downhill. At all. Ever. (from experience)"
1,"fun, while it lasted....","Yes, this is a new kind of sports toy for the kids to ride. Great for using your body and balance. Was ok for the first 2 weeks, then we noticed that the back wheel especially, was flaking away and chunks were falling off of it. Made for a very bumpy ride. Tried to replace the wheels by ordering new ones, but do to command for them they are back ordered? Not really sure, when we are to receive them. So it worked for the first 2 weeks and now it sits. Didn't think it was too expensive at the time of purchase, but for something that can't be used, I wouldn't have paid what we did for it and have it fall apart so soon."
1,Cheap Plastic that Cracks from normal use,I bought one of these several years ago. I was riding it within a few minutes. I am an adult (under 200 lbs) and don't do anything fancy with it. I noticed after riding on occasion over a few weeks that small hairline cracks started forming on both platforms where the torsion bar inters the plastic. This is not properly engineered and I would guess that someone doing tricks on this board could easily break the plastic.
2,GIVES PEACE OF MIND,"I am very happy with this product as it gives me assurance and peace of mind that all of my photos will last (at least) my lifetime on these discs (or so they promise). It has been difficult for me to locate any ""archival"" quality discs in local stores. Once I found out that other (cheaper/regular) discs may lose data over time, I freaked. I only found out about ""archival quality"" discs by accident on Amazon. After using them (and reading the description), I felt confident enough in these to actually ""delete"" several GIGS of yearly photo albums from my computer into my recycle bin AND then, permanently delete THAT from my computer! Now that's confidence! Anyone who knows me and my picture taking OBSESSION would be the first in line to buy these, if they needed them!"
2,Learning can be fun!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old when she started telling me she wanted to learn how to ""tie shoes like a big girl"". She was excited to start as soon as we received the book, and continues to practice. The poem inside is cute and the laces easy to work."
2,Where to purchase this book (and PDF) online...,"This book (under the name ""MMURTL V1.0"") can be found on Sensory Publishing's website:http://www.sensorypublishing.com/mmurtl.htmlYou can purchase a PDF of the book (and the source of the OS itself), or pay extra for a printed copy in addition to the PDF. (My original review was truncated before the URL for some reason.)"
2,"So well written, I felt as if I was Vyry.","Best book I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. I am so glad my dad named me after such an intelligent and strong black women.Vyry Marie Herrington"
2,Loki does it again,"I've recently downloaded the demo. It contains the first 2 maps of the windows version (which I also own). The gameplay is great! I'm using Linux X4 with a 3D Prophet GTS 2, using nvidia's Linux drivers."
2,Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge,This is the first time that I have used the Q-Copy Replacement Cartridge in my Canon PC (E-40). The price was reasonable and I am satisfied with the quality of copies that I have made so far. I recommend this brand for routine copying. I have no complaints and intend to purchase it again!!!
1,Suck(s),"Don't waste your money. This movie Sucks. Iggy and Alice, are about the only redeeming qualities here. The only way this will ever be a cult classic, is if you are in a cult and your leader forces you to watch it."
1,Directions are AWFUL,Ordered this based on the product name. The directions are horrendous and make no sense. It is cheaply made and I had to rig it up in order to have the basket sit on the side of the pan as they said.. I would NOT recommend this item!!
1,Pretty but lame,"This unit performs well while it lasts, but mine only lasted a few months when using with care. I do not jog. The unit stayed in my car the whole time. It just stopped working."
2,Really worth the price,"This cute discman manufactured by Koss have a 40 sec memory for the hard bus time. The overall sound quality is ok and there's a bass boost option that work very well. Beside the cool design, I have to admit that the headphones are not the finest one but remember that price of this Koss player is the Panasonic and Sony 40 sec. models price divided by two !"
1,KOSS is a terrible CD player,"KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul. BUT THEY DON'T! Trust me, or you will pay with a couple of 20's and your sanity. I am not the only one, my cousin purchased the same KOSS CD player and one month later he threw it off a 5 story apartment building balcony. It's a piece of crap."
2,Great CD Player!,"This CD player is great! IT looks cool, doesn't skip, has the best sound quality I've ever heard, and it's cheap!"
1,"1 pen, not 12.","The description says you get 12 pens, but you only get one. Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good."
2,One of my favorite movies,"I love action comedy flicks, especially if Bruce Willis is in it. And this one, this movie, is one of the best examples of such genre, another being the Die Hard, of course. The very end of the movie may feel like too smoochy but you can't win 'em all, right?"
2,An excellant book for all ages and nationalities,"I love reading it, it brings back my childhood, several passages even made we cry as I thought of my Nonna.However, we have a great time reading it with our granddaughrer (12) in the morning with bsicotti and coffee/milk."
2,Great IS and Bokeh,"With this lens, I can capture very nice pictures of my kids/nephew/niece. The IS work wells. Handling is good. Bokeh is what I expected.The only thing that I like to have is the Full-Time Manual Focus which it doesn't have."
1,A Solid Lens with drawbacks,"This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one, the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100%. Secondly, when shooting wide open, the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this. I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens, however, is not a complete loss. The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate. I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you don't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos. That said, if I had to relive this purchase, I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality."
2,The Canon EF 70-300 mm IS is a GREAT lens for the price!!,"Bought this lens a few months ago and have been very happy with all the photos since. I don't think you can take a bad picture with this lens. I've taken everything from drag racing pictures of dragsters going 320 MPH, to beautiful zoomed-in shots of flowers and butterflies with amazing results. Can't buy a better lens for the price. It focuses super fast and always takes clear shots. You'll love it !!"
2,great,"i feel like paparazzi, this is fantasticworked WONDERS while photographing my last wedding; it was like i was standing at the altar with themrecommend"
2,Awesome Lens Great Price!!,"I had the 70-200 L F/4 usm without the IS, I returned that lens. Without IS it was not worth keeping for me, to many blurry pictures(must be on a tripod) So I exchanged it for this 70-300 IS USM about the same price too. Love it!! Made it all worth while. It's pretty good at up close, not a macro lens. Great with 300mm, Clear and sharp at all ranges. nice walk around lens for me. Very Happy with this purchase."
2,Great lens,Thrilled to see the price drop and I'd been waiting for the telephoto lens for awhile. I weighed the pros and cons of getting this one for my Canon 40d vs an L series lens but decided in the end that this would do nicely in the meantime. I took some excellent shots through my kitchen window of some baby birds and was very pleased with the detail.
1,Over priced...,"This lens sells new at Best Buy for $500+, the price they show before the 51% cut is way out of focus... Has never sold for $900+, not even on the Canon Direct web site.."
2,Makes Guero look thin....,"...and I gave Guero 5 stars. Beck does it again. DVD is awesome as well. Of all the ""keepers of real"", Beck keeps it the realest."
1,a mulligan,"Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project, I scanned it and sent it to my mom.The music is typical Beck, the funky side. No ""Sea Change"" or ""Mutations"" here. It's perfect background noise, too, for like if you're scrubbing your floors or working on a paper or smoking up.I gave it 1 star because the DVD that accompanies the package is the single most self-indulgent tripe I have ever seen in my entire life. Beck is capable of so much better and THAT'S why I feel so put out. and taken advantage of. But it's ok, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes and in a career like Beck's, there haven't been many. I'll give him a mulligan."
1,Cumbersome and cheap,Forget this camera. After owning several digital camera's over the years and knowing how to operate them after only a couple of days it takes constant programming for every picture you take in order to get a good photo. This is not the camera for just grabbing and taking a photo. It requires thought and total concentration to just get an acceptable photo. I'd buy an off the shelf Kodak from Kmart before buying this one again.
1,The Camera that wasn't,I cannot review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me. Nor has my money been returned. I am very disgusted with the whole business. It's too bad. It looked like a good camera.
1,worst movie ever!!!!!!,"don't waste your money one of the worst movies I have ever seen no plot, vague story line, just terrible"
2,Too Large,I had to return this card because it wouldn't fit in the available computer space. So I really did not have a chance to use it. I have an HP 8760C. The card is about 10 inches long. So just make sure you measure the available space.
2,Better than the original,"It pains me to say that. But these instrumentals are much better than the versions with vocals. Sorry dude, but you're not a great singer. ""Clean Living"" was awesome. But that doesn't mean you have to sing on every track. Stick to what you do best: making beats. For other vocalists. Or, as is the case here and on most of his best older songs, instrumentals. If you didn't like 'The Third Hand' before, give this one a shot. I consider it the better album."
1,Good Product money wise but not Safe,"I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great."
2,"Very, Very Good CD.......","....I was very impressed with this CD. I had heard of this band, but never purchased their first CD. Though, now after listening to this one, I will get my hands on whatever this band has released. I would love to see them in concert. I can't wait till them come to Ohio!"
2,"Like the mat, love the length","This mat's color pretty much resembles the picture, a pastel green. Being 5'9"", I love the length of the mat and have no problems with any poses. The thickness vs the weight is right-on for my needs. I would prefer something just a *little* more thicker for my knees, but I wouldn't want anything heavier for classes.The mat does tend to slip a little bit in the beginning, but it wasn't too bad. You can just use a yoga towel if you tend to be a heavy sweater (I'm not at all, and I only had slippage problems with my hands in downward dog)Overall, I think this was a nice mat at a great price."
2,Very pleased,The process was very quick and easy. My book arrived quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition.
2,Victims No Longer,"This is an excellent book. I am a counselor and the issues addressed regarding male child sexual abuse are so important. So many males have been molested and/or incested and carry shame, so that they, perhaps more than females, do not report it. Yet, these unresolved issues carry into adult sexual and friendship relationships until they are healed. I bought a copy for myself to use clinically and one for a friend who is a survivor of incest."
1,Unsatisfied,"I am not satisfied with the item i purchased from you. The item frequently freezes and stops, making it difficult to play. It does this everytime i try to play. It's still malfunctioning and i would love if you help to resolve the issue. I really had my plans on enjoying a game of Sims 2, but this game will not function correctly. Ever since i received the package it has been malfunctioning incorrectly. I will not play and constantly stops and freezes up. I would LOVE a full refund if you cant resolve the issue. Thanks."
2,A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!,"Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value."
2,gone with the wind,"One of my all time favorite books, one I have read several times. A true classic. It brings the South to life."
1,"A wannabe ""War & Peace.""","Written during the Great Depression when Americans needed escapism, GWTW and the resulting movie it spawned are primarily responsible for distorting many Americans impressions of slavery, as well as trivializing the horror of the Civil War. If you like your history covered with moonlight and magnolias and sugar-coated beyond all reality GWTW is just what you are looking for. After all, its only fiction. Problem is, too many people over the years have come to regard it as almost gospel. In the end, GWTW is little more than a cheap attempt to create an American version of Tolstoy's ""War & Peace."""
2,The Best Book Ever,"My paper back is barely going to withstand another reading since I have nearly worn it out. I actually read the book before seeing the movie. I was very disappointed! The movie made Scarlett seem so evil, but in the book she depicted more as a strong woman who did what she had to do to survive. The only thing that would be better than reading this book again, would be to have the audio version so I could listen to it in the car."
2,Used but Good Book,"The copy is a 1940's print, and is definitely used.I would have liked a bit more info in its cover condition, (It had parts of the original in a plastic protective sleeve) and the book was very musty.However, the pictures inside were beautiful and the book itself was in good condition.It made a wonderful present for my GWTW obsessed friend.Now to see if I can find myself a copy..."
1,It didn't work and spoilt my coffee maker as well,"Well, I am pretty disappointed with this prodcut as it spoilt my new Krups coffee maker as well. Its supposed to take loads of upto 1600 Watts but my 1200 Watt coffee maker was apparently too much for it to handle."
2,great gift for soon-to-be moms,I bought this and a few other Bella B items for my sister-in-law who is expecting; she loves all of the products.
1,.,This book was just not for me. I don't see the sun let alone the beach...that should have been my first clue.
1,Not for every taste.,"I'm not into this eccentric approach of this major work. After having a long tradition of superb recordings of thissymphony by Karajan (1963), Fricsay, Furtwängler, Abendroth and Bernstein (DG), this Celi bizarre reading could be a bitof shocking to anyone. If you are fond of a weird phrasing and tempi, deliberate rubato and bizarre unbalance, this couldbe your perfect choice."
1,Ended up not liking Bobby Fischer,I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.
2,A Good Sample,"This is a good sample of swinging tunes Mulligan recorded with other top notch saxophonists. A nice blend of standards and Mulligan originals. The highlights are the Zoot Sims-Mulligan and Paul Desmond-Mulligan teams. Favorite tunes are 'Chelsea Bridge, 18 Carrots For A Rabbit, and Line For Lyons."" Fine out of production sampler of some of Mulligan's brightest moments. If you can find yourself a copy, highly recommended."
2,THE 1.33:1 ASPECT RATIO WAS HOW IT WAS INTENDED,"Some customers here, according to their reviews, suggest not buying the DVD because it is not in the widescreen format. According to Donald Richie's ""The Films of Akira Kurosawa,"" the definitive analysis of his filmography (film by film), Kurosawa did not work with the widescreen format until 1958 with ""Hidden Fortress"". So ""Samurai"" is shown in its original format on Criterion's DVD. Hope that clears up the confusion."
2,Great collection for a film buff !,"Any time a Criterion Collection edition of a DVD comes out, it is usually worth the few extra bucks it will cost you.This presentation of ""Seven Samurai"" is fantastic. Great features on the 3rd disc, and the book is great reading.If you want to call yourself a REAL movie buff, this has to be on your shelf !"
2,One of the greats...,"A cinematic giant, now on DVD.Probably the best movie to ever come from the east, and the basis for some of the great American westerns."
1,The template,"Like many of Akira Kurosawas films this is a template for basic storytelling that has been referenced, borrowed or used over and over again. Truely a masterpiece."
2,A great story,"There are many accolades and volumes of in depth analysis for this film, so my review will be short.The good: Strong, weak, sad, wise, frail, crazy, calm, etc; the full gamut of characters that really work together to twist complex situations. The story keeps you guessing first time. It is timeless and the subitles did not bother me...because the pace of the movie is easy enough to keep up with reading but also watching.The bad: It can move too slow at times and I had to break up the film and view over two nights.Conclusion: This is a movie I will watch again, probably a few times if lucky."
2,One of the top ten best films -EVER.,"Not only one of the best Samurai films, but one of the most perfectly made films ever! The story is well made, the realistic characters are played by powerful actors (one of them being Toshiro Mifune), with lots of drama, humor, philosohpy AND all in 207 minutes! What more could you ask for? Oh, don't forget the ACTION!The DVD, of course, also has extras, like audio commentary and the original US theatrical trailer."
2,Unforgettable,"This is absolutely the best movie to be filmed. Ever. I have seen a ton of movies but this was the best. Even though it has a simple storyline, it's a very complicated film. The characters are very well developed, Kurosawa is a born genius. It runs over 3 hours, but it is so interesting that you WILL keep watching it! It has action, humor, suspense and much more.The story is set in the 1600's in a small village. The village is constantly being robbed of their crops by bandits and the townsfolk want to hire unemployed samurai to defend themselves, only giving them food instead of money. Enjoy the film, you will love it."
2,And you thought kids watch teen movies!,"I first saw this movie on the action channel. I remembered it and bought it on a DVD. Me, being a fan of these samurai movies, loved it. Great acting, phenominal battle scenes, and cool sword slashing samurai. If you like samurai movies, 16th century Japan, played and liked Onimusha: Warlords and Shogun: Total War, buy this. Oh yeah...I once saw this samurai film on the Bravo Channel. It was about the Takeda Clan and the Uesugi Clan. At the end there was this battle, I think it was the battle of 4th Kawanakajima. At the end it showed the Takeda Shingen and Kenshin Uesugi fighting in a pond. Then after Shingen was injured, Kenshin went away with his calvary in an arrow formation going against the wave of Yari spearmen going back to camp. If you know what the name of this movie is...post a review on this page that tells the name....Thanks."
2,The best movie ever made,"This is the best film of Akira Kurosawa and the best film ever made. Citizen Kane is as good as this movie, but cannot make you feel the same emotion. The history of the cinema never was the same after Seven Samurais."
2,Check the original aspect ratio nefore you complain...,"I'm sick of all the people that complain ""Why isn't it in letterbox/widescreen?!! I can't believe they butchered it and put it in fullscreen!"" etc. It was shot in 1.33:1 ratio, and its displayed here in its original ratio, so before you complain about it and give them grief, know what you're talking about. All it takes is a little google search or god forbid a look at the box where it says ""original aspect ratio...""...and I never thought that sitting through 3+ hours of a 50s Japanese film would fly by faster than most of the 1.5 hour movies I see today. I was never board for a second. But I can see how it may not be some people's thing. Since Criterion are expensive, just give it a rent first."
1,didnt like it.,"didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful, did not find any of the characters even remotely interesting. in fact if you asked me i could not tell you who the main character was. Kurosawa was praised for his camera work, in showing all the major characters, but that's exactly the problem. yes the characters were major but WHO was the main? also, for a film that sets the standard for action films, ive watched almost all of it (prolly 1 hour lefT) and havent seen one fighting sequence. or anything."
1,One of the most boring movies ever!,"I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't ""get"" them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. ""Tampopo,"" ""Crouching Tiger,"" ""In the Realm of the Senses"" and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them. Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female. I think this is one of those ""Emperor's New Movies"" that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!"
2,A Monument to the Writing Life,"No cartoon series is followed more closely by writers than Peanuts and no dog understands writers better than Snoopy. Writers love the Snoopy cartoons but most writers will be amazed that there are so many of them. Now you can have a complete collection.Barnaby Conrad is the director of the Santa Barbara Writer's Conference. Charles Schulz drew huge crowds each time he spoke there.As an author, I will treasure this very special book.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com"
1,"CAREFUL: Cheap, yes. But these are low quality media","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
1,"As a teacher, I found the ""sports coach"" tone distracting.","There are already dozens of creative writing ""how to"" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending."
1,Disappointed,"First of all, the rating I gave this DVD is based on the poor quality of the tape transfer not the movie itself. I happen to enjoy this movie.I would rate it 4 stars. When you have Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, President Reagan, and an outstanding performance by Raymond Massey, how can you go wrong? Yes, it's not a historically accurate by and large. But who cares? And really how many Hollywood produced movies are? Just kick back and enjoy this piece of pure escapism. A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.) from our American history. However, the tape transfer is horrible. It's grainy and dark in some scenes. It's hard to watch. And there are no extras to it. I would recommend to avoid buying this Synergy Archive Series copy. Let's hope Warner Bros. decides one day to restore this film and market it."
2,High on the list of movies that p**s off liberals,"While this movie seems to flaunt its disregard for historical accuracy, it's still a fun adventure romp with several well known figures from American history. Errol Flynn as JEB Stuart is a blast as he battles straight-arrow rival Ronald Reagan (George Custer) in love and war. Raymond Massey is chilling as homicidal maniac John Brown and Olivia De Havilland is a peach. The whole film is refreshing for its unapologetic rejection of the post-bellum political orthodoxy imposed on the whole country which beatified John Brown and sanctified the Glorious Cause that slaughtered some 600,000 Americans. I'm sure it must have raised some eyebrows even in 1940, never mind today. In all, it's a fun movie which gains a lot of extra points for its delightful political incorrectness."
2,Great for Travelers,"I recently came back from a trip to Australia. Not only was this book invaluable for everyday communication, but the section on Australian slang saved me from being totally lost when talking to Aussies. A must for any traveler to a country where British English is spoken. The comprehensive list of word comparisons make this a serious reference book, but the expressions and idioms are what make this book fun to read! Explanations on acronyms such as ZIP code and Amtrak, as well as unraveling the mystery as to why Americans drive on the right and Brits on the left make this a great book for resolving disputes. My only criticism is that I would have liked to have seen a few more of the humorous illustrations which help to lighten up the book."
1,A Semi-Interesting Mess,"The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading. Some terms were terribly out of date, others wildly obscure, and at worst, just plain useless and random. I love both the UK and language, and I found this book a badly done bore. Also, shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting. I finished about 60% of it before giving up, and I normally eat this stuff up."
2,"Love it or Hate it, It's Still Great Prose","I enjoyed this book and it was well written. It's a nice reflection of spirit of the time and it's well constructed. I've noticed that people either love or hate this book, but I'm wondering how much of the reaction of those who hate it is due to false expectations based on the movie Stone Reader. I think this book will appeal to those who enjoy literary writers similar to James Joyce and love reading well fashioned prose. However, if you're searching for a book that will change the way you think about the world or this piece of American history, you may be disappointed. The book is excellent for what it is: beautiful prose about a writer's experience growing up in a culturally empty place in a particular time."
1,Not Believable,"The book is unbelievable as in NOT believable. No way is it reality to beleive eight-year-old boys in Iowa, in early 1950s, would know, much less use such language."
1,You have to love this book,"When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say, finally giving up and putting it away.The characters weren't very well explained and the conversations they have are just plain boring. Mossman's descriptive style reminded this reader of the hippy-speak of the sixties. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make any now."
1,Adobe InDesign CS2@work,"This book would only suit a desktop publisher rather than a Prepress or Graphic Designer, I found it failing in the concept of Type and general overall usage."
2,This book is fantastic.,"I have long wanted to cook Indian at home, and this book has helped me do that (well!) I have made several recipes from this book, the most notable being the ""Heavenly Korma"" which far exceeded any Korma I have had in a restaurant. I am so glad to have come across this book, and I'm sure I'll refer to it for years to come."
2,The Last Trail,"This is the last of a trilogy published in 1909 after ""Betty Zane"" (1903) and ""Spirit of the Border"" (1906). It's a historical novel set in the Ohio River Valley in the late 18th century shortly after The American Revolution. It focuses on two bordermen assigned to protect the settlement at Fort Henry. Bordermen are self-appointed protectors of the region and both are very capable. They set out on the trail to determine who the renegades are that are stealing Fort Henry horses and kidnapping the women. Also, there appears to be a traitor at Fort Henry helping the renegades. The love interest of one of the bordermen causes him to question whether to continue his duties on the trail or devote his life completely to Helen. Zane Grey paints a beautiful picture of the region."
1,not a novel,Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan. Instead I found a detailed and tedious history of tea. I gave up after a couple of hours.
1,Ok,Didn't really interest me enough to read mire than first couple of pages. Probably wouldn't buy again. To others though this could be their book.
2,Real Samba,"Contrary to the review by ""Music Fan"" of North America, this IS real samba, authentic as the life of Brazilian black people and habitants of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Moreira and Sargento are two of the greatest masters of samba. They are not professional singers, but influential composers and artists. If you want to get experienced in this kind of art, don't hesitate to buy it. If you want an easier introduction, try the David Byrne compilation. It's the ""best"" through his eyes, or ears, but Brazilian music is much more than that."
2,Price Hard To Beat,"I have the 2 LP's bought in the last 1970's and have the 2seperate CD's from several years ago. You're definately going to find(dollar amount) worth of rock music and rock ballads here. Hard rockers Witch Wolf, Young Man, Winner Take All, Rock & Roll Feeling, Havin A Ball and Man of Miracles are the best of JY's songs. Reminds me why I wished he would've contributed more to Brave New World. Dennis is great on The Grove of Eglantine, teaming up with JY on 22 Years, A Song For Suzanne, Lies and Christopher Mr Christopher. Former guitarist John Curlewski screams out The Serpent Is Rising with ferocity. The band's patented backing vocals are in full force here. If you're a Styx fan and have gone as far back as Crystal Ball and Equinox, you might as well go all out and get this double set as well as Styx I and II. They're well worth it."
1,McLaughlin leaves us waiting,"I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful, this release is sour and dull. Though John does execute his technical prowess (ie. ""chops"") as always and the band plays beautifully, the tone of his guitar ensures a lackluster mood when listening. The album is somber. I don't think the pick-up, tone, distortion, or chorus settings on his guitar were changed throughout the entire album. blah-blah-boring-blah."
2,This Novel Is What Great Writing Is All About!!,"I recently finished reading this novel and fell in love with the characters, the story itself and the message of both good and evil, as well as the concept of ""Timshel"" or ""Thou Mayest"".John Steinbeck is without a doubt a superb storyteller. ""East of Eden"" has many facets and dimensions within it. Somehow or another Steinbeck is able to write a multi-dimensional story with phenomenal characters and keep the entire novel cohesive from start to finish.I had a difficult to wanting to do anything but read this novel once I started reading it. The writing is fantastic and entertaining... The characters are fabulous and there was always so much going on in this novel that you eagerly want to find out what is going to happen next!This is a must read novel. Steinbeck is such a wonderful writer that I can see why he won the Nobel Prize for Literature!"
2,One of the 5 Greatest Novels Ever Written,"Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is outstanding, but ""East of Eden"" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: ""Timshel"" (""thou mayest""). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around ""Timshel.""This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love ""East of Eden."""
2,"A ""boring masterpiece""","There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again."
2,Steinbeck goodness,This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone.
1,Plastic!,It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
2,I work here. Trust me. It's the best thing ever written.,"I am a writer for the new National Lampoon that is launching in late September. There are only 3 of us here now, but believe me, sometimes it is hard writing under the shadow of the genius that created the yearbook parody. It is THE National Lampoon issue to own. You'll never laugh harder."
2,Please Reprint!,"Will the world listen to the plea of thousands and reprint this masterpiece of 60's parody!!! I cannot face the future without seeing Ms. Armbruster one more time! Also, I need to see the Dacron, Ohio newspaper parody too! Please, dear lord, to see the joy in my teenage children's eyes as they read these wonders for the first time would hearten my soul forever!!!"
2,Go PATS!,Bought this for wife as a stocking stuffer. I'm sure she'll enjoy backing her team without taking up the whole window.
2,Classic,"John Carpenter's Halloween tells the story of an escaped mental patient Michael Myers(Nick Castle)Michael was locked up for 15 years after he killed his sister.Dr.Loomis(Donald Pleasence) is on a frantic search for michael, Loomis knows Michael will return home to kill.Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) a shy teenager is being stalked unknowingly by Michael.As the night goes on Michael kills her friends till it comes down to Laurie and Michael.The Screenplay was done by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.Great script one of the best of the genre.And John Carpenter directing was top notch. He creates the perfect mood and will make you feel trapped just like the characters.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee were awesome in their roles.And the score by John Carpenter was very chillingThe Halloween DVD is loaded with must see extras"
1,"Nowadays, this is pure B-comedy!","The first one in the series of (so far?) seven Halloween movies probably was a superbly scary thriller-horror movie in 1978 - but for today's public, it rather appears as a comedy.There is barely any blood in it, and Michael Myers is easy to knock down (even though he doesn't die, of course...) by a young Jamie Lee Curtis who, by the way, look like herself, she only had longer hair and a smaller behind back then.The real surprise in fact comes in the beginning of the movie where we see who Michael Myers really is!"
2,The best! I had to watch the last of it with the lights on!!,"This is my favorite movie of all time. It all begins when Lori (CURTIS) is babysitting 2 kids when psycho serial killer Michael Myers murders her friends and comes after her. I loved the ending and the rest of it. About half way through the movie, I got so terrorfied that I had to turn on the lights! This movie is so horrorfying, that it still grips you with fear long after the movie is over!"
1,They Cropped out the Boobs,"The movie speaks for itself. However, they cropped out Linda's boobs when she's laying in bed. That's one of my favorite parts!!!!(no pun intended) You see them 20 seconds later when she gets strangled on the phone so WTF!"
2,Absolutely Scary!,This would have to be one of the alltime scary movies.The roleof Michael Meyers steals the film. Meyers escapes from an insane asylum and returns home. His doctor played by Donald Pleasancegoes hunting for the evil Michael Myers. The villain of this movie starts killing the members of two groups of teenagers whoare celebrating Halloween.He is scary. After several killings by Meyers the movie comes to a conclusion. The doctor finally locates Meyers and shoots him several times blowing him off the balcony. The movie has a creepy ending with the supposedly killedMichael Myers nowhere to be found.The music at the end of the movie is absolutely creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of thebabysitter does an exceptional role. This is a must see movie. Buy it.
2,Best Slasher Film Ever!!,"When a little six year old boy named Micheal Myers stabs his sister in cold blood to death, then you got one Hell of a problem. John Carpenters Halloween set the standards for every slasher movie to date, John Carpenter is a genuis, Next to Remero and his Dead films. Im not to crazy about the sequels to this film, but Halloween will always be a great movie. Micheal Myers Stabs His sister to death and is sent away to a Maximum Security Hospital for life, But escapes in a stolen station wagon, driven by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Who's Mission is to find Myers and put him away for good before lives are risked. Anyway, Micheal goes after his sister Lorrie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) Who changed her Last name because of her Psycho Brother, and some of her friends who get in the way, and its up to Dr. Loomis to stop him. John Carpenter even made up the creepy music score on a piano himself. This film is as good as it can get, it gets two thumbs up."
2,Best horror movie ive ever seen,If youre looking for a halloween movie to rent or buy then i definitely would go with halloween1. This is a great movie with plenty of violence and gore. It is interesting and exciting to watch. This movie should be every horror movie fan's favorite.
2,An absolute masterpiece of Terror!!!,"This DVD, released last year, is an absolutely terrific representation of John Carpenter's vision of terror in a suburban setting. The picture is nice and crisp, thanks to THX, the sound and video system developed by Lucasfilm, a great restoration of this true classic of horror. In the film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is terrorized by the man who later is found out to be her brother, Michael Myers, an unstoppable juggernaut of a masked killer. Myers is pursued by his Doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance in a very memorable role), who seems to encounter hints of Myers' evil as he chases him down to attempt to apprehend or kill him. 30 years later, this film still does not disappoint to frighten everyone. But hey, as Sheriff Leigh Brackett points out, ""Everyone's entitled to one good scare."" Plus there is a terrific behind the scenes featurette, along with cast bio and behind-the-scenes photos. Get this one if you can. 5 stars!!!"
1,"Oh, please!!","I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The 13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!"
1,This sucks...,"This is the worst movie of all time. I rented it once, and let me tell you, I almost tossed my PSP at the wall. It was just way to scary. It was scary+100. My sister almost peed her pants when she saw it. If you have any mind at all, don't buy(that is, of course, you're still wearing diapers)."
2,Nice but not what i expected,i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
2,The Classic Horror Movie,"The story deals with a character named Michael Myers, who at the age of six stabbed his sister to death with a kitchen knife. After spending about a decade in a mental hospital he escapes and goes on a murderous rampage in his hometown Haddonfield. Halloween is loaded with thrills and chills that would keep about every horror buff entertained. Scripted and Directed by John Carpenter."
2,The Begining of the best Horror Series Ever!,"Halloween is an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleansance did the best acting. This movie is very mysterious, because you don't know why Micheal is going after Laurie. This isn't my favorite, though. Here's my best to worst: H4, H5(it was great), H1, H6(the t-cut! haven't seen p-cut) H2, H20, H8( wasn't bad.),H3 (it sucked)."
2,A Must Have For Every Horror Buff,Halloween is a original and scary horror movie that deals with a disturbed male named Michael Myers that goes on a infamous mass murdering rampage in his hometown Haddonfield.
1,Poor DVD transfer,The transfer to DVD is very poor (worse I have seen yet). There are so many artifacts in the video as well as black portions of the letter box that is can be quite distracting. The movie is a great movie but save the dough and by it on VHS or see in when it is on cable.
1,"""Kane Hodder should have played Michael...""","Well, I liked the music in it, it was really good, but, sadly, it lacks a lot of Michael Myers. What I mean is, it doesn't show his face/mask a lot. Plus, Michael Myers is just plain looking, Jason and Freddy are more dead and scarier than this. But, the score was great, and the whole concept was good. Another thing, the body count was too low! Jason usually takes out 10 to 20 people in every one of his movies. And plus, Michael Myers should have been played by Kane Hodder, than he would have been a lot creepier than whoever plays Myers now. Jamie Lee Curtis was an extremely bad actor, and her voice was just too manly! So, I'd really only recommend this because you need to watch it to understand the whole concept and because it has an excellent score, but if you understand the whole thing already (I mean, before seeing any of the movies) than do not watch this."
1,Utterly Ridiculous,"Anyone who thinks this is a ""definitive"" version or a ""director's cut"" is sadly misinformed. For the record, Carpenter filmed these 'extra' scenes for tv as the censors had cut so much material from the theatrical release that it wouldn't fill the necessary time-slot. That's why the 'new' scenes are not widescreen. Furthermore, and more importantly, Carpenter has said that he HATES these scenes. Just his to his own words on the Criterion LaserDisc commentary. That this version is marketed and hyped is pathetic."
2,Halloween Blu-Ray,"I am grading this solely on the blu-ray quality since everyone and their dog has seen this movie and probably come to the conclusion that this is a horror classic if not the best horror movie of all time.The quality of of this blu-ray is great. They did a great job cleaning this up for blu-ray material. This blu-ray paired with my LG7600 Clearmotion technology made this movie look like it was filmed yesterday. This movie was not filmed in the best of conditions and the equipment and film was not very good, but you would never know it when you watch this on blu-ray. I was really impressed.Now I am 30 so I wasn't alive when this movie came out, but I do appreciate the greatness of the movie. If I had to pick my top two horror flicks I would pick Exorcist and Halloween (in no certain order). They just don't make movies like they use to. My generation just can't figure it out. I highly recommend this for any HD enthusiast, and especially Halloween fans."
1,Where's the ending?,"There is no real ending in this book. After the reading the last chapter the book leaves you asking yourself, then what? The characters are interesting and Nancy is surely a woman to stay away from and not unlike some women I have known in my lifetime. Your led to believe in the book that the climatic scene will have something to do with the theft of a large amount of money that they have been talking about for half of the book, but it ends with indecision about the heist and it leaves the reader clueless about several points."
2,Grandmothers life,I liked the book because it gave me an idea what my grandmother's life might have been like. She came west in 1903 with her parents to homestead in Washington.
2,Look at life from one womens perspective.,Great look back to life at a slower pace when our country was younger. One womens recanting her life after a move to Wyoming to settle our land.
2,Letter from a Woman Homesteader,"This was not my favorite book. I thought it was to simplistic. I received the book in a timely fashion and would consider buying from this seller again, however I did not care for the book."
1,lois,I read it for a book club. It was a Kindle free book. It was over priced. It was a waste of time.
2,Water wings,"They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made."
2,"Great price, great taste","This ingredient is used in cooking in Australia and probably other parts of Asia, but not easily found in the U.S. Or at least not where I live. It adds a great taste to the sweets that I have made and it's probably used in Asian cooking as well. I read that you can make it yourself out of unsweetened coconut, but this was just easier."
2,Very interesting,"The book that I read was So. B. It by Sarah Weeks. This book is realistic fiction because it could really happen to someone.So. B. It is about a girl named Heidi. Her mom has something wrong with her, and can not speak. Her next door neighbor, Bernie, lives with her. When Heidi was looking through her kitchen drawers, she found an old disposable camera. When she got the film developed there was a picture of her mom and grandma that she did not know about. But in the background she saw a sign and it said Hilltop Home. After that she found out more than she knew. I enjoyed this book because it was very adventurous. If people enjoy sad and adventurous stories than this is the book for you. I also liked this book because it said that you can do `' anything you want without anyone stopping you.'' I think this book is best suited for sixth graders and 12 and 13 year olds."
2,Excellent,"I saw this movie back in the 80's when we first got our cable television. I've always wanted to see it again and am also a big Albert Finney fan. It was exactly as I wanted it, bringing up nostalga. It is not a four star (1 1/2) movie for many more than myself. I was excited to have found it and now own it. Thanks."
2,Forgotten movie,"I have been looking for this movie for years. I remember it from when I was just a kid. It was nice to have finally gotten my hands on it and been able to see it again. The movie was ahead of its time. The basic idea is a company starts using digital representations of real life models and no longer needs the real person anymore. This movie came out in the 1980's, so imagine that! The movie has more suspense too as the models are being killed."
2,A Good Story,My only regret with this book is that I think I read it out of order. I believe that Trinity was the first of a two part story. But even by itself it stands as a really compelling story. I wasn't prepared for the places it would take me. It was surprising but nice to be transported to New Zealand. And the story of a very bloody battle (Gallipoli) which I had no previous idea of. I first thought that Leon Uris would only be an author of middle east books (having read Exodous and The Haj). But it was a pleasant surprise to find he is a master story teller.
1,Redemption,"As other readers have noted, this book is not nearly the book Trinity is. Wish I hadn't read it, the first was so good.I guess that's the trouble with sequels."
2,This is a gripping epic that leaves one filled with emotion,"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and it lead me to read ""Trinity"" the book before it. Mr. Uris truly endows the characters with realistic personalities and puts them in situations so gripping that one can feel as though they are actually there. I enjoyed this book immensely and I hope you will give it a try. -Chris Muller"
2,Superb collection of short stories about southern life.,"After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness, birth, death, and sibling rivalry. The author lives in rural Georgia and was obviously very observant and sensitive during her formative years. Her description of her family is painted with love and emotion and in such detail that the reader feels that they know every intimate detail of her family life. This book IS the life of a southern lady. All southeners and those who want to share the southern experience must read this book."
2,Nice Fit,I bought this clutch hose for my old 95 Ford Probe. It fits perfectly and working great. This part is rare to find and I have tried different local auto part dealers but no luck. I then tried Amazon and found it. Great price!
1,A Student Perspective,"As a student, I have found this book to be a very difficult read. The chapters were filled with impossible to understand details. Perhaps for a practitioner the book is useful, but as an introductory textbook in a university course, it proved to be a very thick volume with litte useful information."
2,Good Read,"This is a good view of the triumpial entry and Christs lasts days on earth from the perspective of the high priests right hand man/jewish slave. He is asked to be apart of Christs arrest and is the man whose ear is cut off and healed. He of course is transformed into a follower and we see his journey and what's required of him from then on.We did his in book club, and most of the ladies loved this book."
2,Doesn't get any better!,"I had never read historical fiction until this, and what I read was absolutely unforgettable! Through the eyes of Malchus, a servant of Caiaphas, and a skeptic, he finds out for himself who Jesus truly is. This book will make you think. What are you willing to stand up for? At what cost? Awesome! Beautiful picture of what Christianity is and should be all about!"
2,They are amazing,"I can honestly say that I have never had the experience of the other reviewer, and I have used over a dozen of these candles.I love them as I currently have 3 dogs, 2 cats and 3 rabbits in the house; you can imagine how much that would smell if I didn't do anything to help. My vet office is who recommended that I try them. These candles not just cover the odor, the get rid of it and then leave a refreshing smell- I have even moved one to a bathroom during a stinky guest's visit with great results. I have usually used the orange or strawberry, but plan on buying the vanilla today."
1,Don't bother,"Interestingly enough, this product was offered on the HP site when I ordered my new DV9000 laptop. As previous reviews have stated, it is indeed made of low grade plastic. I find it puzzling that HP would recommend this item, considering the fans line up in no way whatsoever with the laptop's cooling fans. The USB cord is too long and comes with an ON/OFF slide switch (which failed quickly). I cut the switch and wired it directly; it worked OK for a while. Now the USB plug on the chill pad itself has to be in just the right position to power the fans. A waste of money; don't bother."
1,Short Lifespan,This cooling fan worked for about 6 months before the USB power cable frayed and it developed cracks in the plastic. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be messing with the cord much.
1,"Poorly crafted, no noticeable affects.","My laptop has no difference in temperature than sitting on hardwood. So it's job of cooling my laptop left a lot to be desired, but hey, it angled it nicely for typing. About a month after I bought it though, one of the rubber pads that elevates your computer slid off, it was merely glued. I can't imagine what I could have done to prevent this, as it never left my desk... so I'm going to attribute this to poor craftsmanship.All in all I love Targus products but this felt like trash, you get what you pay for definitely is true here."
1,it broke,I started using this product in the beginning of July and less than two months later it broke. I treated it very carefully and held it properly and followed all the directions. While I was using it it did the job but not for long.
1,Complete piece of garbage,"Purchased this item, power cord started bugging out within a month. Had to forcefully tape the cord into the back of the unit after it crapped out to even get it to perform marginally.Huge waste of money."
2,Works like a charm...,"This Chill Pad works great. Keeps my P4 notebook nice and cool. My notebook fan, which used to run constantly, is now silent. Fans on cooler so quiet, I often forget to turn it off when I close up my notebook. Excellent item, especially for the price. Would definitely recommend."
2,Targus Chill Pad,"Other than the powercord on my previous chill pad coming undone due to wear and tear, I've had no other issues with the item."
1,Stopped working after only 2 months of having it,I bought this product on August 6 2007 and today Oct 16 2007 it stopped working. I have a Compaq Presario laptop and when I first purchased this item it worked great and then this morning I turned on the laptop and the Chill Pad did not turn on the fans all of sudden stopped working.
1,Don't buy Targus products!!!,"I have owned 2 Targus chill mats and they were the worst pieces of crap I ever bought. They last about 2 months before they stop working. Either they will just completely stop working or the fan blades will start tearing off, and then stop working. After about a week they start making a loud sound like something is caught in the fan blades. Unfortunately, they were the only brand available in my local stores, so I had to settle. I will never trust Targus for any product ever again!!! Sure, they offer a warranty, but to be honest, I'm not going to keep my receipt and warranty information in order to get them to replace the junk they sold to me with another piece of junk that will stop working in the same amount of time and charge me over half of what I paid for the product for shipping."
1,Wobbly,"Bought one of these a few years ago and really like it. Needed a second one, but when it arrived I discovered a manufacturing error - the rear bottom pads were the same ones as on the front; they are supposed to be thicker than the front ones, so as to slightly elevate the rear so it doesn't wobble on the center screw. You can even see it in the photos on amazon.com So with the same pads front and rear, the pad is worthless as it doesn't sit level, it sits on the center screw and wobbles!Tried getting the correct pads directly from Targus, they said to return it to the vendor. Amazon was nice enough to quickly send a replacement -- with the same problem.Two tries is enough for me, off to Best Buy instead..."
1,bad connection soon after purchase,"The design for this is terrible. The end of the USB cord going to the pad sticks out at least an inch, so it's really easy to bump it if you use your laptop on your lap. A few bumps and the connection inside the pad becomes faulty. If you try to keep using the pad, you have to move the cord around to find ""sweet spots"" so that the pad gets its power. This is very annoying, and there doesn't seem to be any simple way to fix it."
1,Didn't know it was so noisy.,"It does a good job cooling down the laptop but I use it sparingly because it's so noisy. I don't know what its dB rating is but it's certainly not like a typical PC fan. It's like five times louder than a typical PC fan. If there's a different chill pad that's quieter, I'd get one."
2,Cool Air From the Chill Pad,I've got two dual core laptops at home that I remotely run virtual images on and they tend to get rather hot with the lids closed. Putting a Chill Pad under each laptop keeps both of them much cooler. I don't hear the internal fan in the laptops firing up anywhere near as much. I did have to turn the Chill Pad sideways for one of the laptops to align the fan vents with the laptop heat vents but it works fine in that configuration. If I pick the laptop up and put it back on the Chill Pad the fan inside may start to spin off balance. You have to turn it off and then spin it back up. Overall a great deal for heat venting needs.
1,Horrible!,I orderd this chill pad in May. Didn't actually open and use it until the end of August. it has abruptly stopped working as of last night! Piece of garbage..........
2,useful product,"Pros:-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk, no more marks on wood-provides for good ventilationCons:-requires attention to placing laptop correctly so it's not wobbly (only an issue if, like me, you are taking your laptop off the stand every day)"
1,worked for a week,it worked ok for about a week maybe two then became unreliable. I have yet to find a chill pad that works well. I would not recommend spending your money on this one unless you consider your money extremely disposable
1,bad connection,"I own two of these laptop coolers. Bought at the same time and used with two different laptops. Both have the same problem. After about one month of use, the socket on the cooling pad works loose, so the device no longer receives power and the fans stop working. The fans do an excellent job of cooling both laptop and lap until the hardware fails.If I could figure out how to crack the case, I might try to repair these devices. Instead, I'm shopping for another brand with better construction."
1,OKay but not long lasting and loud,"I purchased this from Staples a few months back. It worked okay, but one of the fans constantly stopped working or made a horrible sound. It just stoppd working tonight."
1,Power Cord issues after a few months,"This fan was easy to setup and use. It did a great job cooling off my Thinkpad T60p. But, after only a few months of fairly normal usage (no drops/excessive wear/etc) the power cord connection went bad - I even tried taping it into place to hold it in better, but it didn't work for long.Also, the plastic fins on the fan can get bent - not sure how, but they do. And then they catch, making that fan not work (there are 2). I've gone in and fixed it - mostly by removing the bent fin."
1,WORST COOLING PRODUCTS EVER!!,"I bought this item originally from Wal-Mart. This is my FOURTH one in a little over a year. Every one I have had has died within 4 months. So I just kept either exchanging it for a new one, or buy a new one and return the broken one. Then it looked like Targus redesigned the PA248U because even though the model number was the same, they changed the casing completely and added an on/off button. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I got it. It was improved. Now it doesn't die outright. The fans will just stall out until you move the mat around and angle it up until the fans will restart. And to get warranty service, you have to pay to ship it back to them. But it costs over half as much to do that as it does to buy a brand new unit."
1,actual product model delivered is not of the pictured shown on amazon,I received a targus chill pad that was different from the one being shown by the seller. seller needs to update the image. chill mate cools the laptop but it is noisy. the fan noise can become annoying over time. I would not recommend this model.
1,The USB cable is a piece of crap,"The pad cools better than nothing, but the chord that connects to your laptop is terrible. I've gone through at least 4 of them over the last year. Consistently the part of the cable that connects from the cool pad to the on/off switch has a break in it. All I do is wrap up the cable, put it in my bag, and otherwise use the device on my lap. I'm not sure how to limit its exposure much more. Only good thing is Targus will replace the cable for you, but it takes a few weeks to receive.Also, the rubber nubs that hold the laptop in place are often lost with no replacements readily available. I'm looking for a better product at this time..."
1,Cheap quality,"Mine did help keep my Dell Inspiron 8500 from getting too hot, but the USB cable leaves a lot to be desired. About a month after getting mine, the fans stopped working. I found the problem to be in the silly on/off switch they stuck in the middle of the cable. I removed the switch and spliced the cable. However, now, approximately six months after I bought the unit, it appears that a wire has broken near the USB plug, and as far as I know, replacement USB plugs aren't available. I guess now it's buy a 5V AC adaptor and wire into the thing. Needless to say, I'm not impressed."
1,better than nothing@,"This device is an addition to the fan inside the notebook. However, by itself[;'vfv]\ it did little to cool the laptop down."
1,POS - and that does not mean point of sale!!,"This product if ordered should just go straight to trash can. Fans are in the center, which does absolutely nothing for my computer. Second, the fans are small, so no air is circulated by these things. Worst fan I have ever purchased....Finally purchased a large single fan that works and works well. Stay Away from this Piece of $***. You figure it out."
1,Decent while it lasts,"The pad ran quietly, but 2 years later it is missing 5 of the foot pads and the fans no longer run. For something with hardly anything to it, that's sad."
1,Great for first 3 months....then quit working.,"This was a great cooler out of the box, it is silent and cooled nicely. However, it's cheaply made. The power cords are very cheap, and the cooler itself is flemsy plastic. The pictures make it look much more substantial than it actually is. Our quit working after about 3 months. Targus makes a ""new & improved"" version. We tried it as well. Much better made, but it was noisey (so noisey it gave me a headache). So we opted for another brand and much happier."
1,Plastic and cheap,"I received a different chill pad than the one pictured. It is a very undurable plastic, and one of the fans is already making noise after 3 weeks. It does not cool well on a flat surface such as a desk, so the only useful purpose is if you have it on your lap. You get what you pay for I suppose, but I would not suggest it if you have te extra $20."
1,Didnt get the one in the main picture!!!!,Like the previous reviewer I too did not get the one that is in the main picture. I should have got one that has curves/contours on the sides but this one i got is perfectly rectangle. Plus get this the packaging that came with the one they sent doesnt even look like the one they sent. The packaging and instructions looks like the one in the main picture here. Plus the one I should have got has vents on the side. The one i got does not. So beware when u order this. U wont get the item that is in the main picture. Seems like a much inferior replacement they sent instead. Not happy!
1,Not what it seems,"This product is not as show or described. It looks like a replacement for the Targus Chill Pad that goes into a lap-stand. The model shown is a great Chill Pad that has high speed fans and fits into the Targus stands. However this model is super thin is low speed fans. There is also no room to vent the heat out the sides or top or allow cool air to be blown by the fans. The fans also began to freeze up after a week of use. I ordered two and regret it. Don't let the fake picture fool you, this is a low model of Chill Pad and is poorly designed. There are much better models out there, such as the actual one pictured."
2,good book,"Good information in the book, but the more I read online the more I question if flipping is right for me"
1,Disappointing device,"I've been using the BT250 for a couple of weeks now. Here's what I've found:1. The belt clip stinks. The device drops off it all the time. It's silly to see a $90 device sabotaged by a 15 cent piece of plastic. (It looks stupid, also.)2. The standby time is nowhere near the 240 hours Jabra advertises. I find that it gives me a low power indication after about 24 hours.3. The 250 is awkward to put on your ear, which is a real pain when you're trying to take a call.4. I've found no way to voice dial on my Blackberry 7290 with the 250.5. The distance you can be from your phone is more like 10 feet, as opposed to the 30 that Jabra advertises.6. The volume is very loud on the Jabra. I have to turn down the phone or reduce the volume using the buttons on the 250 all the time.I'd recommend the Motorola HS810 which has a good carrying case, voice dials on the 7290 with no problems, goes on more easily, and has more intelligently designed buttons."
1,FreeSpeak 250 - Not That Great,"I was really looking forward to the Bluetooth Wireless experience; however, the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250 is not all that great. With regular usage for three months with my Sony Ericsson T637, I found: a very short battery life, mediocre reception, and a shorter roaming range from my phone {suppose to be able to move 30 feet away from your phone, I couldn't get it to work beyond 7 feet}. Additionally, people would often tell me that they heard excessive static in the background and that it was hard to hear me.This technology could be great, but its a little overrated right now with the cell phone accessories that are currently available. I have had good luck with previous Jabra products and this one, the FreeSpeak, is just disappointing. Maybe I will try this again in a few years. For now, it's back to the ""wired"" headset."
2,best purchase,I purchased this camera just before a trip to New Zealand. I had two requirements wide angle and macro. This camera more than delivers. It was very easy to learn. The battery life was good I used a battery a day. I purchased a back up battery. I took over 2000 pictures. Thus the back up charged battery. The camera took awesome photos the zoom was a major bonus that I was not really after. Overall I highly recommend this camera and Amazon has the best price going. There are some bad pictures posted on here that I feel do not represent this camera. A camera is as good as the person pushing the button. I have never taken a class and I find this camera user friendly. You judge I have posted pics.
2,Very good camera.,"I have used this camera for two vacations and many back yard pictures and am quite impressed with it's capabilities! It was a little hard to get used to because it has more complicated settings than our previous Kodak digital camera, but I do love the 10-power zoom and high quality images! The 10-power zoom is especially helpful in capturing wildlife shots that will amaze your friends!"
1,Panasonic Lumix,"While the LCD image is clear and sharp in good light, it is distored in low light and at distances. What good is an ultrazoom lens if you can't see what you are shooting?"
1,Lacks quality great concept!,"Im a photographer. I compared this head to head with My Canon S70. The S70 quality of pictures far exceeded this camera. After working with other photographers and Panasonic I have determined It can NOT take a very high quality picture even in perfect situations. It only takes pix with 72 DPI vs 180 DPI with my Canon. The highest MB image it will take is 3.51. My canon will take averate 2.5 to 3.5 and will do 4.5-5.5 often. WHY is this important. Well if you blow this picture up to say 5x7 or larter you will notice SIGNIFICANT grain and distortion. It was sad. I took pix in all lights and even focused on ASA 100 and used a tripod. Im sending it back, Its not worth keeping for anyone who wants to blow up or appreciate a good picture. Panasonic even stated its a beginners camera. So my 5 year old technology in my Canon 7m camera Blows this Brand new camera out of the water."
1,After 1 month pump does not work.,"The pump does not work after 1 month of intermitent use. The gasket in the bottom was installed wrong and water got up into the motor. The motor is now locked up. Pump area is fine, but shaft will not turn without a socket and ratchet. Usually get 2 years out of a pump."
2,This is a wonderful book,"When I opened the package I was surprised that this book was so big. I was expecting something a lot smaller. Then when I started reading I was surprised that it held my attention as long as it did. Some of the items take up a page or two, and some only take up a paragraph or two. They say my mind jumps around a lot and that is what this book does, it jumps around a lot and for me it is interesting reading and it holds my attention when few books are able to do that. At the price these books are selling for used right now you can't go wrong on this one."
2,"Very, very impressed","I listend to this Paganini rapsody many years ago and was totally overwhelmed. After that I bought ,seperatly, and listend the rest of them. I must say that their interpretation are excellent and very deep, especially the neat structure construted here are very, very impressed. Many other versions perform Rachmanninof with too much feeling, but here it is just enough. Highly recommended."
2,Golly.,"Showy and theatrical makes women swoon and men's chests swell lush breathless passionate no-holds-barred romance more powerful than any film soundtrack. Above the keyboard, bangs flopping sweat spraying and whiplash over the keys. Plato's Idea of Piano."
1,"Perfect in the beginning, Nightmare in the end.","I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.Opticbook scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials, because I didn't want to waste the lamp life.The result? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner. Service of the company is horrible. I sent several emails about my problem, but never got answers."
2,power washer,For the home owner it does what ever you need at 1750 psi. My last one was gas @ 2500psi. This electric washer is a no brainer. Easy operation and at 1750 psi can still do damage to wood if not carful.
1,Really inappropriate,"I don't like this film and because of it, it gave me a different perspective of the original as an immature movie.It's great for adults but anyone under 17 don't watch it i guarntee you thatI am 13 years old, so pretty please with a cherry on top, recommend my review PLEEEEEEEEEEASE or else!"
1,Sex and nudity in the city of gambling,This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
2,Elizabeth Berkley is a babe!,"Having been a fan of Elizabeth Berkley long before this movie was made,was thrilled to learn she got the lead. I really dig watching Liz in this movie, she is beautiful as always and does not let anyone push her around. Just watching her hitchhike at the end and beginning of the movie is enough to make any man smile, I just wish I could have been the driver picking her up! Great movie, here's to hoping Elizabeth will star in the much needed sequel Showgirls 2. Recently I saw her starring in the movie Student Seduction, Elizabeth Berkley is easily one of the most beautiful and talented actresses today, she is in the same league as beauties like Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, Ashley Judd, and Hilary Swank."
2,A big slice of cheesecake,"Elizabeth Berkley stars as a hooker who wants to be a Las Vegas showgirl...only to find out it's not as glamourous as she anticipated. All I can say is, they certainly saved money on the wardrobe....Elizabeth Berkley spends over 50% of the movie naked."
2,hey hey hey what is going on here?,"first of all laugh all you want but i actually thought that this movie wasn't all that bad.i do think that gina gershon played her part really well.i also think she could have played elizabeth berkley's role too.i thought the movie was way better than striptease.i've seen both the r-rated and nc-17 versions and i saw no difference.i also didn't see much reason to rate it nc-17 either.the funny thing was i was sitting there thinking to myself,you know mr.belding and screach got to work with liz all through her teen years and they probally saw this movie.hell they probally own it!!!!-jason zabka"
2,"Highly Underrated, The Plan 9 From Outer Space Of Our Time","Showgirls, by Paul Verhoeven, is definatly the sleaziest movie ever made. But is is also really underrated. Showgirls is basicly a American Dream movie, about a girl who goes to a town to make it big. Showgirls is filled of nudity, but not very much hardcore sex. If you wanna see a so bad it is good movie, see this one."
1,TRASHY,Over hyped! Not even good photography. Would not recommend it. Don't waste your money. Try to find some other film.
1,This is by Thrustmaster!?,Totally disappointing. The dead space is unbelievably large and the 8-directional button keeps misinterpreting input strokes. Can't believe this junk has the Thrustmaster name on it. The wheel is cheap plastic construction and has a very flimsy feeling. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
1,"Arcade OK, but simply not up to standards for simulations!","Here we go!! just got myself a XBox, F1 2002, and this steering wheel...My conclusion is simple and dreadfull... it's just doesn't give me accurate control over my car!! The deadspot in the center is just to big, and the forcefeedback get's a 2 out of 10. The experience with my PC and wheel is better!! and thats not the reason for me to run to the shop...But ok, as an objective reviewer i can give it 2 stars as it is useable in arcade like games."
2,Good But with a few flaws,This wheel is really good. The only major flaws are that when you change racing games you may need to change the sensitivity of the wheel. I was really looking foward to having a realistic gear shifter but it only shifts up and down which makes it good for the games like cell damage but not so realistic for games like project gotham racing. The foot pedals are great and i recomend you get this game wheel.
2,A Tragic story,"As one of the characters in the book, I am grateful to Andrew Schneider and David McCumber for portraying what has happened to Libby, Montana and its residents so thoughtfully and thoroughly.The book is a ""must read"" for everyone.The story is far from over in Libby and around the country, but if what has occured in Libby serves as a lesson to other communities, it will be worth it.People can make a difference, if they don't give up and are surrounded by people that believe in them."
2,A True Account of Lethal Deception for Profit,"The author Andrew Schneider tells the story of uncovering a scandal of major proportions. It is a frightening, chilling story of hidden dangers allowed by government officials whose jobs are to keep us safe. It is the story of a mineral still used in our country whose lethal dangers were recorded by Pliny the Elder. Asbestos cannot be safely used in any manner."
2,Pioneer Families of eastern and southeatern Kentucky,My wife thought this book was a great book of info to help with her research. Wll look to purchase more books on the subject.
2,Unparalled story craftmanship,"I have just finished this book. It was a delight. Uncle Remus is one of the most alive characters ever to be portrayed in literature. Now, this is coming from someone who has read Conrad, Doctorow, Carrol, D.H. Lawrence, Robertson Davies, and many other engaging storytellers. Somehow, Uncle Remus resonated with me across the 120+ years since it was written. The simple concept of a free slave mentoring a plantation owner's boy by masterful storytelling is pure magic and often heart-warming. For anyone young at heart, this book is a must."
1,Low Quality Filter,The white filter has an inferior quality to the one that came originally with the machine. It broke totally when I tried to wash it first time. That did not happen to the original one even when I washed again and again. I wonder if the replacement is fake.
1,Beware-- shipping ruins these planters.,"I bought these planters because I had owned them before and they were very durable and attractive. I especially liked the high-gloss look. Unfortunately, when I received my planters, they had been put in the shipping box with the wadded up, rough craft paper that Amazon so often uses and it ruined the high-gloss finish of the outer planter. The other planters were nested inside and were fine. So when I ordered them in another size, I ordered one extra figuring that they would be packaged the same way despite the fact that I notified Amazon of the problem. Sure enough, same problem, but I was able to return the ruined outer one that I didn't want anyway-- it essentially served as packing."
1,Okay,"""Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2"" was an okay film, but not a great one. The original was better. When I ordered this, I thought 'Alright, I finally get to see Tromie, the Nuclear Squirrel.' I thought he'd show up at the end, but the makers of this film had to ruin it by showing the end of the film at the beginning. That's why I didn't much care for this one. Also, I didn't like the theme song. All they said was ""Class of Nuke 'em High Part 2"" over and over again. But I'm glad I only had to pay 5.99 for this movie and not 13.99."
1,Easily the worst movie ever!,"Blasting in my right eardrum, right now, is the Class of Nuke'em High, Part 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown theme song. Yes it has a theme song, and it does have the title in the lyrics. The hero of this film, apparently, is a hot hunk of man-flesh named Roger, who is smitten with a sub-humanoid, but is unable to get sex because he has B.O. The antagonists are mouths in peoples stomachs. Roger is really hot, and so are most of the bodies, but the mechanical mouths are too sickening to make this film even worthwhile as a bad nudie-flick. The plot makes sense, I mean, why not?"
2,Daughter's now part of the airsoft games,"My daughter wanted to join the buys playing ""bad guys"" and this was a good fit. We haven't used any caps but the gun is good quality for the price"
2,Neanderthal Man,"I gave one to my 14 yr. old grandson who has AD/HD. He loves to take things apart and usually keeps me on edge when he comes for a visit. However, this toy kept him and a friend busy and interested for a couple of hours digging out the bones. They had a great time and did well in finding all the bones and putting them together. It was somewhat messy, but easy to clean up afterward."
1,Item is Not as Described!,I ordered two of these pans. One for myself and one for my sister. We DID NOT RECEIVE A STAINLESS PAN! We received an aluminum pan with a non-stick black coating on the interior. The pans we received were from the MC2 collection. Amazon sent me a new pan but I received another MC2 pan. So now I have to return two pans and my sister must return one. We are both collecting the 3-ply All-Clad stainless cookware. I am very dissapointed. Amazon will not honor a comparable sale price on a stainless pan.
1,One of my least favorite Nora books......,"Cassidy St. John is out of work and is thrilled by artist Colin Sullivan's offer to pay her for modeling for a portrait. He treats her terribly throughout the whole book and then wants to marry her in the end, because he is haunted by her face. I doubt anyone would fall for such an abusive, domineering man in real life.Excerpt from the back of the book:""Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John hardly expected the solution to her difficulties to come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. However, the darkly handsome Colin Sullivan seemed the answer to any maiden's prayers.When Colin offered Cassidy a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seemed her troubles were over- but one look at his blue eyes and Cassidy knew they were just beginning. How could she hide from the pitiless honesty of Colin's artistic vision when with every stroke of his brush he exposed her love for him?"""
1,Old and Tired,"This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book."
1,Dorf,"I did not review ""Dorf Goes Fishing"" however I did See the Complete Dorf Set. I did not find it funny. Even as much as I enjoy the comedy of Tim Conway. Probably would not recommend this title."
1,Not Socrates Cafe.,The Socrates Cafe is a poorly written book. Christopher Phillips was to busy using fancy words to realize that the reader has to spend 15 seconds on words just to pronounce them correctly. I like his ideas but he came up short putting them into words! Using fancy language is not always a good thing. The best writing is writing that is clear and precise.
1,Do Not Buy,"I wasted money on four packs, every burn has failed. I used about ten before my burner went dead and stoped reading dvds all together, so I had to buy a new burner and they still don't work. You get what you pay for."
1,Waste of money,"This makes for a good late night HBO movie when you are bored. Not worth the money spent to own , nor the time spent watching it. IF it was 20 years ago I might have said it was a good movie , but nowadays its just too boring and obvious."
1,A ridiculous waste of paper!,"I was grievously disappointed with A MAIDEN'S GRAVE, especially after reading THE BONE COLLECTOR. Certain weak premises are unforgiveable - such as frequent the use of the word ""stoat"" by numerous characters, including the deaf ones and their interpreters, when a sign-language interpretation of that word would be automatically translated to ""weasel"". This is Kansas, not England! All the characters are poorly-defined and broadly unsympathetic, except the smallest children who are barely more than props shaken at the reader like helpless puppies. The ""suspense"" in this book left me feeling dirty and voyeuristic."
2,Even an avid suspense fan won't foresee the surprise ending!,"When a busload of deaf girls are kidnapped and forced into an old building by murderous convicts within the first pages of this novel, I felt as if this book was doomed to go downhill. The police have surrounded the building, there is little or no chance for escape,and how can the police hope to coordinate a succesful rescue when they cannot communicate with the hostages?Jeffrey Deaver manages to take what seems like a dead end, and turn it into an entertaining roller coaster ride. We watch as the hostage negotiator dances verbally with the head of the convicts to keep him from killing the hostages and as the eldest hostage uses subtle sign language to calm the others.But just as the seige seems to comes to an end, we learn that surrender isn't always a permanent thing."
1,What is on the tape?,It is hard to know if you want to buy an item when the descriptioin does not include what movies are on the tape?Could someone post that info?I'll rate it higher when I know what it is?Phillip
1,Disappointed,I was really disappointed with the product. It is to thin and the chain turns a dark color after a few wears. I have only had this item for 3 weeks and have had to clean it four (4) times already. Would not recommend it for purchase.
1,Kind of junky,"Not really worth $250... ""leaves"" are just cut from flat sheet-metal, not all the candles are exactly vertical, and the chandelier i received was missing a hook for one of the crystals."
1,Bailamos all the way.,"Only the song ""Bailamos"" can stand the test of time. If you are non-latino (like me), you can safely switch off the CD after the first song. I am thankful to the manufacturers that the best song is the first one. I don't even have to forward the CD beyond the first one to listen to the rest of the songs. It might be attributed to my little knowledge of lingua-latino, but I am not sure. I bought this CD when the latino fever was at a feverish pitch. Ricky Martin, I forgive. Enrique, your album is all greek and latin to me."
2,MARIETH DAVILA.,"ENRIQUE TE FELICITO LA CANCION ES MUY BUENA,TIENE BUEN RITMO Y TU VOZ EN INGLES SE OYE MUY BIEN,ME FACINA TODA TU MUSICA, ERES EL MEJOR."
2,Bailamos: Me gusta mucho,Great music! Does anyone have any idea how I can obtain the lyrics to all the songs on Bailamos?
2,Great,"I love this song but I would really like to get ahold of the words, can someone send me the words to the songs?"
1,The names of this book's reviewers seem fake ...,"""Warren Buffet"", ""Mr. Benson"", etc. Give me a break. This author has people going to individual blogs, especially those that are centrist or conservative in origin, and spamming their comments sections with pseudo-testimonials. Seems like a rather pathetic way to sell a Chicken Little, doom-and gloom, progressive, arab-apologist tome by a State Department flunky. As I can see, many would appear to be gobbling up the tripe!"
2,A MUST READ FOR EVERY VOTER THIS FALL,"CRIMES OF THE RIGHT is a suspenseful near-real thriller set in the world of domestic surveillance, international espionage, Washington , and California Politics. This well-researched thriller demonstrates the events of the past four years in a fictional set-up, to entertain, dazzle, engage, engross, and make you think. If you're tired of reading non-fictions, try this near-real-thriller fiction."
1,"sadly, a shoddy work","Arthur Ashe made many fine contributions to America, but this isn't one of them. Not up to the standard set by the other books in the series."
2,"NICE,AWSOME,COOL SHOTS.","THE HONG KONG PART WAS AN AWSOME,SUPER DUPER,COOL GODZILLA PART.GODZILA'S STOMACH WAS COOL.HE LOOKED AWSOME AND BETTER THAN EVER.THE BATTLE SCENES ARE AWSOME.THE DESTROYERS PART WITH THE POLICE BATTLE WAS AWSOME.EVEN SUPER X 3.THE PLACE THEY FIGHT AT IS COOL(THE AIRPORT).EVEN LITTLE GODZILLA,HE GREW BIGGER AND WAS COOL LIKE THE FATHER(GODZILLA).GODZILLA DOES DIE IN THE MOVIE BY A MELTDOWN DESEASE.THE END WAS COOL WHEN JUNIOR GETS BIG AND ROARS LIKE GODZILLA.THIS IS MY FAVORITE GODZILLA FILM.I THINK THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN GODZILLA 98."
2,"Terrific, Magical, spellbounding,left me speachless",Tells more than enough about the old dragon ways and is the most dramatic and heart warming novel yet. The Great Aurora will rise again. (HOPEFULLY)
1,Many Miles Away..a tribute to The Police,Some things are better left untouched. And this is the case with this cd.Being a professional touring musician this reeks with stink. I can't believe someone would release this to the public. Not a single track on this cd is worth anything.Next time leave it alone...The Police are the masters and you people are still in kindergarten.
2,Tells you what it really means to let go!,"This book tells you what it really means to let go and what happens if you truly let go. Many times we think we have let go of something in our heads but we are just in denial. Our heart has not really let go. This book has helped me overcome some of the most painful experiences in my life. If you want to really understand what letting go means, I'd also recommend ""The Ever-transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato. After you read this book by Toru, you will feel very free and understand how life is actually quite simple and extremely beautiful."
1,Ok,Not what I expected it to be. More religious than I prefer and definately works with the AA platform which wasn't what I wanted.
2,Life doesn't always go as we want. This might help.,"Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless, at some certain point, reality has to be accepted, and you need to move on. You can only suffer for so long.This book is both a crutch and a companion. It can be a guide. It is certainly worth the read."
1,The worst proofed book in the universe,"This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it."
1,BORING,every teenage girl should watch this before her first datebefore going to makeout lane don't forget yor diaphramgirlfriend
2,Good educational supplement,"My 3rd grade special needs child enjoys reading these stories and the reinforcement of the ""dot pen"" with its lights and noise is a lot of fun for him when he has to work on the reading comprehension questions. The downside is that the stories range from 1st to high 5th level (guide marks each story). I would prefer to have a box of stories with less range (maybe just 1-2nd then another box of just 3-4) but we're using these and will continue."
1,Cheaper Than It Looks - Cheaper Than It Costs,"The product looks nicer online than it does in person. When I opened the box, the stand was intact, but 10 of the 12 magnets had popped off the back of the cannisters and I had to reglue them myself.There are 12 spices included with labels, but it would have been nice if they provided more pre-printed labels for other spices, or at least blank labels you could fill in yourself. Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
1,magnetic spice rack,"The idea was a good one but,....... the tins fall off the metal base not enough mag in the magnet and they have been rolling all over my kitchen and it's big and bulky and no place to put it, a little too big for my counters. No where to hang either."
2,My son loves this hat!,"My son got it in his head that he had to have a ""Coolie"" Asian style hat to keep cool. He's 11 years old, so kind of odd for his age. I convinced him to buy this Chillba hat instead of the traditional straw woven hat. I was afraid the straw would fall apart too soon for the asking prices. I figured if his interest passed then at least I could wear it for gardening! It is cooler than hats that rest directly on your head and works very well keeping the sun out of eyes and has a wide brim for shade. I felt it was worth the money since it is washable and a nice sturdy cloth material."
2,Beautiful and Practical,"This is a beautiful, practical (or should I say, practical, beautiful) piece. It is called a ""Casserole for Two"" but that would be two that are very hungry. I use it mainly for soups. It goes from cooktop to tabletop perfectly. When I do use it in the oven for a casserole, the same is true. It is a beautiful serving dish. The pan cleans easily. I cook for two (sometimes three or four)and use the ""Casserole for Two"" frequently and love it. Jo"
2,I'll Be Watching You,I loved this book...it kept you guessing right up to the end. Very fast paced and exciting. I have really enjoyed all of Andrea Kane's books. You get involved with the story and almost feel like you're there. I hope she keeps writing a lot more.
2,Absolutely essential to your collection!,"I used to have this recording on vynal. I got rid of it when I converted to CD's only. Needless to say I did not hesitate to spend the $25.00 to have it again but on CD. VERY good listening. Some of my closest friends were skeptical, we're not big Boz Scaggs fans, however, once they heard it they quickly changed thier minds. This recording is not quite the same as a 1980/90's Boz recording. It's heavier on the blues side with nice horns and guitar. A real must have."
2,Very good value and performance!,This center channel speaker has a very crafted high quality appearance. I took the grill off and was impressed by the speakers themselves. I never realized how important a center channel speaker really is. I invested most of my money in the front and surround. I hooked this speaker up and it really filled the void you feel when there is not much activity from the other speakers when you hear dialog from movies. I thought they had good high and mid range. The voices and other center channel output sounded rich and strong. The 6 1/2 inch woofers are better than I thought they would be based on some other reviews I read.
1,?????This Game is confusing and stupid?????,This game is confusing and stupid!! It is hard to find out what each butten means but please use your money wisely and dont get this game!!!!! Get Roller Coaster Tycoon or The Sims.
2,Great Game,This game is a great game! You learn about the economy as well as build what some people think is great. It is true that the tutorial does not finish but this still is a great game. I highly recommend this game
2,"I would give it five, but...","I really like the availability of a calcium/magnesium supplement in powder form. And I am sure KAL does a fine job in quality testing. I give it four stars only because you must be very careful with the dosage. I used their recommendation for a few weeks and wound up missing several days of work with terrible diarhea. After taking several weeks away, I started again with half the dosage, and have had no problems.I recommend taking this conjunction with a good vitamin D3/K2 supplement."
1,Not worth my time,"Despite its colorful vocabulary, The Blood Countess has no merit in terms of content. The author simply describes the perverted, without having a pertinent message. If you enjoy reading about disgusting fantasies, then, by all means, read this book. But, if you are seeking a book that is more historically focused, look elsewhere."
2,Great for different types of beds,"I have a weird shaped bed that means I can't use most bed skirts so this was great. It wraps around my bed frame perfectly and looks very nice. The only problem is, that on my metal posts it keeps riding down/doesn't stay up. So you have to pull them up once you make the bed. But I am not sure if there is really anything that could be done about that with the type of bed I have so I am pretty happy with this product."
1,DUST RUFFLE,"Nice material. Well made but way way too short unless your looking for a 10 inch drop don't bother. Way way too short...also can't return because Brown's Linens enclosed a letter that said 10% re-stocking fee, no shipping cost to be refunded and if item was sent with free shipping, the amount they paid to ship to me will be deducted. Not worth spending more money to send it back to them with all the deductions I would end up owing them even more money...Oh well, maybe someone else could use it, I'll put it in my garage sale item pile."
2,The dark side of the river is revealed.,"Keepers was hard to put down. I read it in two days. It held my attention and I remained curious throughout the book as to where we were going. What did all these people have in common?The book was well written. The setting was perfect for the story. I have been to the bluffs, the mounds, the islands and caves of the river. The author did a nice job of taking me from nostalgia all the way to the occult. I loved the mystery and dark secrets of the river.Schulz has a bit of Stephen King lurking about. Are his ""keepers"" of the same breed as Kings ""low men""?If you have been to the river read the book."
1,Needs better editing- mistakes found,"The judges for our trivia contest used this book as the arbiter for disputed questions tonight, and the NYT Almanac was wrong or incomplete on two questions, verified by multiple sources. Number one, The place Lee surrendered to Grant was not a ""Courthouse"" in Appomatox, Va.... rather, It was a farm in the *town* of ""Appomatox Courthouse"", VA. A quick Google search will confirm this on dozens of sources.The question the Almanac was incomplete on, was about the Definition of ""DVD"". Properly and technically known as Digital Versatile Disk, the NYT Almanac only metion only a colloquial ""Digital Video Disk"", which is common, but not accurate. A DVD can contain video, but not all DVD's contain video.I wonder how many more mistakes there are in this book? Yeah, I'm a sore loser, but right is right and wrong is wrong. Maybe the Almanac makes up stuff too?"
1,Give me a break!,Kiss have more compliation albums than I have had hot dinners. This is just a rehash of other compliation albums. Nothing new here. Double Platinum is far better
1,Kiss it Off,"If you're a die hard Kiss fan, you probably already have all these songs, so don't bother with the CD. If you're not, don't bother with this CD. It's full of rather unimaginative, derivative 70's rock, absent the spectacle of their stage performances. If you like Kiss & don't have many of their CDs, then get this one ... it'll do until you can afford the others.Personally, I'd go for concert footage in surround sound, or even music videos. This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power. More interesting.But choose your own poison ... how you want to blow your hearing is none of my business. This CD just doesn't rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it!"
1,POOR SOUND,"I HAVE ALREADY SENT THE T.V. BACK TO TOSHIBA TO HAVE THE VOLUMN REPAIRED, THE T.V IS IN THE KITCHEN AND YOU CANNOT HEAR IT AT MAX. VOLUMN 5 FEET AWAY. AFTER BEING REPAIRED?????, ITS NO BETTER"
1,Not all that great...,"I finished this in one day. It is that easy a read. Its got a virtually non-existant plot. The characters are also rather flat and unrealistic. It does try to have some humour here and there, but that's about it. It's not worth the time spent reading it, unless you happen to be doing a book report on something sucky. After I read this, I doubt I'll go watch the movie, even though the movie has a great cast. Overall, a disappointment."
2,Gift of the Red Bird,Very inspirational. I was totally filled with the Holy Spirit. I think I would like to go on a retreat like that. We have so much to learn. Please try it.
2,Cristo Vive,"...Y viene por una iglesia sin mancha y sin arruga. Preparémonos mas y más, el que esté preparado, sirva aún más, y el que esté en el proceso, ¡Clame, clame, congemidos indecibles! ...para que Nuestro Señor Jesucristo fortalezca nuestros lomos y así continuar este camino de guerra yendo de victoria en victoria y de poder en poder, con Cristo: ¡Llegaremos...!"
2,"Right Place, Right Time","I came to this book from the perspective of someone getting its brand ready to take its first tentative steps overseas. Anholt has provided a vital resource for anyone wishing to do the same, especially in these times of overnight global dotcoms.Heartily recommended."
2,Another Great Novel by Peter David,"Great story, Peter David has really created a great new series for star trek fans, although there seems to be a long wait between the novels. The charactors are great and a nice change from the tv series as David can do what he wants with them as they are his creation. He takes them to the stars and back and almost always weaves a great plot. love Calhoun and Shelby!! 5 Stars David"
1,Disappointed,I just received these a few minutes ago and was very excited to try them. I tried to put them on 2 different pairs of my daughters shoes and they do not fit. My daughter is 5 and wears a size 12-13 shoe. The package says 4+ but I think it should say 4 and under. Also one of them is flawed from being stretched over the insert that was in it. I guess I will see about returning.
1,Ruby Slippers Shoe Covers,I was very unhappy with my purchase! I wanted to give the reviews the benefit of the doubt; I should have went with the majority! My two granddaughters and I had a Oz paarty and the shoe covers were off within the first 15 minutes! I agree with the shopper who said to save your money and invest in your little girl a nice pair of red shoes that she will get to wear for more than just a few minutes! Not worth the money! :(
1,Cute but Not durable,The shoe covers were different sizes and did not stay in place. The bows came off some shoes prior to the tots going on stage. As they began to dance the shoe cover came off. They are cute but good for dress up only.
1,Formulative,"That's actually more of a 2.5 than a 2, but compared to XTC's later work, or even their next album, it's really mediocre. ""Statue Of Liberty"" and ""Radios In Motion"" are excellent songs, as are ""Science Friction"" and ""She's So Square,"" both included as bonus tracks, but there isn't much else to grab hold on here. Most of it's just generic quirk-pop (especially Colin Moulding's songs) and there's an endless, almost melodiless cover of ""All Along The Watchtower"" included as well. I'm not gonna say ""But it's better than 90% of recordings today! "" like all other fans because it's not. But the band got better really, REALLY quickly after this one-- they just hadn't pulled themselves together yet."
2,human growth master mind group,"This collection of works by the various authors offers the listener an opportunity to have an easily accessed master mind group in the field of human growth. The morning commute's blahs are a thing of the past when the driver plugs in a tape or cd and visits with the likes of Jack Canfield, Marianne Williams and the others. Each offers a conversational monologue which address basic human perceptions and attitudes. Whether at home or on the road, each tape is a treasure of information which offers the listener tools to reshape basic views of life. These tapes are well worth the value. They are like good traveling companions. You welcome their presence, and delight in their gifts. I strongly recommend it to anyone."
2,I just love it.,"I just love this cd.I like every one of the songs but, ""party with me tonight"" is my favorite. If you like blues it's the one to buy."
2,sultry...blissful...awesome,"I've been a long time fan of Mazzy Star, but this album surpasses what Hope Sandoval did with Mazzy. Has the same feel but more sublime and matured. Her vocal skills seem to be sharpened a bit also. Not that she gets operatic or anything, but reveals slight nuances of purring and tonal hooks. It took me a couple listens to get this perspective, but my ears finally came around. For any fan of Hope Sandovals previous efforts, you will not be disappointed at all. I can't wait for her next release!"
1,Useless don't waste your money,"No material of substance. Don't waste your time or money. Look somewhere else. ""The Idea Hunter"" by Andy Boynton is a better book."
1,O'really..,"The contents' probably great, but what happened to the cover of the book? Did Young & Bernbach over-squeezed their ""creativities"" and left the cover of this book out cold? Wake up guys...bright yellow is a definite NO-NO for a book cover...leave the ""neons"" for Las Vegas...!!"
1,VERY MISLEADING!!!!,"I just ordered this item and no where does it state that the dvd is missing it specifically notes that it is a blu ray & dvd combo pack as well as on the front it has where it said ""blu ray +dvd"" the +dvd is taken out. It should just say Blu ray since i got this so my daughter is able to watch it in our car as well in the house...which now i cannot, the movie is great but the fact that the title is misleading and im not getting all thats in it is upsetting."
1,Some inappropriate moments for family viewing,"There are a few inappropriate scenes in the film, for instance a very busty gnome girl calling out the rules of a race in a racy manner and wearing a blouse with a lot of cleavage. Other scenes with a male gnome in a very tiny spandex outfit that is meant to be funny but seemed a bit obnoxious in reality. We were a bit uncomfortable at times watching this with the kids. I don't recommend it for kids under 13, and if you're much older than 13 I have difficulty in seeing how you can like this film. My wife and I both couldn't wait for it to be over!"
2,Adorable movie you'll be surprised how much you love!,"I was pleasantly surprised watching this movie with my kids and husband. It was adorable! And it was updated, kid friendly, and used in-jokes to keep it Shakespearean! Not to mention that Patrick Stewart played a statue of William Shakespeare talking to Gnomeo (James McAvoy), when both played Professor X, one as the young version, one as the old...Plus, it as just feel goody, happy, and used mostly Elton John music for the musical numbers instead of made up sugary tunes, which just made it more funny. It was great! (And my kids loved it too, LOL.)"
1,Horrible movie!,Did not follow the Romeo and Juliet story. Was a waste of my time! Don't waste your time with this movie!!!
2,Gnomep & Juliet was GREAT!!,The movies arrived promptly and was in great working condition!!! The movie was very funny and I cried at the end.
2,Volume 3,It's good to see the characters in a different setting. Rowan Atkisson plays a very different part in each of the four seasons. Great take on how to develop a series.
2,Brilliant Rowan Atkinson,"I positively LOVE British comedy... Benny Hill, Fawlty Towers, `Allo `Allo, Mr. Bean, Monty Python, Mind Your Language etc. The best of these is Black Adder.Black Adder turns history upside down on its head. Forget whatever you learnt of the Tudors because you will have to re-learn it when you watch the ""real history"" of Black Adder.For those who are unfamiliar with this series, it may take you a while to understand the nuances and ""read between the lines"". But this ability to understand the humor will increase as you watch the series. A general underlying truth is that each episode gets funnier as you move forward in this series.Rowan Atkinson is positively brilliant! Honestly speaking, I think that his performance in this series is just head and shoulders above his comedy in Mr. Bean."
2,where did it go,"i know this album had the bonus-cut ""its a man's pride"" or ""man's pride"" where can i find it? that song should be in his top five"
1,Driller Killer,"How horrible! I waited years to see this (it's only now allowed to be seen in Britain again) and was so dissapointed. Let's face it..Abel Ferrara movies are crap..he's probably the most over-rated independent director around and Bad Lieutenant his most over-rated movie. The only films of his worth seeing are Ms 45 and Dangerous Games (only because it's the only film ever that Madonna acts well in). Budget restrictions aside, this is still grimy, cheap exploitation (nothing wrong with that) that tries to pass itself off as 'art'. Watch it once but don't add to your collection."
1,Moto-X,"Lets see I really dont like the game at all, it gets boring quick its just not one of THQs good games.The gameplay is ok but thats about it."
2,Great reference,"I have a 30 year old version of this book that my mother used in college. If you want to know how to integrate any weird function, look in here. The best table of integrals i've ever seen, and lots of helpful formulas and references. A terrific reference. I have used this book for virtually all my classes as an Electrical Engineering major."
1,Huge pills impossible to swallow,"I have never had trouble swallowing pills. I can even swallow 4 normal sized pills at a time. But I can't even swallow one of these pills they are so huge. They don't even fit in a pill cutter! It is incredibly painful when one gets stuck in my throat. My swallowing muscle contracts around it and it is awful. I even tried cutting one in half, but it is so fat that it still gets stuck. I tried coating one in butter, and that didn't work either. They are going in the trash."
1,I didn't receive the product ....,I bought the product but I didn't receive the product. The vendor service was bad.
1,William J. Hennessey's Modern Furnishings for the Home,"Not a bad book and it might be just what you're looking for. 300 pages, all b&w, picture quality is only fair. I guess this book belongs in a quality library but I found it generally disappointing at the price."
2,Jimmie Johnson Cooler,This cooler goes everywhere with me. It has a great design with a front pocket. It is large enough to fit several smaller glad wear containers or 6 cans of soda.
1,Not the same color as on the detail page!,"So disappointed and will be returning this. The color of the product on the detail page is an elegant dark-grey with a smattering of green, but the actual product itself is very green and drab looking. I've attached an actual photo. Is it sage? I suppose. Is it dark? No. Is it anything like the product photo? Not at all."
2,A Glowing reiview of a classic band.,"This album typifies the sound of the late 70's post-punk scene in England. The sound is tight, fast, and very energetic. The first song (Meccanic Dancing) is driven by a angular guitar riff and classic hiccup style vocals by Partridge. Very fun indeed. Of course like most albums there are a few duds but still fun. My fave tracks are Jumping in Gomorrah (because it puts religous zealots in place), Red, and I am the Audience which is an electrifying New wave/punk stomper.As well listening to Go 2 you can hear where many current bands (Blur, Bis, and even Green Day) pick up their snotty yet propulsive sound. A great album which will keep you on your feet dancing or bopping."
1,The best worse zombie movie of recent memory..,"Even the most desperate of zombie fans will find this absurd. I mean jeez, a young girl living in the woods with her zombie parents? No, this isn't a comedy. A journalist runs into a local man in a town that she seeks a story. He tells two bogus tales of terror. A man does exercise for 15 minutes in the first story. BORING. The sound, editing, acting, and over all product is BAD. I am a big fan of gore and bloody zombie effects. This had nothing to offer me. I doubt you'll find anyhing for yourself either."
2,Useful,"My wife and I are planning a trip to Tuscany in May 2007, and ordered this video to get ideas about off-the-beaten-track places to go. The video is beautifully shot, well-narrated and contains useful information. On the negative side, though, its a bit thin on detail and far too short in running time. It left us wanting more, but certainly excited about our upcoming trip. In that sense, I suppose it was worth the money."
2,Tripp Lite TMC,The item is well made. It has an easy to understand hook-up and operation. I would recommend it to friends.
1,Was sent a used item,"The item I was sent arrived in an open box and appears to have been used previously. There are scratches along the sides, especially near the outlets."
1,Good-looking but poor performance,"We bought the Crosley Songwriter in October of last year at Linens 'n Things.The remote didn't work, but Customer Service at Crosley sent a new one, which worked fine.As a fourth-grade teacher, I have many cassettes that I want to record onto CDs (stories from the reading series, old books-on-tape), so I used it to copy these over. All seven of the CDs I made worked wonderfully. Transferring albums was equally easy, although I only did one. In both cases, the most difficult part was being present to press the button that manually splits tracks.After a month of use, however, the CD player would only play part of a CD--three songs--and then it would quit, locking up the unit. Powering off and back on freed up the unit, but didn't solve the problem. We have since returned the Songwriter to Linens 'n Things for a full refund. This is a great idea in an attractive package that just doesn't work."
1,"Great idea, poor performance","It worked great at first, then the turntable started playing slow. Same thing for the cassette player. It worked great the first time. Now it is all muffled, if it plays at all. Sometimes when you try to record the machine shuts off. I whole heartedly do NOT recommend this item."
1,Expensive Piece Of Junk!!,"I was actually able to convert some vinyl to digital, but not to the quality that I expected from this Crosley 248. After a few weeks the CD changer refused to open. I can assure you that if you cannot open the CD changer, the machine is worthless. Don't waste your money! I would have given this ZERO stars, but had to settle for one star instead!"
1,crosley crap,"I was very disappointed with my purchase.the record player doesnt play very clear. and the tapes were clear,then the tape player wasnt eatting them. I would not recommend spending all that $$ for something i think is not that good."
1,Junk-Save Your Money,This player was a Christmas gift that was opened Christmas morning. The player had a bunch of screws or something rolling around inside the sealed player when we took it out of the box. There was a larger component rolling around inside the player also. Must have been where the screws came from. We still tried out the player hoping that we would not have an electrical blow-out when we plugged it in because of the components rolling around inside the player. It seemed to work ok. We returned it for a full refund.This item was very cheaply made and for the money they are asking for it it is not worth it. Do not go by the pictures because the one I received did not look like the same wood color. And thats because it is not real wood.I am not sure where this was made but it is typical of the junk that is being made in China these days. When I was a kid this kind of junk was being made in Japan.My advice...stay away.
1,"Crosley recoreders are junk ""DO NOT BUY THEM""","I bought the Crosley recorder last year at Christmas and used it (3) times and the cassette player quit working...sent it back for a new one and then the power button would not work....just got a new one again for the third time and now this power button doesn't work you have to use the remote control only to use it....junk,junk,junk!!!!!!!! Never again will I purchase one of these and they should pull them all off the market since they are getting such bad reviews and everyone has problems with them......"
1,CROSLEY CR248 SONGWRITER CD RECORDER,"THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. , BUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE MFG. STINKS. THEY CHARGE 9.95 FOR 12 PLASTIC 45 INSERTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE 60 FOR $7.00 ON E-BAY. THEY OFFER A BRUSH AND REPLACEMENT NEEDLES FOR OTHER MACHINES, BUT NOT FOR THIS MODEL. THE SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SUCH A PRICE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS FACT.LEN SCHIFF"
2,Very funny movie,"This movie was great it was hysterically funny and is no more tasteless and vulgar than low brow movies that have come out since this, movies that make this movie look pretty tame! I don't like movies that I feel cross the line from funny low brow to being too offensive, and while there was one thing I didn't care for in the movie the majority of it was fine but I didn't feel this movie crossed the line and I just thought it was funny and one of the few low brow comedies that I actually don't mind owning on video."
1,What's the Big Deal?,"With all the hype, I expected to be floored! It dragged -- the gags were infantile and not funny at all! I've got to say this was one of my great disappointments!"
2,The funniest movie I have ever seen!,"I am very skeptical of comedy. It takes a lot to make me laugh. The American mass-media concept of what is ""funny"" rarely, if ever, appeals to me. This movie was different. It was artistically, stylistically, intensely hillarious. Bravo to the director and the cast! Thank you for making me laugh out loud...it's been a long time."
2,Great for those who understand the comedy,I have read all of the other comments and laghed along with the great comments but was a little upset with the one raters. In this movie you have to understand the comedy.. not that you have to be a teen but the comedy is not for your average person. It's for the people that like outrageous unusual comedy like the scene with the dog or witht the hair gel. And the story is great too especially the end where all the guys who like her are in her house. It is SO FUNNY! If you know what comedy is.. you'll enjoy this!!!!
1,What an appalling movie !,"I listened to the hype but borrowed the DVD before I bought it. I am so glad I did - one of the worst films I've seen in ages. The whole theme of guys trying to get their leg over is far better done in Notting Hill. There are about 2 funny moments in this film and even then I found myself embarrassed about laughing (well, sniggering) at them."
2,Loved it,"I love the idea of a bunch of guys being in love with the same woman, and it coming down to the end where they all confront her. And the Brett Favre cameo was definitely unexpected. Truly a masterpiece of comedy."
1,Cat,"If you can read and/or spell the word above, you're too smart for this movie. Boring, moronic, and (worst of all), not funny."
2,I have never laughed so hard at any movie.,"If you haven't seen it, do it now. This is a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh at any cost. From the pizza delivery guy, to Matt Dillan's teeth. You can picture yourself in any situation that occurs in this movie. Watch it with someone you love. Anyone got any hair gel?"
1,What a stupid movie!,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why did they have to make a movie about a geeky kid trying to get a guy hired to go look for his old girlfriend. I think that's a dumb idea. Cameron Diaz is pretty hot in this movie but the whole movie is just plain dumb. When I first saw this movie in the theater I thought it was allright but now that I watched it so many times on video it has gotten boring and stupid. If you want to see a movie that's more funnier go rent American Pie that movie's hilarious. Stay far away from this movie it's dumb!
1,Funny.,The performances were fine but the script was weak as the plot.The good things are the funny scenes that you watch in the trailers and no more the rest is a superficial and stupid story.But the funny are very great I really laugh.
1,There's something about Mary--Something foul about Mary!,"This movie starts out with a lot of promise, with lots of laughs, but by the second half-hour, one is just clamoring for it to be over. It's an extremely uneven movie (although it must be noted that none of this is Cameron Diaz' fault, who does the best she can despite a poor script). The movie is a bore, and a waste of time. What a silly movie- just skip it!"
1,What are they thinking??,"I hate it when they don't create a Blu Ray with a proper master copy! Why the hell would they bother using a lower quality copy to create this??!?! It's just plain lazy. Don't bother buying, as it is obviously about the same picture quality as the DVD you already own!WAKE UP MOVIE STUDIOS!! IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIGH DEF, FROM THE ORIGINAL MASTER, WHY WOULD WE BOTHER BUYING IT IF THE PICTURE IS THE SAME AS DVD!!!"
1,There's nothing about mary....,"I only gave this movie 1 star because you can't give negative stars. This movie is painfull to watch, stupid, corny, and just plain not funny. Most of the jokes have been done before in one for or another. The plot is thin with too many plot twists. The ending is totally predictable, and so is a lot of the plot (even the twists). In short, a movie to avoid."
2,Classic,"Who doesn't love a classic? The only thing I missed were the pictures, but I read it to my girls Christmas eve and they loved it!"
2,A classic tale with Amazingly beautiful artwork,My son constantly wants me to read this book to him. The illustrations are beautiful and the story is a classic. I'm sure this book will become a family heirloom.
2,night before chtistmas,great christmas book. just like the one i had as a child. my kids love it. given as shower gifts and new to be moms enjot the book
1,Text without pictures.,"This edition includes just text, without pictures. Since I was buying this to read to my kids, I definitely wanted pictures, so I ended up buying another edition of the poem."
1,Poor quality,I was greatly disappointed with this item. Nearly every page was torn. Some drawn on & some had tape over the pictures. I bought this as a gift and I am hugely disappointed. The book couldn't even function.
1,Book's animotion is barely viewable.,The animotion is very dark and can barely be seen. It totally ruins the book. I will not be able to use it. It would have worked better to just had regular pictures.
1,Don't buy it for the pictures... there aren't any!,"I was looking for this title to share with my first grade class, this is not the one, all words"
2,Great book,My kids found this book very beautiful. The illustrations are amazing too. We definitely will read this book as often as we could!
1,Not great on Kindle,"As far as the poem, it is exactly that. However there are many typos, including double capital letters at the beginning of nearly every sentence. The spacing between paragraphs is large and leaves one and a half paragraphs on every page. Looks like someone took a classic and tried to quickly format it for a kindle trying to make a quick buck for the holidays. Save your time and money, there are good copies to be had."
2,Must have for Colorado vacation!,"I just returned from vacation in Winter Park, CO. This book was an invaluable resource. I knew exactly where to go, how to get there and what to expect. The guide is very accurate and easy to use. If only it could control the weather!"
2,Awesome Book!,Great book! Well laid out and accurate...he has several others including another one for trails that are south of I-70...I have both!
1,Warning: does not cover Websphere 4.0!,"I bought this book for the following reasons:* Seemed to cover J2EE including J2EE, including EJB development for WebSphere* Included a chapter on WSAD (Websphere Studio Application Developer)* High customer reviews* Low price (for used book)My biggest mistake was not to realize that the book was based on Websphere version 3.5 and the chapter on WSAD is based on version 3.5 as well, so this book was barely useful for me.It does have a good overview of J2EE, EJBs and Websphere, so I think that's what explains the high ratings: it is a good book if you're looking for introductory material on how to develop J2EE applications on Websphere, as long as you're developing on version 3.5. If you're using version 4.0 I recommend staying away from this book."
1,"This is a remarketed title in wave of the recent ""Eye"" craze.","This is a remarketed title due to the recent craze of the movie, the Eye, thanks to the relentless bad American remakes of good Asian horror. This movie was originally called The Eye 10. This movie came out quite a while ago and techniclaly it is the third installment of the ""Eye"" series. I am a huge fan of Asain horror, including The Eye and The Eye 2 (The originals of course). However, the Eye 10 has had such terrible reviews I could not bring myself to spend any money on it. If it ever shows up on cable as a free movie, I would try to watch it just to see how bad it really is. I think it is crazy that this movie was retitled for Americans (even though it is not an American movie and has not been remade, make no mistake that this was renamed for the benefits of the Americans through Lionsgate to cash in on the recent aforementioned popularity). If you want a proper review of the Eye 3, google the Eye 10 and read (and weep) all about it!"
2,No whack trax on dis disc!,"This album is live! A silly skit starts out the cd.It is based on the Coming to America movie! Then the music starts out with Rollout,the first single.Overall this cd has better beats and rhymes than Back for the first time.The lyrics are definetely more tongue in cheek.Other bumpin trax are Go 2 Sleep,Cry Babies and Saturday.One very touching song,Growing Pains is his best song yet.Hopefully it will become a single.It is that good.Check out this disc,I think it deserves a 4.5 out of five for more maturity and cleverness."
1,this guy's the worst.........,"Can anyone get this bozo to shut up? He's so goddamn annoying, and he seems to be getting worse with every new album.Stop supporting this moron, people and listen to some real music for a change."
2,Masterpiece,"This has got to be one of the best Southern rap CD's ever released! Luda has both great beats and lyrics which is a great follow up to ""Back for the first time"". My Favorite Tracks: 1.Coming 2 America 2.Rollout 3.Move 4.Go 2 Sleep 5.She Said 6.Growing Pains. Great Album!"
1,shipper sent me wrong cd then did not respond to emails,i waited three weeks for this cd then when i got it the cd inside the case was some bass test cd.
1,Very disappointing,"This book spends too much time on all different types of drums rathar than concentrating on what I, and a majority of people who buy this book want it for: To play your standard rock band drum set. Also, if you don't have any music foundation, such as reading music, forgot this book. It spends a very short time teaching you how to read sheet music and if you don't understand it then the rest of the book is useless. I came close to throwing it in the garbage several times but keep coming back to it, figuring I'm missing something but I've yet to figure this poorly organized and written book out. Maybe this is the 'Dummies' style as I've never read one before. I found more helpful and free information on the net."
2,Cute,"Will help complete our halloween decorations for next year. Have not used it yet, but they arrived in fine shape. WE currently have Snowmen on for Christmas and they have already had people ask about where we got them..."
1,Rip-Off,"This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already."
2,Yoga is such a wonderful tool for children,"Yoga provides such a great tool for children to learn how to understand how their emotions and body interact. This is a great DVD for teaching your child how to relax, how to implement breathing practices into their every day activities and how to have fun while getting exercise.I would like to see more DVD's focused on families practicing yoga together. This would be a great tool for after school programs or creating play time for a few children to interact in a controlled environment.Need to make this an app for your phone!"
2,AN ANGEL SENT DOWN FROM HEAVEN,I can't explain the timeless quality of this album...themagic created by songwriters David Holster and Suzanne Paris
2,Pretty Cool,"Although this wasn't one of my favorite books in the story it was still informative. Rand goes is STILL in the Aiel Waste which is tiring, but his bond with Aviendha grows and becomes love. but this is the book that starts the series sex scenes too. yuck! and there is a forsaken fight! yes! I find the fights between Nyneave, Elayne, Birgette, and Valan Luca or whatever his name is quite humorous. And Nyneave's love craving for lan romantic. Though at the end the when Rand reaches Cairheien, he is suprised at the death of Moiraine and Asmodean. Fortunate for your guessing purposes, it leaves you stumped with 2 questions*Who killed Asmodean?*Is Moiraine really dead?But you will have to read the other books to get more clues!"
2,"Wheel of Time keeps on turning, and surprising","What a series! Started reading based on my son's recommendation. Interesting, once I got going, and it continues to take me places I never could have imagined. Never boring, some loose ends and leaps of logic, but it keeps you glued so that you continue reading the books. This book maintains a high level of imagination, surprises and plot twists. I love that the women characters act, think and react like real people. These women are inteligent, strong, courageous, and far from timid. So far I am impressed and genuinely enjoying reading this series of books."
2,A good book but Jordan is starting to slip.,I thought The Fires of Heaven was a good book. But Jordan is starting to slip. It seems that Jordan is repeating himself. But when I finished this book it seemed to me that the six book was going to be better.
2,TFOH-- two thumbs up,"I really enjoyed this book-- book six hasn't gotten here yet and the wait is almost unbearable. I didn't give it five starts because Elayne began to really tick me off around page... two hundred? Some of it was predictable but overall I thought it was well done, and it's keeping me waiting for ""Lord of Chaos"". Well worth the read."
2,Great series,These books have well developed characters and plot lines that remind me a bit of the Game of Thrones series.
2,A step up from Shadow Rising,"After a couple of chapters to set the stage, the Rand plotline moves forward at breakneck pace throughout this volume and a number of important events take place (including the biggest mystery of all in this series!). My only complaints were that the Siuan/Min/Leane and Elayne/Nynaeve threads moved too slowly at times. However, the Elayne/Nynaeve thread still had some critical events take place. I truly enjoyed the Rand/Aviendha interaction, as I did Mat resisting the call of battle at first before giving in. The last 100-150 pages of this book are shattering, and really serve as the conclusion to the events from Shadow Rising. While it dips in parts, this is a solid four rated book and really makes you yearn for the next book."
2,Much improved,"'The Fires of Heaven' is much, much improved from #4 in the series. Jordan completely eliminates every one of his overused phrases from 'TSR'. No more people muttering under their breath or smiling amusedly at another's embarrassment. (Okay, so the women still like to try on different, outrageous clothes in Tel'aran'rhiod..and they're surprised by someone every time, but no one's perfect)Like all of Jordan's books, this one bogs down a little in the middle..but it's a much shorter period than normal. The action pretty much goes straight throughout. I was left at the end wanting more."
1,Dream is NOT a delirium,"Hobson does not understand the topic he is studying. Dream is not at all a ""delirium"" but a very complex organisation of consciousness."
1,"A different, lesser, Sayers","Thought I'd read all of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries years ago, but never got around to this one before; turns out I hadn't missed anything all that time. Not a Lord Peter Wimsey story, but does take place in the same universe -- there's a minor character who's also a minor character in the Lord Peter corpus, and I think there was a throwaway line in a Lord Peter story referring to this murder.It's a gimmick book: it's not presented as a traditional 3rd-person narrative but as a collection of personal letters, newspaper articles, memoranda, and sworn statements. The gimmick is cute, but not successful: too much of the book (especially in the second half) is carried by the sworn statements, which are sufficiently story-telling to make it mostly a 1st-person story (albeit told from a couple different 1st-person points of view). And as a mystery it's very lightweight, and too broadly given away."
1,terrible adaptation of.........,"a very good book. Much like Bonfire of the Vanities, this was horribly miscast and butchered. How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand. Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director. John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks. On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it."
2,Ideas for Language Arts Instruction,"Ideas and Insights: Language Arts in the Elementary School is an excellent book every educator teaching at the elementary level should own. This book focuses on the whole language approach to teaching elementary language arts. It connects classroom practices with the theory that undelies them.Moreover, what interested me the most is that it is teachers, who have studied children's literacy development who discuss the reasoning behind new teaching methods that are replacing workbook exercises in language arts and not people who have never been in a classroom setting.In Ideas and Insights, these teachers comment on activities, developed by practicing teachers, for reading, writing, speaking, and listening."
2,New insight,This book offers an interesting insight into the writer Vasily Grossman and contains a fine selection of some of his best writings during the war. A worthy publication that brings an important writer to life.
2,A real suprise find at my public library,"Just an ordinary guy who likes to learn about the world by reading non-fiction from my public library. Takes a while to get used to the way the original notes of Grossman are interspersed within the editors explaination of the setting. Grossman truely was the Ernie Pyle of the Soviet Red Army. The editors give me the feeling that Stalin probably would have sent him to the gulags or worse after the war simply because he was ""human"" in his writing, if he had not been so popular as a correspondent for the official Red Army newspaper. If the USSR had broken up after Stalin died, maybe he could have compiled all his notes himself into a great read about the ordinary soldiers and all the generals, but the editor and translater did well putting his notes in order and tying them together to make sense of it for us. Now I'll have to see if any of Grossman's earlier novels are available in English."
1,The thing is huge. Too huge for a car. Put on your 18 wheeler!,I guess it is my fault for not checking the size.It is too huge to put on the back of my jetta.Go Jets!
1,"good for 101 courses, not for real scholars","The encyclopedia is poorly organized, and too many outdated sources for many entries. Extremely bad for Art Historians! If you want a particular site, one must search for it under its location. Not theme or era. There even isn't an entry for the Romanesque era!! And there isn't any for San Isidoro de León - Panteon de los Reyes. While the writer of ""Historia Silense"" might have known King Ferdinand; the writer wasn't a monk at Sahagun!! He was either at Silos or at Leon. Once again Routledge has proven itself unable in doing a great encyclopedia of the era."
1,Gagged,"I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this. If an unknown author had submitted this story to a publisher, it would have been returned with a rejection form letter."
2,My second favourite Vonnegut!,"Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three. (Slaughterhouse-five being my favourite.) It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too. My favourite part is the ending. Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards. Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!"
2,Awesome. And so on.,I found this book thought provoking and hilarious. I really enjoy the writers easy style. The character development was excellent. All these parallel lives summing into one big crazy soup.
1,A Waste of Time,"Breakfast of Champions is the first Kurt Vonnegut I've read. I hate to say it but I was not too impressed. I was hoping for a book that would be challenging. What I got was a book that used infantile humor in the guise of satire to try to impress the reader on just how clever the author is. If he has a main point, it seems to be that we are all empowered individuals and that all others are there to act as robots to interfere/interface with our lives. This viewpoint is just too cynical and cold for this reader. I very much doubt hat I will be reading any other of Vonnegut's works."
2,Vonnegut's funniest book,"It would be hard to describe the plot of this book. I've read it more than 5 times and I cannot explain it. Something about a transvestite guy named Harry LeSabre who sells cars, but not Buicks. Kilgore Trout, Dwayne Hoover. They're all interconnected and in fact everything that Vonnegut writes about starting with Cat's Cradle emphasizes that some people are in the same ""carass""(people whose lives are intertwined whether they know it or not) for their lifetimes. Maybe our lives are not as random as we thought. I laugh out loud whenever I read this book. I read it twice when I was pregnant and had a boy with a great sense of humor."
2,"A Giddy, Existential Delight","""Breakfast of Champions"" was Kurt Vonnegut's birthday present to himself as he reached the half-century mark. How gracious of him to share this purging with the reading public. Dark, disturbing, and hilarious, this novel stands among the finest of the previous century. Courage. Bravo, Mr. Vonnegut."
1,Mixing totally different languages and cultures,"Baltic countries has distinct difference from Slavic cultures and languages, besides they are not in Eastern Europe as so many archaic minds including the compilers of this book consider.Even within the Baltics languages differ so why make such generalizations and throw all these languages in one pot.You will be surprised how similar Estonian is to Finnish as they're both Finno-Ugrian languages. Surely this book ignores the basic linguistic facts and doesn't facilitate the traveler's life."
1,I didn't like it.,I just didn't know what I was getting. I don't like this one. I didn't even watch all of them. The first one was so bad.
2,Best sub drama of all times,This movie is the best sub movie of all times. Sean Connery plays Captian marko Ramius who intends to defect. Alec Baldiwn plays CIA agent Jack Ryan who goes on the hunt for the Red October. Finnaly Scott Glenn gives an excellent secondry perfomence as Capt. Mancuso of the USS dallas. All in all this is a great movie for any one who likes sub movies.
2,Absolutely wonderful!,"""The Hunt for Red October"" is an absolutely great adaptation of one of the best novels ever written. The producer's of this movie took Tom Clancy's masterpiece and made one of the best military action movies ever. While they didn't stick to the novel perfectly, that's no big deal, it's still a great movie. Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin and the rest of the cast performed admirably. Although later films have Harrison Ford and now Ben Afleck in the role of Jack Ryan, to me, Alec Baldwin epitomized Jack Ryan. Sean Connery turned down the role of Sybok in Star Trek V to do this role, clearly a no brainer there. I would recommend this DVD to anybody. I would also recommend the book."
1,Do NOT buy from this seller!,"I ordered a video tape from this seller about six weeks ago, and after about a month of waiting, I emailed the seller to inquire about my purchase...no reply, and STILL no product. Save yourself the time and money and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!"
1,Terrible Picture Quality,This DVD is so low in picture quality it is not worth purchasing. It looks like a used VCR tape that has been watched many many times. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Horrible Video Quality,"I love the Hunt for Red October and the makers of the DVD did it a horrible injustice. The video quality is horrible. I tend to buy DVDs for the enhanced video quality, but save your money on this one. Just buy the VHS version and save your money because it is not worth it."
1,"Film 5 stars, Bluray qualtiy 1 star. Film's DVD is far better.","One of very few DVDs I *often* re-watch, and excited to purchase the Bluray version, I am terribly disappointed in the lack of image quality. The Bluray version on my very new contemporary Bluray player and year old HDTV, is extremely grainy to the point of distraction & disgust. I wasted my money and will go back to watching the DVD version."
2,Exciting!,"An excellent portrayal of intelligence and cunning by Sean Connery. The movie is both exciting and thought provoking, very entertaining."
1,Do not buy this!,Great movie (as we all know) but the BluRay edition if horrible. We can barely make out the audio even with the TV turned up double the volume. Save your money!
2,The Hunt for Red October,"Great movie, Sean Connery played his role outstandingly.The Hunt for Red October (Special Collector's Edition)"
1,Not As Advertised,"In building out a DC powered rack,we were looking specifically for a 12VDC powered rack-mountable switch. The unit arrived as a 9V, with attached documentation ""included power supply as required"" in the specification. So we threw it out, and have ordered a different unit. For a home user, it would make no difference... but if a unit is advertised with power supply specs, then I expect to receive same."
1,Shallow and boring!,"I ordered 5 books including this one, and all of them are so very shallow, low level and boring.Some of the chapters were actually copied in several books! Unbelivable.I would probably recommend this series to school children interested in management - nothing more than that."
1,Bridgmans Books,"I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."
2,A Personal Note From the Author . . .,"Nobody could have anticipated the recent events ever happening to our country. My heart and prayers go out to everyone involved including those watching from their homes that wish to help. I pray for you daily. I also urge you to help with your prayers and to find Jesus if you haven't already.In light of what has happened to our country recently, I cannot begin to stress the importance of the subject matter contained in my book and books like mine. If you are searching for answers about a God that loves you, cares unconditionally for you and judges you based on your actions while on this earth, then this is one of the books for you. Take an adventurous trip to heaven and feel what it might be like to fly with angels. While you're there, pray for your salvation and those around you. If you are inclined to do so, pick up the Bible. I will glady take a backseat to that book any day.God bless."
2,Geek Humour at it's best,"Snaggy and Nitrozac show their teeth in this wonderful display of Geek Comedy. Whether you're a geek, or not, you can't help but laugh at the comic misfortunes of Windows users, Linux users and Mac users alike as they try to live in a world full of people who have normal sleep patterns, and have no idea what it's like to have a 3:00 AM call from your boss screaming at you begging to know why the third line of the second paragraph on page 5 of the online catalog isn't bold, or why the server is returning an error. Prepare to stretch your laughing muscles when you buy this book. A must have for all geeks. Makes a great gift, and will never let you down when you need a pick me up. Buy two, because surely you'll want to give on to someone you love."
2,Very good book I ever read,I found it very helpful to prevent medical errors occured in administration of medicine to patients. It should be read and considered thoroughly in order to give your patients a safer service.
1,Not her best work,"I love Kristin Hannah,,,usually! This book was a bit boring and predictable. I would not recommend! But many of her other books are wonderful."
1,don't waste your $!,"This is the worst product as far as cool mist humidifiers go. I just bought it today. I agree with the previous review...it's just a bucket of H2O with a *wick filter* & just a fan blowing cool air. I, too, thought it was missing a piece or I did something wrong. I just returned a Vicks one as it was too loud & there was no on/off switch, but it worked! I'm going to return this one first thing in the morning. Don't waste your money!"
2,Monster Book,Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
2,Space by Andrew Chaikin,This is a coffee table size book with many spectacular photos from space and from other aspects of the Space Program. Andrew Chaikin has don his usual marvelous job with this book. It is even more than I expected and it was received in new condition on a timely basis. I intend to get all of Andrew Chaikin's books.
1,Lacking high level details,"This guide is missing some essential details that are needed for higher level characters. It only has maps of about 3 cities (it doesn't have maps for Rome, one of the largest, most populated city in the game) and it doesn't have maps of the higher level zones either.The list of nano programs that this guide has does not include details about the higher level programs.Overall, this guide would be strictly for a newbie, if you are passed level 20, this guide would be a waste of [money]"
2,Elvid - That's the Way it Is,"This DVD of Elvis's times in Vegas is unbelievable. I am in awe when I watch it. So much better than the VHS version obviously because of the picture and 5.1 sound. On my bigscreen and home theatre system, it's almost as if I am there in concert. This is a must have for any Elvis fan. What is good about this DVD is that it is all rehersal and concert. Gone is the fan and other footage from the original."
2,must have elvis edition,"this is my second elvis cd/dvd collection and its worth every penny, very satisfied with the fidelity and video recording, very informative history included. good luck"
2,That's The Way It Is,"RCA/BMG, Warner and anyone that sells Elvis products, know that the ""hardcore"" fans will buy just about anything related to Elvis. As to this DVD set, could it have been better? Yes. But I don't really have any big problem with it."
1,LOOKS LIKE CHEAP BOOTLEG,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, ORIGINAL VERSION,IN MONO,THE OUTTAKES VERY POOR PICTURE AND SOUND, THE SOUND AND FILM OF THE AFTER PARTY SEGMENT OF THE OUTTAKES ARE COMPLEAT IN THE ENDING CREDITS OF TTWII S.E.2001 RELEASE, YET WARNER CHOOSE TO CHOP UP THE SOUND UP HERE, WHAT A UNNESSARY RIP OFF."
1,I want my money back from Time Warner,"I just can't help believing! (Actually, this is one of the songs that is not included on this DVD. Can you believe it?) I have no idea how to access to those ""Bonus Selections"" that are listed. I think there must be something wrong with the production line. Read the other reviews, they are all true: all the great songs you like from the original version are gone! To all disappointed fans, send a complaint to Turner Entertainment/Time Warner Home Video and ask them to get things right and replace the ones we have bought."
2,DVD Elvis Thats The Way It Is,"I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus 15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!"
2,Disappointing,The background music is not clear and the CD was a waste of money. One star is too high.
1,Pretentious and Too self-involved.,"I am not quite sure if there is a plot in this novel. It is a preachy novel about pornography and journalism. Xan Meo is more like an idealogy than a three-dimensional character. There is a sense of superficial intelligensia. The novel meanders with Xan Meo's [complaining] practically about everything. Smoker the journalism is a much more interesting character, but then again, Amis has to inject his snobberish intellectulism -- philosophizing everything.What is this novel about? A waste of my [money]."
1,3 Things about Yellow Dog,"1. Yellow Dog is a chore to read - its self-conscious post-modernity, its intentional tangle of narratives and voices, and its glee in confusing the reader make it tiresome from the first sentence.2. You can call me old-fashioned, but I have a taste for finding humanity in at least one of the characters - in Amis' novel, there are about a dozen characters to keep track of and not a shred of heart among them.3. I took this book from the library and suffered through it for weeks, enslaved to my own principles of finishing a book you start. But I was absolutely grateful when the library recalled it at about page 200. It's not worth a 50-cent late fee."
1,"Finish it, then forget it","This is a disappointing work when compared to Money and London Fields and even Amis's shorter works such as Night Train and Other People. The book is all over the place really, but tangled up in the mess are dazzling threads of Amis's sublime wordsmithery. The behaviour of the characters strains credibility to breaking point and by the time you get near the end, you just want them all to f*** off. But maybe that's the point..."
2,Captain Jack's woman,"This is the pivotal novel of Laurens' Cynster series & Bastion Club series. For those unfamiliar with Mz Laurens' writting, it is also a good intro to her writing style. Her character development is excellent & the interaction between the main characters is witty & playful. She gives both Kit's & Jack's reasoning & point of view so one can easily follow how each misinterprets the others actions & thoughts. This novel has humor & wonderful romance with plenty of action both in bed & with the ""bad"" guys. These characters will reappear in subsequentnovels, so remember them! I strongly recommend this novel."
1,weak effort,"The book starts well, with a strong female character but when kit meets our hero she becomes irrational,irritating and weak time and time again. All it takes is a kiss and kit is unable to have a discussion about things that matter to her. Really, how sad is that she is so easily manipulated. I enjoy sex scenes but I'll confess that I skipped a lot of them out of irritation."
1,Poorly written and ill-organised,This could have been a very good book but the author seems to suffer from an inability to identify with an audience that doesn't already know the material.The material is all there and if you struggle through it you can find alot of useful insights...but more times than not the struggle isn't worth it. I can't suggest getting it unless you feel compelled to collect books on Apache or are in desperate need of more documentation.
1,Online docs will do...,"I bought this book, but it turned out that I didn't really have to use much of it. The source program package from apache comes with a complete, up-to-date installation guide, online docs, pointers to FAQ and other info. If you are trying to set up Apache in the absense of any internet access (some kind of a boot-strapping process that someone might have to do in some special settings), this book might be useful. But that's usually not the case, and I wonder who would bother? For quick reference purposes, O'Reilley's Webmaster in a Nutshell would do a much better job for dollar."
1,Poorly organized and the butterthlies is a terrible choice.,This book is definitely a poor read. I got It because I thought the second edition would be a better read. These guys need to learn how to write and organize their thoughts better. There are other books that I'll buy over this one. The trick is to make it simple and have good flow; even the choice for the website (butter*) sucks. This review comes from a guy majoring in computer science.
1,Only a synopsis of info already out there,"I could have written this book by struggling through with installing and understanding Apache myself. In fact, by installing Apache and looking through the documentation, I knew most of what was in the book already. There was no unique information here, or unique solutions to real-world problems. I think this book may save you time in an emergency or in general, but beyond that it's a bit dissappointing. I think the publisher said, ""O'K', let's get two guys, have them install Apache, and write a book about it."" That's just my opinion, though."
1,It's all uphill from here.,"Usually purchasing an O'Reilly book on any topic is a virtual guarantee of excellence. This book is a notable exception. There are many other Apache books available, I can only encourage you to take a look at them. I have worked with Apache for several years, and this book fails me every time I turn to it for help. The on line documentation is excellent and is by far the better choice. This book skips over the essentials and the basics and wanders off to discuss odd topics that have never been of concern to me. Pretty much a waste of money and shelf space. Sometimes I do say good things, go read my review of Advanced Perl Programming by Sriram Srinivasan if you don't believe this."
1,I need something better,"I did not like this book. I think you can do much better with another Apache book. The authors basically wrote a diary of setting up a webserver from start to finish. They seem board out of their mind and try to be funny ever once and a while. They copy the man pages word for word occasionally.I need something serious and authoritive where the authors are passionate about the subject like the authors in ""Unix Power Tools"" or ""Unix System Administration Handbook""Come on O'Reilly, give us a better book on Apache and show us how to install PHP."
2,Somewhat helpful.,This was somewhat helpful in my study of vintage clothing. It is not as helpful for my needs as The Dictionary of Costume and Fashion.
1,Best of Bobby Rydell,"After placing one order over a year earlier, giving up on delivery, then placing a second order and waiting over four months for delivery of this CD, it was a smashing disappointment! These are later recordings of Rydell's great hits, and pale imitations of the originals. What a waste of time and money!"
1,rating Of 1 Not For Bobby Rydell But For This CD.,"This cd is a remake by Bobby of his songs,For years Cameo Parkway held the masters so artists like Bobby and Chubby Checker rerecorded there records how they did this leagally i do not know,but there is no reason to buy this collection when you can buy the Cameo Parkway Collection for a decent price and have all the original master recordings,and Chubbys is out there to.....Bobby is a class act though even to this day if you never knew this story,when Bobby was young his parents would take him to Wildwood,NJ. and he would be singing in the back seat.Bobbys father would ask him to please shut up and stop singing,and said your not a singer,but low and behold Bobby did become a singer and even sang about his Wildwood days.Wildwood NJ is certainly not the same town as the time Bobby sang about it but listening to this song you can relive those days just a little."
1,Rydell Remastered,"This was the worst CD that I ever purchased. Remastered? It doesn't even sound like the same person. TOO much base. The original recordings from this era NEVER had that much base. Judging by this recording, I will never buy something that I know is remastered again. If the rating stars had a zero, that is what I would rate this CD. I think if Bobby didn't hear it, he should, I think he would be embarrassed."
1,"No focus, every bit for every body","This book is for every body, I mean for nobody. Some stuff is so simple even for a beginner as me. Some, on the other hand, are so specialized that I skipped all together. Unless you are already very versed in Unix, you won't get too much out of it. ( Why do you need it if you are already versed anyway?)"
1,My least favorite Swedish Beauty lotion,"I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!"
2,Great Book But Buy the Infinity Reprint Instead,"""Saint Jack"" is a great urban fantasy but the other published book is superior to this edition. The new edition has a larger type font and so is easier to read and contains great drawings which this edition doesn't have. So you should buy that instead of this. I happen to have both books being a big fan of this particular author."
2,What they promised is what I got,"I've been very lucky with amazon since a lot of the times I end up receiving my products earlier than expected. This one I got it in time, not earlier but just in time so I can't complain. Very well paked, no damage, it was good/"
1,"1 marker, not 12.","The description says you get 12 pens, but you only get one. Yes [...] is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid [...] for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good."
2,Good movie!,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and am glad I decided to rent it. It's a classic and must see for anyone.
2,You never really know someone,"This is one of the greatest depictions of a woman gone totally f_____g off the deep end I've ever seen. Which brings me to my point: some women you can get with, use each other and be done with it. And there are those whose diabolical intentions do not come to the fore until it is too late. Lucky for me, I got out of such a situation with minor scrapes a long time ago. This is a great film along the lines of the '78 documentary ""Scared Straight"". As far as the question of choosing between the lovely Anne Archer vs. the ugly Glenn Close...sometimes these things don't matter as much when enough erotic HEAT is being thrown your way. That explains that."
1,Ho-hum,"This movie was okay. The first 30 minutes were kind of a drag. I'm not exactly sure why this film garnered as much attention as it did. I made note of the old style taxi cabs, the big shoulder pads on women's clothing, and the telephones with cords.Glenn Close was quite creepy and did a good job drawing the line between sanity and insanity. When she slit her wrists and wiped it on Michael Douglas - that should have been his cue to run away from her!! In the scene where they ate spaghetti, it made me want to eat spaghetti all of a sudden.Other than that, kind of boring, we all knew she was going to snap, it was alot of waiting to see it happen. Didn't really enjoy the film."
2,FATAL ATTRACTION INTRIGUE,JUST WANT TO SAY IT'S A MOVIE THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE IT. I SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT EVERYTIME. I HAVE A QUESTION. WHAT IS THE LITTLE GIRLS NAME IN THE MOVIE? WAS IT ELLIE? WHAT'S HER REAL NAME? HAS SHE BEEN IN ANYMORE MOVIES? SHE WAS GREAT IN THE SHOW AND LOOKS LIKE A POSSIBLE ACTRESS TO REMEMBER. THANKS FOR ANY HELP OR ANSWERS.
2,"Thrilling, Malevolent, and Brilliant","""Fatal Attraction"" ventured where no other film seemed to dare risk-adultery. This was outrageously successful, and for good reason. Glen Close and the other major actors are magnificent, and the film is thrilling! Michael Douglas plays a man with a perfect wife and a kid, and he screws it up by commiting adultery. He thinks it's just a one-night stand, and that he can just blow off his alternative girlfriend. But, this girl he's had an affair with (Glen Close) doesn't like being ignored. She doesn't like being treated like a slut who can just be used. So, she begins to stalk Douglas, call his phone non-stop, destroy his car, and some very dispicible things which I will not divulge. Something I enjoyed about this film were some of the similiarites associated with the movie ""Cape Fear"". If you're like me, and you love those types of thrillers about pyschopaths, you should definitely watch this movie!"
1,Average Re-Thread but good storyline,"while the Song itself is pretty much a Knock Off of ""The boy is Mine""&a few other things because I can pinpoint where Kayne West gets some of His Suff from,the storyline is interesting.Brandy Vocally though is not as Good as She was back in the day.Her Voice is missing a certain spark.She still has the Cross-Over vibe in Her Material that will always get Her some kind of a Hit but that doesn't mean you are gonna get solid results from Her vocal chops anymore."
2,by a reader/writer.,"This author has the rare ability to get under the skin of wildly different characters to such an effect that the reader is not only entranced but emerges with a deeper understanding of these poor mortals, of which we are one. Beautifully written, powerfully effective."
2,Great Cat,"The catalytic converter did not look new like the picture you see on amazon. It looked a little faded due to shelf life or something but, I did fit perfectly and my car is a lot more fuel efficient. No problems yet and I doubt that there will be because magnaflow is a great company with great products!"
2,Great reading regarding Waterloo,"This book is the intersection of the families represented in These Old Shades and Devil's Cub(Avon), and Regency Buck (Audley). Makes for a compelling read regarding Waterloo and an excellent period romance."
2,The best book on World Class Manufacturing,"This is simply the best book I have ever seen on World Class Manufacturing. It explains the concepts in simple terms, using a short story that anybody can grasp. All the world class concepts are here: jit, error-proofing, rapid build, etc. The book also has a terrific glossary and explanation of world class manufacturing terms. Again,the best I have ever seen. And it has a great reading list for people who want to go into more detail with longer and more technically complex books."
1,Too little useful information,"This book's strong point is that it covers a very large amount of information on java programming. This, however, is also it's weak point. It doesn't cover anything in any useful amount. I think if it covered half the subject matter, and went into depth on the subjects it did cover, this book would be a must have. I'd skip it unless you just wanted to see what java was capable of. It provides a good survey of java topics. I'd buy books on the subject you were interested in, and skip this one. I returned mine."
2,mormonism for dummies,I was very well satisfied with the book. It explains mormonism in words that are very easy to undersstand and it explains our beliefs accurately. It is very well written and complete.
1,Worst Possible Book on Mormonism,"This author purports to be a Mormon, but writes without any authority on the faith. Her writings elsewhere have been gross misrepresentations of the faith. She has no authority from the Church to speak for them, either. If you genuinely want to understand Mormonism, there are good books available. This is NOT one of them!"
2,Hmmm...,"I was so glad to see that this cd had all new songs on it except for ""The Year the Summer Ended in June"", but after listening to this album over and over I find myself falling into the music rather than listening to it. To me, the album started to become background music instead of saying to my friends ""Hey, check this band out."" The musicianship is awesome mixed with plenty of techy riffs and pounding blasts of the kick drum and I like the vocals much better than their previous release, but that is due to production this time around (produced by Devin Townshend of Strapping Young Lad), I still find myself leaning towards the EP for more playability and a more raw sound. However, this is definately an album worth owning and listening to if you like metalcore."
1,A Natural Disaster,"I remember one time this song (featuring Joe) was being played on the radio and after the song was over the DJ said, ""Now that's what I call a natural disaster!"" Then he chuckled and said, ""I was just playing! It's a good song!"" That DJ knows darn well he wasn't playing because I and other people even thought this song was a ""natural disaster"". Mariah was just better off doing a remake of ""Make it Last Forever."" Skip this at all cost. . . Oops! I just realized everyone has forgotten all about this song already. Never mind!"
1,Awful! Don't waist your money,This piece of junk stopped working after two times. Don't bother ordering this because you'll regret it. Hindsight is 20/20.
1,Amateurish disappointment on a major league level,"This book was scrapped together with content almost totally downloaded from software makers' web sites. Not even edited together in any coherent fashion. The same topics were treated multiple times in numerous places. Mr. Roman may be knowlegable about PDF workflow, but it doesn't show in this overpriced, over-rushed, overly-complex and already out-of-date book."
2,Good book for a new developer,"I've been trying to make the jump from hotshot user to developer since my job has me developing applications for other users, and I've tried a couple of Access books that just didn't cover all the bases for turning a fairly advanced user into a developer. I liked this one because I thought it did an understandable job of doing this."
1,"Every time i S@#T, this is pretty much what it sounds like.","I will say that this cd pretty much sucked balls. If i could give it 0.5 stars I would. The track names pretty much sum up the album. ""Kill The Music"", ""Bored Stiff"", ""Pretty Dirty"". Yup, thats the album in a nutshell. No metal element whatsoever. More like heavy punk with a bad-tasting hardcore twist. Again, it's to the drink coaster/frisbee/door stop/TP/whatever else you would like to use this cd for."
1,not a good book to start with,"if you start learning UML, this is absolutely not a good pick. The orgnization of this book is poor. Some parts are reiterated more than 3 times, some are seldomly mentioned.Too many messy diagrams makes readers like me confused."
2,Unusual and surprising read,"Recently I read the wonderful Peace Like a River, in which one of the youthful characters is a Zane Grey fan and writes poetry in the western mode. Remembering that Zane Grey was one of those authors I always meant to read, I located a copy of Riders of the Purple Sage and settled in.Like several of the other reviewers, I found the book an ambivalent read, but one that ultimately hooked me. The anti-Mormon tone is a bit thick, and the heroic cowboys are as realistic as James Bond. The sentimentality drips at times, and the dialog is stiff. Yet. . .the story is catching, and it is fun to see how so many of the western mythic and archetypal elements Grey weaves into his most famous novel. Great literature it isn't, but take on its own terms, it's enjoyable."
2,Great for Heels,"I bought two of these and stacked them on top of each other. They were super easy to assemble and I love that the length is adjustable. I am using them for heels, so they work great. As other reviewers have mentioned, these racks are for heeled shoes. I read another review that said she just turned hers so it faces the other direction for un-heeled shoes and the shoes butt up against the wall. Makes sense to me! As I was aware that they were for heeled shoes and that's what I wanted, I would definitely recommend this purchase."
1,Hope springs eternal,"I would truly, truly like to review this book, in either a negative vein, or glowing positively - thrilled with it's boundless content. Unfortunately, I haven't actually received the book in question, so there's really not a lot to say. In my heart I keep hoping that it will be delivered one day, any day, sooner rather than later would be nice. And, after the headlong rush of reading and absorbing the copious content (it's a big book after all I've been told), I hold addional hope that I will still have sufficient drive to get that real review out the door and on to the pages of Amazon where it belongs. Maybe next month - see you then!"
1,dissappointing,"I expected a mix of some basic information and new sources or ideas, but there was really nothing new here. This might be a good resource for someone who has never been exposed to any facet of financing a college education or someone who wants to go into a field for which the education can be free, but you won't find anything too useful if you've already made your plans, or taken out loans, completed a FAFSA and researched on-line unless you just need a review or the process."
1,Battery Life,I received the F800 in good order and time. The battery failed within a week after first usning it. I was very careful not to leave the unit on after using to insure battery life. Perhaps something else failed but the results were the same - - - in the garbage can!
2,Great advices.,"Internet books usually have an ""expiry date"", because of the rapid changes. This book holds some timeless advices. It is an excellent guide, although on a general basis. The price is attractive as well!"
2,great,"Denzel Washington, John Lithgow and Ice T are great in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it."
2,Hollywood action with heavy drama (4.5*),"This moviecould be described as Cape Fear In The Ghetto - Jon Lithgow matching Robert Mitchum in the powerhouse acting department, though taking it over the top for Friday night movie crowd.Lithgow is a crafty thug who somehow becomes fodder for Washington's ""15 minutes of fame"". DW is a recent Law School graduate with a view towards making a career in Law enforcement. D.A. Lindsay Wagner sees the amateur video of Washington saving a hostage's life *and* saving the life of the perpetrator, so he can be brought to justice with no extra gunplay.Jon escapes from prison, reunites with his Arian Nation buddies, and sets out to do to Denzel what Denzel did to him - take apart his life, piece by piece.There is an abundance of witty dialogue and barbs at the media, which by 1991 had already joined the junk culture, with sensationalism where fairness and accuracy once prevailed.Will Styles (Denzel) makes his TV comeback?"
2,The first movie to actually Shock me!,"I first saw this movie just 2 years ago. I had already seen Pulp fiction, Dead man, Straw dogs, Reservoir dogs and A Clockwork Orange. The hype about there violence was always over the top and I was never shocked, but Ricochet I had heard no hype for, and I was Plenty Shocked, which was a very new sensation. The film is great, but I don't think its the sort you'd want to watch over and over. Denzel is great, as usual."
2,CARLIN...THE CAPTAIN OF COMEDY,"I am so glad I was able to purchase this DVD as I live in Australia where George Carlin is not available. I've loved Carlin since college...and the older I get, the more I appreciate his irreverent, caustic, ""anti""politically correct take on life. For Carlin lovers, I recommend this one. If you don't know his humor, don't stay in the dark any longer! Go get a copy of this DVD immediately!"
1,Only 1/2 the lights worked,"I bought 4 boxes of these lights and in every case, only 1/2 the lights would light up. Awful product."
1,Blu Ray ok movie was not,This is for children with imagination. I watched this 30 times as a kid and loved it. I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad. Kids may still sit through it.
1,ThE NoThInG,"When the villain of the movie is ""The Nothing"" don't expect the movie to have all that much in it. No sword fighting, not really even much fantasy, no swashbuckling, or fair maidens, just a lot of peaking through hole in ceramic dishes, cheap costumes, bad acting, and [bad] dialogue. (It's so bad it will probably make you flinch.) Buy either Princess Bride or Lord of the Rings or just save your money!"
2,This movie brings you to a world of woderful imagination.,"This movie is about a boy who comes upon a book that looks too wodorous to be real. As he reads the book he soon becomes a part of the story and ends up having to save a world of imagination called Fantasia. You will watch as Bastian,Atreyu,and the Child-Like Empress race to save this world of wonder.Its just a great movie and way too good to not watch in your life-time!!"
2,DVD,In a cardboard/plastic box. Mine came with the middle tab broken so the DVD is a little scratched from rattling around. Can't really complain for the price.
1,movie,Bought this item because it was a old time favorite from when I was a kid. Thought my son might enjoy it. Was shipped fast so I was happy with that. However the quality of the movie was not impressive at all. It looked as if it had been a poor copy of an original.
1,"TERRIBLE job, Warner Home Video!!","BOOOOOOOOOO....How bout the studio actually get's the director involved w/ this blu-ray release instead of just releasing a bare-bones one? Apparently Wolfgang Petersen wasn't even acknowledged of the blu-ray release, which he says he would've loved to have been involved with, see article: [...]Not even worth $5, let me know when a worthy version with some involved extras hits shelves."
1,nonononononononononononononono,I suppose most of you who are raving on haven't read the book. If you do you'll realise the movie is trash. It stops where the book actually begins! Whoever made this movie just ddn't get what the book was about - it has so much depth!!!! The movie is just superficial special effects. Forget it! The movie ends with someone saying how many wishes Bastian gets to have fulfilled. The book shows just how furtile the entire proces of wishing is; it is a mystical tour-de-force. The book is 10 million times the calibre of a cartain litle wizard who is getting too famous for the good of him. It has depth. It has everything. Read it! ANd forget this movie.
1,Zero stars. Please don't buy this.,"I'm flabbergasted that they put the dumbed-down tv version of this movie on dvd and not the theatrical version. They took scenes out, changed scenes and dubbed dialog to create this mess of a dvd. Not only that, but the movie looks funny. The aspect ratio they used makes the movie look weird. I was eagerly waiting for this funny, well-done movie to be released on dvd and I am bitterly disappointed at this made-for-tv garbage. This tv version will only appeal to an unsophisticated mass audience.Attention Warner Home Video: If you are reading this, you need to issue a press release in which you apologize for this garbage and then announce that you will release an uncut version of the movie on dvd."
2,Talk about a classic...this is definately one!,This movie is one you will want to watch over and over again. It is an 80's classic and has far outlived it's decade.
2,This book is good on what it hits.,"But it focuses on IP routing. This book contains lots of information on analyzing IP routing processes but other than the includion of IS-IS, there are no non-IP routing protocols covered. A more appropriate name for this book would be ""Cisco Router IP Configuration: Answers!"". Extra credit is given for not taking 10 pages to explain a simple concept like most technical books do today. Keeping it short and to the point brought my evaluation up from 3 stars to 4."
1,Mesmerizingly Dull,"If you have ever been cornered by an innkeeper or B & B owner whose life contains five minutes of interesting tidbits, but who takes two hours dragging you through a poorly synthesized tale, you've already had the experience of reading this book. To make matters worse, the quality of writing and tone are comparable to a sixth grade essay along the lines of ""What I Did on My Summer Vacation.""If you are looking for an interesting book about life as an American in the Caribbean, try Herman Wouk's semi-fictional ""Don't Stop the Carnival."""
2,Please book the 1st flight to Anguilla!,"If you have had the good fortune to visit Anguilla this is 'must reading'--you'll want to savor every word, every moment--but alas you'll spoil the pleasure by reading this in a day. For those 'wanabees' do yourself a great favor--buy the book. The Blanchards have written a very entertaining account of their business beginnings--you'll feel the trials and tribulations but with the flavor of a delightful rum punch, warm sun in your face and trade wind breezes always at your back---""when's the next flight???"""
1,Never mind,"I ordered this chandelier for a small bathroom. I was very pleased with it when it arrived, but when my husband tried to assemble it he found that the parts didn't line up correctly. It was impossible to assemble and we returned it. Happy with Amazon's return policy, though."
1,Too gaudy,Item arrived quickly and was well packaged.Bought this light fixture for our daughters room. It's cute but the larger plastic crystals are too big and so they all hang close together and overwhelm the overall look/feel of the light fixture making it entirely too gaudy and cheap looking. The same goes for the matching table lamp.
2,catchy story!!,"at first i doubted it'd be like old-foggie style and really boring, but the story is really catchy!!! i really love the ups and downs in the plots and the way the author portraited it!! and without Goldman's abridgement this book would be nothing!"
2,Fantastic book - and more!,"I love this book. I love this film. It is a rare gift to love both a book and the film made from it, but for many of us it is true of this combination. If you love the movie, read the book. And read this edition! Although I already own the paperback, I bought this new Kindle edition. I didn't know it would have bonus features - like the wonderful introductions to the 25th and 30th anniversary editions. The visit to Florin. The tour of the Morganstern Museum. Goldman is an amazing writer. So clever. Give yourself time to sit back and enjoy this book."
1,The Princess Bride 1st (first) edition Text Only,"I ordered and received a copy of The Princess Bride. It was represented to be a first edition which is why I bought it, yet it was not a first edition. It was published in 2003. The first edition was published in 1973, a thirty year difference.It was an excellent copy of a third edition."
2,I love this book!!,"This is a book everyone can enjoy It has Action, love, and is just a great book. I hope everyone will read it!!"
2,The BEST book ever written!,"I am 14 and this is my favorite book. It has everything a book should, and on top of that the writing could not BE any better! It's exciting, it DOES have a plot, a very good one at that, great heroes, great villains, and Great Humor. In a few words: The Best Book EVER!!!!"
2,Who are you people?,"It's been some time since I read this book, but I browsed these reviews when I recognized the title. Goldman writing is excellent, and yes, its a good story, but you can get the story from the movie in under two hours. The book is quite complicated with an excellent, almost cynical theme. It deals with an adult's reflections on the fantasies of his childhood from the perspective of the grownup world. Life isn't fair, and everyone lives happily ever after, until. . . . Still and all, the narrator feels obligated to tell the ""good parts"" of this fictional history, showing the continuing allure that our youthful fantasies still hold, and our wish that life could be a fairy taleJust for the record, of course Morgenstern, Guilder and Florin aren't real. Where did you learn history and geography?"
2,"That rare thing, a hard-to-find cult book that made it big","Years ago, I was fortunate to the dueling chapter of ""The Princess Bride"" published separately in a book called ""The Best of All Possible Worlds"" by Spider Robinson. It was, bar none, the finest, funniest fencing scene I had ever read, and I burned to read it. I searched nonstop for 6 months, haunting used bookstores and calling in favors from multi-national friends before I finally found a dog-eared copy with half the cover gone.It was fantastic. Everything I had hoped for, all the humor and adventure and even some deep stuff in there about the human spirit and True Love, combined with the flush of discovery and triumph.A year later the movie came out and the book was everywhere. Ah, well.If you enjoyed the movie you cannot help but fall in love with the book. It remains one of the few I re-read every year and I continue to loan them out to friends and family."
2,"An all-time favorite, read the book, watch the movie","Ok, so both the book and the movie can be a little sappy, some might say corny, but it's one of those in my collection that I have read multiple times. I've even purchased copies for friends and family. It's a light-hearted, feel-good story with all the good parts. Good guys, bad guys, love, romance, greed, envy, swashbuckling, great derring-do, betrayal, and more. But, it's true claim to fame is: True Love. Read the book, and you'll understand."
1,"For once, the movie was better than the book","I love ""The Princess Bride"" as a movie, so I thought I'd like the book. I was so wrong.I slogged through it, hoping it might get better, and was disappointed the whole way through. Maybe someone else might find its sexist tone ironic or funny. I found it distasteful."
2,GREAT READ!,"This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since 1997, and still look forward to reading it more. Although Goldman's little inserts get pretty annoying from time to time, he writes it in a font that you can skip over if you wish. I am truly glad that Goldman decided to edit this book, otherwise, i don't think anyone would be able to get through it! The movie follows the book very closely, but the book gives more detail and background about Fezzik and Inigo! This is my favorite book, and i hope you all enjoy it as well!"
1,"I liked the real book, but the abridgement leaves stuff out.","The actual book is good, but I think the abridgement leaves out too much. I understood what was going on, but the book could have been much more interesting if few or no passages were removed."
1,Not really...,"I loved the princess bride. I liked the movie and I own the book. I loved the book so much I got it on my kindle too. But, being the idiot that I am, I didn't look at the authors name. So I started reading it and found this guys biography. Well fine, I thought, just a little authors note, so I just skipped past it. I read on. Suddenly I found an APOLOGY for the little notes found in the parentheses. I knew the original. I knew these notes were more then authors note, it is this guys personal biography written into the story! I think it absolutely ruins the story. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is such a great story."
1,The Princess Bride by William Goldman,"I was very disappointed in this book. William Goldman totally ruined it for me. He opens with 31 pages of a long, boring, rambling, collection of his comments about the Princess Bride story. Additionally he gives a page of his ridiculous comments at the beginning of each chapter. He really ruined the story of the Princess Bride for me. I would never have bought this book if I had known this edition was about William Goldman and The Princess Bride is treated as a side story."
2,Book club,"My neighborhood book club read for November. I enjoyed reading it, I saw the movie in the theater many years ago."
2,"Always an adventure,the first time or the fiftieth","In my short life, I have not found another book that can capture ones imagination. The perfectly woven tapestry of details and adventure keep you on the edge of your. . .seat! I have given it is as a gift, and my friend rewarded me by saying it was the best gift they had ever received. I can only say ""Thank you"" to the authors."
2,Did the Trick,This book was a great help when I decided to take on the task of developing my company's database! It showed me all the tricks and tips that I needed to get the job done.
1,I don't know what shape person this is supposed to fit...,"This jacket is basically just a windbreaker, and an uncomfortable one at that. My biggest issue is sleeve length. Does the manufacturer think people's arms end at their waist?? If I bend my arm the sleeve chokes up all the way to my elbow! What a joke..."
2,Nice,"Well made jacket. Rugged, fits well, insulated without weight. My husband was very pleased with it. This was a hit."
1,Good songs but technically flawed recording.,"While the 2 CD set contains some good songs, the way the CDs were produced shows serious lack of attention to quality. There are considerable differences in both sound volume and tonal range, and while some pieces are clear and vibrant, some are muted and sound as if they were being played in the next room."
1,"Too big, too small.","Although the quality is good, there was no mention of the actual size of this cover. I'm only able to put it over the table, for which it is too big but not over the table with the chairs around it as it was intended to be used. So now I just have a too big cover over the table and nothing to protect the chairs."
2,A tragic tale,This book will keep you awake all night. Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen.
1,A great book... in its time. Check out the 2nd edition.,"This was a great book in its time. It helped introduce me to SCSI, and I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, it is 5 years old now and SCSI has changed dramatically --for the better-- since then. I have been anxiously waiting for an update, and am excited that one is finally on its way in March 2000. IF you are thinking about getting this book, I STRONGLY recommend you wait until the 2nd edition (ISBN: 1886411107) is released in March -- or pre-order it. At this point, this book is more of a history lesson than a technical guide. (PS, if not for the outdating of this book, it'd be a 5 star rating)"
2,great,"The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . ."
2,great movies,"we have watched these over and over. this is a great movie and the price for both movies was so worth-it. these occassionally come on TV but with the disks we don't have to fuss with commercials and can rewind, pause, and enjoy the movies on our time."
2,Good movies,"both like I remember them and good glad the I got them haven't seen in a long time, and i always find the movies i want on this site."
2,Even if you know how to write a Complier over the weekend...,"and no one can teach you anything new, because you already know everything, I still think this book is defintely worthwhile. So if you are new to programming and/or Visual Basic this book is an absolute must-buy. Do yourself a favor and learn a clear, concise methodology from the get-go, before you fall in love with your own personal style."
2,Great product! It is 614,"I have been using GUM proxabrushes. it is very difficult to find in stores. I usually get them at Wal-Mart. But recently I don't have any luck at all. They always run out of it. I am very glad to find it here. It is even cheaper than Wal-Mart. Shipping is fast, and price is great. I have no compliant at all. In case you don't know. This is model number 614. I assume they want to start using ""tight"", ""moderate"", and ""wide"" instead of model numbers."
2,Why make it from scratch??,"I was a bit skeptical about a packet mix, but was very impressed with the end product.Honestly, it is better than my own home made - and that's pretty good!"
2,A lot of fun,"Another film that was showing in selected theaters only - not where I live!!!!! Couldn't wait to get this one after seeing a brief trailer. This movie was a lot of fun. I enjoyed the whole shabang. Easy to watch, great goofy characters, comedy, fantastic landscape, wonderful cartoon costumes, sillyness, and wonders abound. Fast paced beginning - a total improbable romp that is eye poping. Very hollywood, but with a Chinese sensibility.Recommended for the ""noodle dish"" acrobatics as well. Made me want to chow down on those darned noodles!Wonderful cinemaphotography - whats new - Zhang Yimou is an absolute master of cinemaphotography.Go for it!"
2,could be cheaper,"I like the .mac account, but it could be a little cheaper. Luckily Amazon sells it for less than what the Apple Store charges."
1,Forget the storage case,"I bought this saw just to have a handy second saw in the garage. I figured the storage case would be handy, as it would be on the shelf most of the time. The storage case is pathetic. It takes longer to figure out how to put the saw back into the case than it does to go out to the shop and get my other saw. I'd give the case a negative star, the saw is about a 2 star."
2,HTC PM7000 Portamate Miter Saw & Power Tool Work Center,"Excellent product. Good value, particularly because the worklight and vise accessories were included at no additional charge. Packing was not good because the end of one of the extensions was crushed during shipping. Customer service response was excellent, but the replacement part was also not packed well. However, the end result is that the device is well-designed and very functional."
2,AWESOME,"This thing is sweet. I do however wish it was easier to get replacement parts (extra mounts for new stuff) you can pretty well only find stuff online for this brand. But overall it is great, why don't all the brands have power strips on them and come with work lights and a vice? Too bad for the Dewalt at Home Depot, I'm glad i went with the Portamate online."
1,Way to floral,I didn't like this fragrance its very strong and floral. It does last a long time if this is they type of scent you're into.
1,Clichéd,"This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd, repetitive, cringingly bad record I have heard in a long time. I'm just glad that not everyone that listens to it will understand Spanish enough to shudder at each cheesy lyrics and forced stereotypes it contains. Really give it a wide berth."
1,Paradise Lost,"I am innately suspicious of films that were bombs that later develope cult followings which appears to be the case with ""Phantom of the Paradise"" after perusing all the 5 star reviews(?!). I enjoyed director Brian DePalma's earlier forays into comedy with ""Greetings"" and ""Hi,Mom"" and later with ""Scarface"" but this film is virtually bereft of any humor, macabre or otherwise. This film does not work as a good rock satire like ""This Is Spinal Tap"" because it offers nothing resembling insight into that world. It does not work as a horror comedy because it's stabs at macabre humor fall flat. It does not even work as a good comic re-working of ""Phantom of the Opera"". The acting is nothing to write home about. I don't know what is worse, Paul Williams lame acting or the abysmally forgettable song score he contributed here. I guess this film can be appreciated on some camp level but you have to be in the mood."
2,Ready for something different ?,Phantom of the Paradise is a breath of fresh air. The first to give you split-screen and more is a classic love story. And good against bad. Root..Root...Root for the good guy. Hiss at the bad. Is it a nightmare or is it the music industry. Suprise: It's both.
2,High Quality Bag,"I was looking for a small bag that I could use on day trips or hikes. I did not want a huge bag to keep all my lenses and accessories. This is perfect for my needs. I have a Konica Minolta 5D with a 28-75 f2.8 lens attached, along with a 18-70 and a 70-210. I can fit the camera, lenses, my battery charger, and various cables. The lenses fit with their hoods on backwards. There are a couple of small pouches to keep extra battery and cards. Two features I really like: 1) the micro fiber cloth that lies across the camera's lcd to protect it from scratches and 2) the top of the bag opens from the back for quick access to the camera.Small enough to carry all day, big enough to fit the essentials needed for a great day of shooting."
2,"This completes the Kindle ""Nuala Ann"" Collection!","I originally had to buy ""Irish Lace"" in a print edition because it was the one Greeley novel missing from the Kindle collection of ""Nuala Ann"" stories. I'm glad that the omission of this second novel in the series was finally corrected. It carries on from Nuala's arrival in Chicago at the end of ""Irish Gold"" until her engagement to Dermot Coyne prior to ""Irish Whiskey"". It's nice to have all twelve novels in the series available on my Kindle."
2,"As good as ""Gold""","Continuing the saga from ""Irish Gold,"" Nuala and Dermot once again find themselves solving a mystery. However, the true mystery that is unfolding is the one surrounding their relationship. Greeley works his magic again making it difficult to put this one down. In fact, it took me only a week to read it. And I would recommend it to anyone. But, first read ""Irish Gold"" so you will fully understand and appreciate Nuala and Dermot."
1,Junk,Optima battery is garbage.. mine failed in 2 years and optima wont honor warranty because I bought it from amazon.
2,awesome.,"This is an awesome battery. The only negative is the install into my 2006 Hummer H3 was a bit tricky because it sits weird in the battery box. Its not level and doesn't look right, but after pulling it out and trying to install it many different ways thats the only way it fits in the battery box. Definitely worth the money."
1,Viewer BEWARE! This is not a Horror Movie or even a good movie for that matter,"My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think....""Horror Movie"" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned."
1,Started interesting,"It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called ""Tall Man"" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one."
2,Warming to the cause,After reading the first of this series I decided to jump straight into the second book and was glad I did. Following the various characters and their adventures without to much back-writing to introduce the characters for those who had not read book 1 was a great advantage to being able to follow the story into this second book. The story continues without too many new characters to hold up the continuity. And so the adventure continues.
2,Not as great but still very good,"I was a little disappointed in the sequel, but still felt compelled and interested in finishing the book. I loved every part of this book from beginning to end. Even though, at times, I felt frustrated by some of the slower movements in the novel. Still an excellent read though"
2,Jordan takes off,"While I enjoyed the prequel, Eye of the World, the second book far surpasses it. Unlike Eye, the Great Hunt gives no hint of ripping off Tolkien in plot, and the book benefits tremendously for it. Jordan is a master of running multiple plots at once. However, one thing he didn't abandon was his ability to describe things. His attention to little detail, like how houses are built differently in different countries, is the leading factor in his ability to make his world real. If his books keep this pace, this series may yet out do Tolkien."
2,Roads To Koktebel was ANOTHER great Art House Film,"I agree that the pace was slow, but the story was very well drawn out for viewers. I look for films like this because, again, it was more about the disturbing (and somewhat depressing) story than 'the stuff that happens between the special FX'.Hollywood doesn't seem to make cool movies like this anymore (Except for ""The Road"")This wasn't the best film I've seen, but it was a welcome 'Change of pace' film, who's style seems to be disappearing. At least in the US.Spasibo and Do SvidaniyaJSIf anyone is interested, see if you can find (and watch) ""Lilya 4-Ever"" (or, depending where you look, ""Lilja 4-Ever"") w/ Oksana Akinshina ...it's a 'sad ...but very real' story"
1,Lame,"This movie drags on and on, leaving you depressed. I couldn't even finish watching it, I was so bored by 3/4 of the way through."
1,Como arreglarlo,Esperaba mucho de este juego... lamentablemente cuando por fin llego venia con las 104 cartas.. de color verde!!!.. sin artefactos ni los otros decks...que lamentable que no pongan atención en esta manufactura... ahora tengo un juego inservible.. a la basura los 25 dlls
2,wonderful toy for preschoolers,"My daughter just loves Little Leap - she considers him her friend. We spend hours playing with Little Leap. She has learned the alphabet and loves to sing along with Little Leap.She gets so excited when Little Leap asks her to pick the next letter and she gets it right. It is teaching her so many concepts relating to pre-reading. She is able to identify letters and is very proud of herself.Thank you for such a wonderful, fun toy."
1,Makes too much noise!,"The sounds that the frog makes are very ""tinny"" and it is hard to understand what he is saying. I need to look at the letters/picture buttons in order to understand the corresponding sounds. Although this toy turns itself off, all you need to do is touch it or have something bump into it for it to go back on again. Needless to say, it is a very annoying toy and I see little educational value."
2,This Diverter Draws Attention,"This is THE best diverter -- primarily because it is the valve AND trim in one!! I will, however, caution you to know whether or not you will need an extension kit (sold separately) to ensure that it is a perfect fit against your wall."
1,What a disapointment :(,Didnt like this series at all ... cheap production very disapointed.... would send back if I could ....would cost me too much in postage ... dont buy :(
2,Vermeer's Genius Revealed To All,"This was the most interesting treatment of art and artists that I've ever been exposed to. The various art experts that appeared in the film went into great detail about the techniques used by Vermeer to obtain his wonderful lighting effects even showing, via infrared photography, that the artist had moved certain elements of the composition to make a more pleasing and focused work. A truly inspiring video. I can only hope that the other parts of this series come close to this level of detail."
1,A Great Disappointment,"After looking forward to this recording with much fervor, I was very disappointed to hear the final result. The sound quality throughout is poor (the mike shorts out during Lou Reed's ""Berlin,"" for which the liner notes apoligize), but other tracks are muddy, too, especially the encore, ""All Tomorrow's Parties,"" which is further ruined by the voice of a woman offstage taking during the performance. Also, Nico suffers from an embarrasingly long coughing fit after she finishes ""Janitor of Lunacy."" Each of the trio have about one good song each (""Waiting for the Man,"" ""Ghost Story,"" and ""Femme Fatale""). The two ""Bonus Tracks"" are an insult to the consumer, just throwaway pieces that are not even complete songs, badly recorded. Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one. The letdown of the year, and it's only Februrary!"
2,WHAT?,"These are great songs but I agree with earlier reviewers. This is not a greatest hits album. Why so few tracks over 2 cds? Roll With It, Whatever, Stand By Me, All Around the World, Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, It's Good to Be Free and Round Are Way are all BIG omissions. Especially Little By Little."
2,great shipper!,I had to purchase this book for my daughter's AP Biology class. The book was just as described. Excellent condition and everything included. I received the shipment promptly.
2,Out of Exile,"A moving story of a life of the mind by one of Indonesia's seminal political thinkers and actors, it is a very human story of exile, love, love betrayed and loyalty to values we all claim to uphold written by someone who actually did so."
2,Wife loves it... which makes me happy,"Got this for my wife's Christmas gift last year. She loves it. It matches our other bedroom furniture too. I was impressed because it wasn't as cheaply made as some of the comps. I was hopeful the back would be decorative as well, but it's not. No matter, no one sees that side anyway. Overall we're happy with it (I'm happy 'cause she's happy - that's how it goes) :)"
1,Disappointing!,"Although Juliette Binoche and William Hurt turn out imaginative perfomrances, this movie lacks dimension and reverts to the standard shrink/patient sketches through the middle of the movie that will have you sleeping on the couch. There was just not enough new material in the script to turn this into the comdeic romance that it should have been although it starts and ends well."
1,Aikido is not a sport,"Aikido was never meant to be a sport and has never even considered itself to be. True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition. The founder himself and his family have always shared this view and rightly so. 2 stars for the knowlege that might be attained for the positive use and understanding of the art."
2,A really good young song writter,"My girlfriend and I went to go see Jessica Simpson in concert and Ryan opened up for her and everbody loved him. He played about five songs and all of them where great they had great song writting and the music was very catchy and he has a great voice I really like ""Shame On Me"" on the new album I cant wait til his CD comes out Ryan is going to be the next big thing look out for Ryan Cabrera and buy two of his CD one for home and one for the car."
1,meh just buy the whole album,which has 11 other songs just as good as this one. Just buying the single is a waste of money.
1,worthless,"I was very displeased with this book. It is shallow bunch of trite, short notes on various seemingly uninteresting people. It's like ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" only worse."
1,Yawn...,"After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer."
2,What are the critics thinking?,"I don't know who wrote the reviews panning this book. I thought it was GREAT! The history was NOT inappropriate, and I found myself laughing alous, especially at Richard's family. It reminded me of Julia Quinn and Kasey Michaels--top-notch romantic humor. I can't wait to read the sequel, and I hope those who disliked the first give the second a chance to change their minds."
1,Don't waste your time,"Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I think the author may have been going for a satire of the Scarlet Pimpernel story, but this book is dreadful. Clichéd characters, people who speak and act like 21st century characters in a 19th century setting. Laughable dialogue, a contrived storyline, from start to finish there is nothing to recommend the book.I thought I was getting a good historical fiction, what I got was a bad romance book and most unbelievable of all to me is that this appears to be the first of a series.With all the wonderful writers out there, the fact that this book was even published is astounding."
1,How disappointed can a Book Club be?,"Based on a review of this book, my book club decided to read it. When we then got together for our monthly meeting to discuss the book, our meeting quickly turned into a meeting of laughter and unbelief. How in the world did Miss Willig get this book published? Unfortunately, we all agreed that it is by far, the worst book any one of us has ever read. Between the 'zaps' and 'thumps' and so on, we were not sure if we were reading a cartoon. The vocabulary is not of the times, and the manner of writing is not only boring, but it detracts from a story which perhaps has potential. Between the 12 of us in the book club, we might have read the whole book. Our suggestion is, please don't write the next book!"
1,Dumb.,"As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering."
1,Silly story,I read it quickly and thankfully it was soon over.Not much to the story except to highlight how one teacher dealt with her midlife crisis.Sky61
2,Christmas Would Be Just Another Day without Brenda Lee!,"This is a great CD. But of course all Brenda's are. If you aren't in the Christmas mood, put this CD on and you'll feel the spirit of Christmas right away. The Angel And the Little Blue Bell will be sure to give you a tingle. I just love this song. Although I like the standards, it is nice to have fresh songs like Strawberry Snow and Marshmallow World. Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without the dynamic Christmas music provided by The One and Only, Brenda Lee!"
2,Obsessed,After just one show of Dexter I was hooked! Every season seems to get more and more interesting. I love this season and this show!
2,Great series!,I bought the first 3 seasons for my son and ended up enjoying it too. I can't wait until the newest episode airs tonight.
2,Dexter Blu-Ray,"I haven't watched it yet, but, if it's as good as the first two seasons, I'll be happy. Delivery was prompt and packaging secure."
2,The series that keeps you coming back for more!,We've been watching this from Season One to Season Seven. It's truly awesome. Every season just gets better. You'll love all seven seasons from beginning to end. Don't miss any of them.
2,The best TV show ever,I have seen both season 1 and season 2 of Dexter and just can't wait for the third one to come out on DVD as this is our prefered way to watch it because my husband and I become so hooked we can't wait a whole week for the next episode to come on. We would watch 5 or 6 episodes in one night.It is by far our favourite TV show full of suspence and twists.Highly reccomended to all.
2,Love Dexter,"I have watched Dexter since the first show on the network stations. That got me hooked! When I learned that I could purchase the DVD's on Amazon I just had to have them. Amazon.Com has been great! What I like about Dexter is the fact that he lives a regular life while having this one secret! I watched Michael C. Hall on Six Feet Under and loved the part he played, I think he is great!!!"
1,Just not getting it,"Since many languages are based from the Latin, I felt it would be a great base. I'm having a little trouble getting into this one. I think it's because I'm just not quite ready for this particular style. I should have gone with one for dummies or something."
1,Broke my kindle.,"In short, My kindle froze because of this book.When I first downloaded a sample of this book I couldn't turn to all of the pages but I liked what I had seen and thought the page turning issue was a problem with the sample format. I bought the full version. Big mistake. The book was slow to open and it took a long time to get to locations from the index. It froze temporarily weil I was turning to a page but I was able to get back to home. Something like two hours later when I tried to open the book again and an error showed up. I couldn't open it so I tried a different book that I can usually read. It also showed an error and wouldn't open. When I tried a third book the error apeared again and the screen froze. Now all I can do is put it to sleep and wake it up with the error screen.From the content I was able to see this book is seems to be a great resource. Just don't buy it for the kindle version."
2,Tale of Two Cities - Baltimore / Indianapolis,"This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd! I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense. On this viewing, this Superbowl V was not a very exciting game, filled with turnovers and some sloppy playing on both Baltimore and Dallas but good viewing anyway.I loved the commentary by Bubba Smith stating that since the organization left in 1983, the Baltimore Colts players have been shuned by the Indianapolis Colts, the present Colts have no history of their team during the Baltimore years or don't respect it, what a shame!!This dvd is still a great view!"
1,ONLY 20 MIN LONG! NOT A REAL MOVIE,"Full price for a 20 minute short? I feel ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the entire description, but I think the business model of this film relies on unwary customers like me."
2,Overall Very Good,The cinematography is breathtaking and the acting is great (except for Bergeron). Powerful story. Worth two bucks to rent on Youtube rentals.
2,fleece bone pillow,I love this pillow! I have had neck problems for years and this pillow has really been a lifesaver. It is so comfortable and has stopped me from waking with neck pain. I take it everywhere I go so I always get a good nights sleep. I would highly recoment this product to anyone but especially those with neck pain issues.
1,Uncomfortable,I was disappointed with this purchase. I had a neck-bone pillow for several years that was just wonderful. Unfortunately I left it at a hotel and wanted a replacement. This one was much wider at the spot where you would place you neck. The additional height made this pillow very uncomfortable to say the least. I would not recommend this to anyone. Wish I returned this the first day I got it.
1,The 8th Man episode is incomplete,"I have fond memories of ""Tobor the 8th Man"" from the mid-60s and I wanted my 4-year-old son to experience the character. Since the quality of everything on this DVD is cr*p, that was all I was hoping to gain. It's hard to say whether I accomplished my goal or not. My son has learned the theme song, but still hasn't seen a complete episode.Is anyone aware of a DVD of the original series being available?My best friend has a theory why we no longer see this character on American TV: Ever notice the ""funny cigarettes"" he smokes when he needs to power up? HA!"
1,Customer service,Hopkins EASYLIFT Tailgate EasyliftMy easylif broke after approx 11 months. I read some of the customer reviews and learned that I am not the only one that has experienced this issue. The reason for my submitting this review is to inform others of the outstanding response I received from customer service. They are shipping me a new item and have provided me with a return shipping label for the broken item. GREAT SERVICE!!!
2,An exciting ride!,"I enjoyed the development of the novel and found that I could not put the book down. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy novels, and I found this to be as exciting in plot development as Red Storm Rising. Courtney Suttle took me on a trill ride in this novel, and I highly recommend it. I hope that more people find this book and will learn what I have already found.I cannot wait until I the sequel is published. Get this book!!You will not be disappointed."
2,Another winner,"My kids LOVE the Magic School Bus videos. The whole family has learned something, and the kids watch them over and over again."
1,Misleading material,"I purchased this book after taking the 029 test. I can honestly say that the ""test questions"" in this book bear very little resemblance to the questions on the actual test. The questions on the test are complex and difficult (often taking more 4 screens to present), while the sample questions in this book are just too simple.The actual test is much more weighted toward practical how-to, and toward interpretation of complex t-sql scripts. The MS Press ""SQL Server 7.0 Database Implementation Training Kit"" is much closer to the mark, but still not adequate.More to the point is MS Press ""Inside SQL Server 7.0."" In order to pass the test, spend a lot of time examining t-sql and thinking about how to use SQL profiler. The real test is about SQL practice, and not about the ""2-minute drills"" that this author seems to think are important."
1,"Uh uh, son.",Sorry about tomorrow? How about sorry for this unlistenable cd. Pick up something on Saddle Creek instead. Word.
1,Big Let-Down,"The whole idea of the book is fasinating; I bought it without any recommendations because it sounded interesting. I kept hoping there would be a wonderful ending to tie all of the scattered writing together, but the ending was even more disappointing than the rest of the book. Don't waste your time."
1,Mostly disappointing,"This is a somewhat well written book. Character development and dialogue are much better than in DaVinci Code. The plot is weak, however. The part of the plot set in the former USSR might sound OK to a westerner, but to me, a Russian native, most of it sounds na?ve and poorly researched. You might like this book if you believe in magic, alchemy and easy to convince in general. Otherwise read Umberto Eco."
2,Farm Torch,"This is a really great tool. It burns hot, but is easy to regulate. It is of good quality construction and pretty rugged. I used it to burn dead weeds and grass. It will also incinerate green weeds if you leave it on them for a few seconds. Finally, the long orange hose eliminates the need to buy a dolly to transport the fuel tank. Be careful using the trigger mechanism (not necessary to use it). It causes the torch to go into after-burner mode, something like a rocket launch."
2,Fiesta Napkins,"FIESTA.....what's not to love? These are great, wash & dry well and attractive to boot!"
1,"Price increase, not good for business","Formula, 5 stars! New price, 1 star! Like the rest, off to Costco."
2,Art and Pharmaceuticals,"An astounding, out of print collection of 42 reproductions, published in the Dutch pharmaceutical calendars, with an introduction by Dr. D. A. Wittop Koning, Pharmacist at Amsterdam. Full color pictures will be interesting to both pharmacists and artists alike. One-of-a kind books."
2,Great!! a must buy if you are going to pass,"I just took the network essentials exam and passed with room to spare. The book took what I had learned in the McBook (Microsoft Press Book), and extented it to a ""what I need to know"". I have never worked in networking and this is the first time taking the exam."
1,The manga is better.,"The anime would probably only appeal to fans of the original manga (comic.) For those not in the know, Kimera should be refered to as ""he"" rather than ""she."" I am not surprised the english released changed it to ""she."" though.Not being fluent in Japanese, I can only guess at the plot, but the manga is fun to look at."
1,KIMERA is and anime joke!,"This is the most horrible Anime I'v ever seen! DONOT buy this tape! It has an excellent cover but the story and drawings where worse than bad! I only rented this movie thank god, and its a bad Vampire movie about Vampires from outter space. The women Kimera, looks horrible! When shown naked, which isnt even needed, she has a chest liek a male, nothing at all! Just a flat chest!"
2,Woolf's last novel,"Between the Acts (BtA) was Woolf's last novel, finished but not yet revised before her death in 1941. It is, like Woolf's other novels, experimental. She takes some of her already established techniques and adds new things. She sets it in the span of a single day (i.e. Mrs Dalloway), depicts and parodies historical events (i.e. Orlando). Woolf centers the action around a village play (a bad play, but that is part of the fun). The social commentary on Britain is there, but BtA is far from the ""usual British stuff."" In the course of the novel the reader should look at the actors and the audience, drawing parallels to our own daily acting. Woolf includes a number of literary allusions. See if you can find the use of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the narrative, for example. As with Woolf's other writings, plot is not the focus. Even though she died thinking it was unsuitable for publication (she was mistaken), BtA is a fine novel from a master writer."
2,Pretty good.,"I still liked this book but there is other chicken soup books that are more interesting, such as the first book of the teenage soul. I just wasn't as touched as the other books. But I'm still glad i bought this book, and I'm going to buy the third book. I suggest that you might want to read some of this from the library to see for yourself if you think it's worth buying before hand."
1,"Doesn't compare to the first ""Teenage Soul"" book","I recieved both books for my birthday, the 1st on my 15th and the 2nd on my 16th. I read the 1st one at least 4 times front to back in about 3 months. I'm very sorry to say that the 2nd is no where near as good as the 1st. I got it in November now it's almost the end of January and still haven't finished it! It doesn't keep my attention like the 1st one did. I recomend spending your money on something more interesting."
2,"Sad, sad, sad!","Every time I read a Chicken Soup book, I end up crying my eyes out... not just while reading, but for hours afterwards. It's a great book, but the stories are just too sad."
2,A paper best-friend,"To put it succinctly, this book and the stories within it have become one of my constant companions, a place to go for advice, understanding, and inspiration. It has comforted me in my lows and shared my highs. All in all, a very useful tool for a girl experiencing adolescent turmoil."
2,Almost better than the first book!,"I stayed up all night reading that book and even if I almost fell asleep in class the next day i consider it well worth my time, it was the best book I had read in along time and it helped me alot. My thanks to all of the writers."
2,Nothing lacking,"I'm satisfied with the brightness, like the design. The mounting bracket seems a little flimsy/questionable, but other than that, it seems fine. And unlike some florescent fixtures I've seen, this one is instant-on. No waiting when you flip the switch.Suggestion to the manufacturer...make the switch a little bigger and easier to ""feel for"" when the fixture is mounted out-of-sight."
2,I love Willie.,I may wear out the CD just by playing it while in the car. The lyrics are so amusing and just fit the two singers and their life style.
1,Bummer,Arrived with the thermometer broken off from base. Could not return because of the liquid used in the themometer. =( Looks and feels cheap.
1,Don't bother with this brand,"I ordered one of these buggers and noticed a couple of defects. 1- it was incredibly low powered and 2- there was no difference in power level from switch 4 to 5. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement. The new one is a bit more powerful, but I honestly think this brand is no good. I have ordered the tlc space vibe version many times and have never had an issue. Amazon, I hope you discontinue carrying this specific product. Your customers are trying to give you some good advice."
1,Couldn't watch,"I started trying to watch this and couldn't get more than 20 minutes in. Others my find it a good movie, but it was hard for me to enjoy. Other similar titles I like are Alfie, Californication, Fight Club, Choke, etc."
1,RoboHelp 2000 for HTML Help,"I was greatly disappointed with this book. It is poorly organized, and unclear. It takes an application that should be learned fairly easily and makes it that much harder.When there are multiple ways of doing the same thing, the author lists them in a numbered list which leads you to believe there are mulitple steps involved. Here's one example:""Creating a New Window""""To create a new window, you perform the following steps: 1. Select File, New, Window. 2. Right-click over the Windows folder on the Project tab. 3. Select File, Project Settings. Select the Windows tab and then click New.""These are listed as 3 steps, but in fact are just 3 different ways of doing the same thing.This is just one illustration of poor organization within this entire book."
2,Underappreciated WWII fiction of Panzer Grenadiers on the Eastern Front,"Really good fictional account of a squad of Panzer Grenadiers as they fight to survive on the Eastern Front during WWII. This guy was actually a Panzer Grenadier on the Eastern Front during WWII and by the descriptions you can believe it.This author also wrote ""Panzer Grenadiers"" which is slightly better well known, but this is the better out of the two books. Well spent money if you enjoy WWII and war related fiction."
1,Collapse by Jared Diamond,the picture led me to believe that this was the CD set that I was listening to from the library.It may be my own fault that i didn't pay attention when ordering that I bought a condensed version.Be careful if buying this that you don't buy this disappointing set.
1,Pretty Basic,"There is a lot of the author's rantings about big business and mining in his state. His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history."
2,Five ways Civilizations Die - We are working on it,"An excellent book that details the various ways those civilizations can collapse. He studies civilizations that have collapsed, and extrapolates."
1,Surprised at how bad this was,"Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money."
1,Plates missing from the Kindle edition,"This (excellent) book comes with two sets of images: 1) maps of the places where the different societies mentioned lived (Easter Island, Australia, Greenland, China, etc.) and 2) Sets of plates with 40 or so additional photos. The maps are included in the Kindle edition, although they don't look too god. The screen resolution is too small, so they look very, very blurry and the text in the maps is utterly unreadable. I uploaded a couple of screen grabs so you can judge for yourselves. Can anyone read the names of those tiny little islands? Thank God we have Google Earth. As for the plates mentioned in the text, well, they ain't there at all. That's a sloppy digitalizing job, Penguin."
2,"Important, but challenging reading","Jared Diamond is my hero, one of a small group of writers who've drastically impacted the way I view the world. And this book *feels* important and like something I should want to read ... but I'm struggling. I read a chapter, then put it down in favor or something else. Still working through it. I don't mean to say it's tedious, just not quite as engaging and thought-provoking as I found Diamond's other works to be. I loved The Third Chimpanzee, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important books ever written. So buy this, own it, reference it, but don't expect to be wowed by it."
1,"Interesting, but Halting","An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections. Perhaps the next edition will be better produced."
1,A lot of phaff and only directX 5.2,"First and foremost this book was written when directX 5 was the standard. Now we are up to 7/8 and I assume there have been many changes, at least there are some examples in the DirectX 7 SDK which use functions not covered in this book. The lack of complete code examples or exercies means this is definately not a tutorial and there are no tables to indicate it is a reference book. In fact, the book seems to be a collection of ramblings about directX and computer graphics in general. Maybe this was never intended to be a reference or a tutorial, but either would have probably been more useful."
1,Chasing Ghosts from an Invented Past,"Hongo delights us with his poetic voice and I was expecting big things with this memoir. But doesn't a 'memoir' mean you've spent some meaningful time in a locale and are a bit of an expert on it? Hongo left Hawaii for California at a young age and knows little if anything about the history of the aina. His spiritual angle on looking at a leaf, stream, or hardened lava flow is somewhat interesting but the book lacks any meaningful punch because there is little or no characterization. I was expecting him to reconnect with people from his childhood but there are none. He is chasing ghosts from an invented past and the writing suffers for it."
1,Disappointing!,"I don't like this book at all. A pity as it is well-written, with vivid turn of phrases Miss Laurens obviously applied painstakingly and lovingly. I like honoria, she is strong, independent and intelligent. I just don't like the hero Devil.Devil is the most stubborn donkey I have ever met! He is infuriatingly mulish, not telling Honoria anything, making decisions for her, and making me exasperated in the process. I envision a lifetime of saucepan for them both - Honoria will need a lot of them to beat some sense into this dolt."
2,TO COMPLETE YOUR GIORDANO COLLECTION,"AMAZING. TWO UNKNOWN OPERATIC JEWELS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. FIRST; LIVE PERFORMANCES THAT ARE ACTUALLY WELL RECORDED, WITH GOOD, CLEAN, CLEAR SOUND. SECOND, SINGERS THAT ARE UNIFORMLY EXCELLENT, GREAT ORCHESTRA AND CONDUCTOR. THIRD: THE MERE FACT THIS MUSIC HAD NOT BEEN PLAYED FOR SO LONG, AND QUITE UNDESERVEDLY SO. ""MESE MARIANO"", THOUGH ONLY 35 MINUTES LONG, PACKS AN EMOTIONAL PUNCH AS STRONG AS A THREE ACT TEAR-JERKER. BRAVO GIORDANO!!!!!!!!!!"
2,cannabis growing,This is the most comprehensive guide that I have seen on growing cannabis. A must for any one serious about growing marijuana or curious of the process.
2,5 Stars,"Amazing work, everything a grower ever needs to know. If your interested in knowing how it is grown and how people imprOve the quality of the plant, then this book is for you."
1,New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"The book arrived promptly, packaged very well. Not in as good condition as I expected but my fault for ordering a used book."
2,The best product for crosswords.,This is my second copy of The New York Times Crossword Puzzle Dictionary. I am replacing the first copy that I have worn completely out from constant use. I have over the years found no better assistance for crosswords than this product.
1,Disappointing,"The potential for this to have been truly great is lost by the focus of the film. If you are not familiar with Mr. Carey's remarkable work, this will not supply too much evidence. The acting is fair. The actors who play Mr. Carey and the first Mrs. Carey are just not up to the roles. There is a bit of underacting and overacting here. What a shame that such an important story could not have been told better."
2,EMDR,"This is a must have book for those using EMDR, particularly if you are new at the process. This would be the second book to buy after the basic text. It helps the new therapist see and appreciate how the therapeutic relationship is central to the use of eyemovement. It is well written and makes much clear."
2,"Nice, Barely Used Cookbook","Minus some very minor damage marks on the cover, the book is like new. All pages are clean and intact."
1,For Programming Novices Only,This is for beginners only. Examples and explainations are very simplistic and do not provide the detail necessary for creating a real world messaging application. Much effort is expended providing information on using the Visual Basic IDE and on creating a UI. The code examples also demonstrate poor programming practices. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you would like a good MSMQ reference buy Designing Applications with MSMQ by Alan Dickman. It is not perfect but is the most comprehensive text on MSMQ that I have read so far.
2,Never an IPOD believer..now I'm sold,"I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear, sharp pictures on it. I'm sold! Also, all those folks who advise how this thing scratches, etc. I don't buy it. I've thrown this around my car, my pocket..all over the place. It shows some fingerprints, but that's about it. No scratches, no broken screens, nothing except cystal clear sound a crystal clear display. I love my IPOD Nano. Great job Apple!"
1,BATTERY SUCKS,"So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I orderedone from MAC the Monday of release.It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHHI take it home and charge it for the nightWake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it onand get on with my day, by 10 AM the battery had DIEDCRAP!I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this oneI say HELL NO! I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this backfor you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwedup my inscription, too.....So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge thebattert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AMThis time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hopeI get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am goingto get a freaking refund, this is BOGUSMAC should know better than to release a product that is crap:/"
2,ipod nano 4gb-white,"I love the ipod nano. It started when my friend got one, so I did to. I just got it today, and listening to it right now (Everclear- Father of Mine) and I LOVE IT. The case that comes with it is OK for now.I recommend getting the largest version (Max storage)"
2,It's an iPod --- what more do you say?,"I am giving it a 4 due to the simple fact of battery replacement. I am not looking forward to the day that it simply doesn't hold a charge anymore. But, I am confident that by that time, some 3rd party smartie will have an aftermarket battery solution. Keeping my fingers crossed...."
1,Won't work with Windows,"Don't waste you hard earned cash on this if you plan on using it with MS Windows. Windows recognizes the iPod but Apple iTunes does not. After 32 hours of trying to get it to work, I'm giving up. My expience tells me that Apple still doesn't play well with PC's."
1,No customising!,"I should have paid more attention to the title. It's called ""Administering"" SAP R/3 and not ""Customising"". It explains how to use the different SD functions not how to implement them. Unfortunately, it cannot be recommended to users either because it is too technical and does not explain things in a comprehensive manner. There are some books that emphasise the business process and help you decide how to implement this in SAP. This is not one of them. This book is smack in the middle of a no-mans land. It's no good for customising, no good for users and no good for planning business processes.I totally agree with some of the other reviewers. Your better off with the online documentation.Save your bucks. Don't waste them on this book.Incidently, if your looking for a book on SD customising, I can recommend ""Implementing SAP Sales and Distribution"": 5 stars!"
2,A National Treasure,"This double CD is stuffed full of great songs and amazing stories. My favorite stories are of Elaine's date with Marlon Brando, what she thought some lyric are/meant, and her time in Compant. The total honesty that she brings it all together is touching and inspiring.Very few people have the length or variety of a career that Elaine Stritch has had. I am sure that she has enough stories to do ten more shows.If you love Broadway then you must buy this CD."
1,Disappointing!,This book was so disappointing! It lacked applicability to using the Active Directory.
2,Comfort food and reading...,"The recipes in ""The Country Gourmet"" spin a tale of comfort as well as good eats. The remembrances of the author's mama and her love of food and life does more than feed the reader's soul, it gives the reader hope that there is truly more to life than getting out of bed each day; there are wonderful dishes to prepare and delicious people to get to know and break bread together with. TWO THUMBS way up for this amazingly inspiring cookbook/biography chronicling a daughter's love for her mother and her mother's cooking."
1,It had it's good moments,"I'm not sure what to say about this book, I THINK i liked it... it's about a woman who wants to start out somewhere new, and on the way she gets a daughter and meets people... I wish turtle had said more... Barbara seems to ramble on and on... I'm not even sure if i would recommend it... I THINK i would..."
2,A thrilling life size novel.,"This book was great. I was actually made to read this over the summer. When I first looked at it, and a first glance at the title, I thought I was in for a interesting trip in my imagination world.Then I read the back and relized that it wasn't going to be all that bad. I read the book and loved it! I fell in love with the charaters. I sypmathized for the dilemmas they all went through in their lives. It proved that with out really putting yourself in someone elses shoes, you can't correctly judge your own life."
2,An Exciting Read,"Unique in that the narrator and heroine, Taylor/Marietta isn't the typical flawed protagonist who learns self-confidence by getting a makeover or landing her dream man. In this book, Taylor already has a self-confidence that borders on cockiness and is full of spunk. She's a sweet, straight-talking narrator the reader grows to love. Her frankness is something readers will aspire to. Taylor travels to Tucson, takes charge of a young Native American girl, befriends and encourages an insecure new mother named Lou Ann, and meets Estevan and Esperanza, a couple from Guatamala living illegally in the states. The novel has a feminist slant, and is empowering that way. I got a bit bored with the subplot featuring Estevan and Esperanza, but for the most part was captivated. Told in the voice of Taylor, the novel is humorous and uplifting. The conversations are realistic and familiar, very real. Brimming with advice and inspiration."
2,Extraordinary!,"Even a voracious reader (such as myself) can sometimes be unaware of a new voice in the land....I was unaware of Barbara Kingslover, until about a month ago, when a friend of mine handed me a copy of ""The Bean Trees,"" mentioning that I ""might like it.""To say that I ""liked"" it is extreme understatement ... This is a book I wish I had written....It's all about the beauty, the glory, the heartaches, the joys, and the realities of being a woman alive in the world today -- without heavy-handed political harangues or in-your-face proselytizing. Instead, this book is filled with wisdom, warmth, out-loud laughs and a quiet, satisfying inner recognition of all that is truly wonderful in a woman's mind, spirit, heart and life.I've found a friend in Ms. Kingslover. I wish she lived next door"
1,It's all down hill from the Poisonwood Bible.,"The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me."
1,"Asimple REVIEW of us, ROger Ling, RAymond Gao,& Jonathan Bau","Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this ""interestingly unique"" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, ""Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations."" P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality."
1,H8ted it,"I thought that it was really boring, and the struggles that a lot of the characters overcame weren't really that intersesting. I thought that Taylor didn't bother to look at the world from any point of view but her own and was obnoxious. I also hated her friend and I pretty much thought that the only reason that the people's lives were as bad as they were is because they didn't try to improve it with everything they had. They were too clingy. And the entire Talor kissing the married guy really stupid and unsensitive on her part."
2,AN ENJOYABLE READ,"This is a story about a Taylor - a young woman who leaves her small Kentucky town and heads west - hoping to make something of her life. In her travels, Taylor's handed a 3 year old American Indian girl who, it's clear, has been heiniously abused. When there's no trace of this child's parents, Taylor takes on the role, and by the time the two land in a small town outside Tuscon, Arizona, for all intents and purposes, Taylor is the child's mother.Written in wise and lyrical prose, this story is about loyalty in love and friendship, and about discovering how far in life these treasures can take you."
1,A very disappointing read.,"The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background. When Taylor finally appears to break down under the pressure of young motherhood, it rings false, her switch from bravado to frustration lacks depth and disappears as quickly as Kingsolver's references to the war in Guatamala."
1,"Interesting, but poorly explained technique","I found myself rereading several times to try to understand how his ""box theory"" works. The author does an extremely poor job of explaining the most important part of the book as is evident by the questions posed by other readers in the Appendix. He focuses too much on the story and not enough on the technique."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is an autobiography of Nicolas Darvas' life. There is nothing describing in clear detail the system he used and how he used it. Nicholas gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it magically shot up in price overnight and was restricted from anymore trading. He sold one stock that magically shot up for 171 dollars a share, profit 250,000. I don't even think the results he posted were real. The most information you gain from this book is to buy stocks in a strong uptrend and that info is nothing new."
1,Entertaining but not enough details,"I got this book based on so many 5-star reviews posted here. This book is indeed entertaining for leisure reading. However, it lacks the much more practical details in explaning what the techo-fundamental method he used is all about. The book did provide some basic advice on implementing stop-loss, limit buy, etc, to limit the risk. However, these are all very basic elements of trading that all the traders should learn in the first chapter of trading. In other words, the book only covered the story (and some stock trading 101) which do not teach readers (especially the very beginners) what practical set-ups or methods are used to be profitable in trading stocks. This book is good if you are looking for a non-textbook leisure reading. If you are looking for trading methods (either technical or fundamental) that can help you to be better in trading, I think the ""Mastering the Trade"" by John Carter is by far the most practical book that I found in the market."
1,hope for the stupid,"This book illustrates that if someone as stupid as Nicholas Darvas can make money in the stock market so can you.After all, it took this guy several years after he began trading to figure out what the Dow Jones Industrial Average was.Essentially, Darvas used fundamental analysis in conjunction with""stocks that were moving"" and placed trailing stops behind them. Darvas never shorts a stock. The concept would probably be too taxing for his brain.Not a bad system. It supposedly worked for him.In my opinion,their are a few, and only a few, good ideas which can be gleaned from this essentially worthless book."
1,One of the VERY WORST!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is ""How Technical Analysis Works"" by Bruce Kamich."
1,False advertising - avoid,"Amazon claims ""training DVD to teach you all the features & functions & HOW TO USE & MAXIMIZE your Garmin unit"". What can I tell you? There are many many features and functions that are not mentioned at all. I have told Amazon to modify this claim and of course I am retuning it to them."
2,One of many great anime,"Im 13 years old and I love this anime.Why, not because of the action,but but because of its mystery,drama, and deph.Most of my friends loved the action,but they really never understood the concept of this anime.They just kept talking about it.It got me and other people annoyed by it.It made anime sound geeky and people started sterotyping the show and other anime.The show can get confusing at times but starts to come together like a big puzzle.Like the other anime on catoonnetwork people got only half of what the anime could of been because they wanted to make the show for kids.This show isn't always seriouse.It has a lot of funny moments in it.If you liked this I reccomend buying Trigun."
2,"A Must Have, Indeed","While some may call the great reviews given to this anime ""rants"" and such, they're more than that. Outlaw Star is, to say the least, an anime that deserves to be placed on the shelf along with others hits such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Gundam Wing, etc. The fact of the matter is that it's entertaining, has a storyline that grabs the viewer, and characters which one can become familiar with. People who find Outlaw Star not enough to be considered worth owning usually don't look at it for what it is. Entertainment. The anime borderlines between being entertaining and 'deep'. Because of this it gets alot of good reviews, and then some so-so and bad ones. But don't be mistaken, it IS a wonderful anime."
2,Great...,This show is my fav Anime series... its even my first..it has a killer story and very like-able charactors....
1,WHY??!WHY?!?!WHY?!?!,"Why did they do this? why did they make a direct to video sequel to a movie that made money?It screams for a big screen sequel that starts off where the original ended.not a flick that takes a simple premise and dumbs it down,and cant pull off the decent vampire body burns achieved in the original.The thing that was cool about the original was that the vampire slayers were meaner than the monsters they hunted.In this one they are weak and it becomes your average cheap vamp flick.not to mention carpenters good name wasted on the box.And whats with that awful wooden steak gun bon jovi uses,its sad.this vampire flick sucks."
1,Definitely not Carpenter's best..,"Definately not one of Carpenter's (who I am not a huge fan of anyway) best; it was written very lazily & directed (and acted) badly. Maybe it was the stupid/lame title, or maybe the boring plot. Either way, I didn't take much with me except the setting...and Bon Jovi & Diego Luna's prettiness. You know a movie isn't all that good when all that stands out are the looks of the main characters!"
2,Come on....it wasn't that bad.,"The movie wasn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It surely wasn't ""the worst vampire movie ever"". Jon Bon Jovi didn't suck in the roll either."
1,0 STARS: Los Feces,"Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible ""Vampires- Los Muertos"" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, ""Vampires-Los Muertos"" is an even worse movie. Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse. The original ""Vampires"" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks! Definitely one of the worst so called ""horror"" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!! Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind."
1,Dont quit your day job...,"Dont waste the money on this stinker. Jon, stick to your day job of rocking teenage girls and middle-aged housewives. This is supposedly some sort of sequal to Carpenter's ""Vampires"" which totally rocked, Los Muertes is nowhere near being in the same league. Obviously an excuse for Bon Jovi's female fans to see Jon with his shirt off unfortunatly guys there are no gratutious female bod-shots for us to make this movie worth-while. Forget the fact that the plot jumps around so much that you give up trying to understand it and just pray that it somehow gets better before you fall asleep. Take some advice and rent it like I did. Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind."
1,Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldJP,"I Didn`t like it because it makes me feel bad when I read about responsibility. It is also about family value and I like that. So, I give this book three stars."
2,Justin and the Best Biscuits in the WorldEF,"I really,really thought this was awsome because they talk about cowboys and roping.I am not like Justin.I hate the night riders.I don't like his sisters because they were mean.So were the night riders.The Q-T ranch is cool.Justin's Grandpa is nice.Justin likes going to his Grandpa's.He likes to ride horses.One time they found a fawn in the fence!Luckly they got it out.Then they went to the festival.Justin makes a new friend.He Deos 4 actvities.He has fun.And Grandpa won the ""Best Biscuits in the World"""
1,"great music, bad video","If you like the music of Pablo Montero, only buy this if you are a collector, it only has 6 songs, very bad extras and the videos seem to be very bad TV grabbing, lousy video quality. Not worthy of Pablo Montero. Looks like the music company who gave permission to publish this really does not care about a basic standard of quality"
1,Not for those just starting ms sql server or ms in general,"I was presented this book and told 'learn how to set up sql server'. Not from this. Aside from grammatical problems that make it hard to read, it presumes you know all the ms-isms, the microsoft way of naming or doing things (my 15+ years experience is on other systems). Of several dozen attempts to locate a term or item in the index, none were successful. Best guess; if you know an older sql server, or are well immersed in ms and its methodologies, this book might be useful to learn V7. If not, look elsewhere."
2,Strange and wonderful,"Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include ""nudity."" There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical."
1,Ideal for the Web developer new to the Microsoft tool set...,"After reading ""Professional Active Server Pages"" and ""Active Visual Basic 5.0"", I felt like I was wasting my time with ""Inside Microsoft Visual InterDev"". The book is appropriate as an overview for an entry level Web developer that has had no experience with Microsoft development tools. At the very least, I would hope to see significant examples in future editions."
2,Baking Book That Takes The Cake!!!,"This book is full of wonderful recipes that just prove that Maida Heatter is the expert on baking. I started off with the Zucchini bread, which is out of this world. I then tried the sticky buns. My family thought I bought them at a bakery. And they weren't that difficult. Anybody who has baked before will be able to complete them with ease. I recommend this book and her others to anyone who loves baked goods, especially cakes."
1,Magical shrinking leggings,"These leggings were great out of the package. They fit perfectly and were very soft. However, after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost. I wouldn't buy them again."
1,Big Fail,"These leggings sit low on the waist, nothing like the pictures. Pitbull and American Apparel are both using this brand now called In Touch. The materical is thin but comfortable but the lowrise fit ruins them. I am a real woman and I need a little more material for my waist and back side."
1,Shrunk and See Through,"These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality,they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices."
2,Works for Me!,"I've had these leggings for about 2 months now. I wash on gentle and hang dry (like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer). They do sit a little below the waist, but that seems to be the current style and it's not too low. The legs are long which is great for me because most leggings are too short and then my ankles get cold. Not with these! I don't wear them barefoot, so don't know if the long length would be a problem. I really like the price, and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I wish I'd bought two of them as I sleep in them as well. Recommended."
2,Egg shaper,Bought this for my husband. I had a metal one but the eggs stuck to it. This one I thought it would melt but it doesn't and the eggs don't stick either. It's easy to clean. This one is a keeper.
2,WE WERE SOLDIERS,"Sorry some people have been disappointed that this is not the soundtrack. But...the music is a perfect tribute to the film and the men portrayed there. I am a veteran and a close friend of Joe Galloway, Bruce Crandall and many more of the real life soldiers in the story. Randy Wallace did this album for them..and for all of us who have not had our songs sung. Listen to the words, they mean a lot to us."
1,Misleading,"This ""soundtrack"" should have been titled ""Music inspired by We were Soldiers"" or something to that tune. If you want the actual score/ soundtrack of this film, you should look for the similarly titled album but COMPOSED by Nick Glennie-Smith. That CD is truly 5 star material.This album is not too bad in itself, if you are into 60ish songs but the misleading name is highly irritating and misleading hence I deduct one star from my true rating."
1,Excellent movie but very poor soundtrack album,The movie is one of the best Vietnam era movies I have seen but this soundtrack had only 2 songs on it that I recalled being in the movie. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with the movie instead of paying also for the soundtrack.
2,I LOVE this book!,"I initially got Kathryn Marsden's little book on Food Combining which is a great beginner (explainer). This one goes into much more detail but still keeps everything so simple. Once you learn the premise, you can honestly create or adjust every recipe you already have and use. This book also gave information about medical conditions that respond favorably when we stop mixing all foods together at the same time. This information could help keep you out of the doctors office. My friend with diabetes is thriving on this program. You could honestly have more time, money and health to do what you really enjoy!"
2,A real gem,"Just as good as 'Silk Roads', music will immerse you in harmony. Great to study or meditate to, a real feeling of peace."
2,"This album is a ""OASIS"" for kitaro-fans !","When I first came over this album for many years ago,I felt that this was MY kind of music!(this was the first I`ve ever heard from Kitaro)The music takes you away to dreamland,and you get SO relaxed..! (Beautiful!) from the very first note... Buy it,you will not regret!!!"
2,brilliance.,"crimes is absolutely the best album of the year, no questions asked. the BB have transcended all attempts to pigeon-hole them into a genre, and have brought a brilliant energy to the scene that buries everybody else. cant wait for an east coast show, its killing me! experimental genius. maximum ownage."
2,SCAN DISK SANSA MP3 PLAYER,"THE ITEM BECAME DEFECTIVE AND AMAZON REPLACED THE ITEM WITH NO COST TO ME,"
1,The dreaded STP error,"It's amazing to me that there could be an MP3 player that allows one to corrupt it by simply uploading slightly more data that it shows. That's what happened. Pathetic. Playng volume is weak, the display is easily cracked, and now my son's player is a useless paperweight. I'll probably try to get it replaced, meanwhile I just bought anoter one. Search for ""no space for Db please delete 4.0 Mbs to free up space"" and just see how many hits you get. I really do have a hard time recommending ANY Sansa MP3 player when the very basic operation can render one useless; and it's not just this model, just search, and you'll see."
1,anything but an ipod,"i got this b/c i was desperate for an ipod alternative, and it seemed to be a decent buy. my main complaint is that every few days it refuses to play songs that i've downloaded onto it from yahoo music player (it will still play songs i've transferred from CDs). when it does this it asks me to ""plz sync the device"". i still haven't figured out what that means. sometimes if i plug the device into my computer and alter the playlist a little, it's happy for another few days. sometimes this doesn't work. very frustrating. also, it operates on AAA batteries and sucks them down like water."
2,Great Value,"I bought 2 of these for my daughters, who are 8 and 12. (I feared that they might get lost at some point, and I didn't want to invest in a more expensive iPod.) The controls and menus are easy to use and I had no problems using Windows Media Player to load them. They love them and I think they're a great deal for the price."
1,OK if you ignore the FM abilities,"I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow. Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had. Dont by it for FM anything! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works!"
1,I was very unhappy,"What can I say. I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it. I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features. However, after just one month it locked up on me and wouldn't do anything. I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product. This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day. I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player. I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product."
2,Excellent tutorial to Python language.,"Learning Python fills the gap for a printed introduction to the Python language. The layout is natural and methodical. Although I had picked up a good deal of the material beforehand from the online documentation and trial and error use of Python, I learned quite a bit from the book that had previously escaped me. If you want to know what the buzz is about Python or are looking for an excellent introduction for friends and co-workers to Python, try Learning Python."
2,still a good read,"Having read this book a couple of years ago, I still browse through it frequently. David presents a gentle intro for the Python beginner but I appreciate the quick summaries of modules and methods. In fact, I reference this book a lot more than my ""Essential Python Reference"". Buy this book for a good intro to the language and keep it around for future reference."
1,The Above Reviews are Phoney,"It's some writer working under a pseudonym, getting writer-friends to write these horrible, long-winded reviews."
2,Rodan you bet,Rodan is a complete story. It includes people elements and the state of the arts special effects for the times. I have been looking for a clear copy of this film and this is it.
1,You've got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!,This has to be the all time worst sci-fi flick since the mesozoic era. Poor acting. Poor directing. Poor scenery and effects...
1,Subtitles? Original Japanese language track? Didn't think so,"I've always been a big fan of all the Toho monster movies and had been awaiting this DVD release with baited breath. Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing, re-editing and the deletion of music cues. It's time they were seen as originally intended. I've been lucky enough to see subtitled copies of many of the Godzilla movies... all of them brilliant.But these tacky dubbed versions drain all the soul out of them... and are an insult to the great filmmaker's who put them together in the first place. I'm tempted to learn Japanese and buy the official Toho releases."
1,This book is not detailed enough.,You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book. (thats unacceptable to me) I was disappointed with this purchase. Novells online manuals contain far more information and its free.
2,Ironpants for the people,"The heavy denim material seems to wear really well and the workmanship is excellent. For a working man or for someone hard on pants, these are the jeans to buy, for they may last for many years. There are plenty of pockets, but the legs are a little baggy for the average-built person, still they look really nice.Hard-core denim wearers, here are the jeans for you!"
1,Not Nearly So Good As I Had Hoped,"After reading ""Generation X' and ""Shampoo Planet"" I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in ""Generation X"" and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were."
2,Insightful,Thought provoking. I would expect nothing less from Douglas Coupland. He has his own unique way at looking at the world and it comes across clearly in this book
2,"Catcher in the Rye, 20 years on...","This book is for anyone who has reached that point in their life where they question whether there is any logic to the seemingly random series of memories they have aquired thus far. The magic of this book is missed by the editorial reviews. If you read Catcher in the Rye and then grew up, it's time to read this."
2,These are our children!,"How many books can you honestly say made you cry? I cried over these ""letters"" from young people trying to get a college education. They have seen such terrible violence and yet they find ways to write their hearts out for two splendid teachers, Michael Blitz and C. Mark Hurlbert. How do I know they are splendid teachers? I can only say you would have to read this book to understand. Michael and C. Mark write letters to each other, to their children, to themselves, too, I think. There is so much that is beautiful in this book that it's strange to say, also, that there is so much that is horrifying. I wanted a book about teaching that would offer something ""different."" This book offered me an experience that is unforgettable."
1,"so horrible we couldn't endure it, only lasted 4 mintues, so boring","This is not words we are used to hearing. TOO many words, unknown words, Agatha gone mad. love to return this.?? Beth"
1,Hackneyed magic realism,"Hackneyed magic realism - kitsch and cliche.The cover of this edition features a quote from Marquez:""...unmistakeable reading pleasure.""Surely the complete quote must be something along the lines of:""Even Stefan Zweig, in comparison, inspires unmistakeable reading pleasure.""Read The Lizard's Tail by Valenzuela or Ship of Fools by Peri Rossi instead. Leopard in the Sun is unmistakeably dispensable."
2,Dali produces a little gem,"I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june 09. Amongst the exhibits was a 7 minute dvd of a surrealist love fantasy which Dali made in collaboration with Walt Disney productions.This film is a whimsical lyrical glide through Dali's surrealist world. Truly a little gem.I also saw some of his ink and pencil drawings.They depict a technical mastery which has been compared to that of DaVinci. Most great artists are masters of drawing.You won't be disappointed with ""Destino""."
1,Junk,"Mine was dead out of the box. Hey America, you get what you pay for - there is no free lunch. On its' way back, needless to say."
2,Texas slice of life,"Set in a rural Texas town near the end of WW I, the flu epidemic of that year is raging. The movie attempts to capture, in great detail, the tribulations of a family at this period of time: the war in Europe, the influenza, and their everyday routines. Death seems everywhere. A great deal of trouble went into getting the details of the setting absolutely authentic. It's a poignant movie, and we can identify and feel for the characters: the husband (William Converse-Roberts) and wife (Hallie Foote) who lose their 8-month-old child to the flu, and the 17-year-old brother (Matthew Broderick) who wants nothing but to go fight in Europe before it's all over. A very real slice of life, with few, if any, of the Hollywood conventions one might expect. Written by Horton Foote. Worth a watch."
1,Possibly the worst Godzilla film made,"This sequel to Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla makes its predecessor look like Oscar material. Godzilla doesn't appear in this movie until mid-way through it. When he finally does show up, Godzilla seems to pop-up out of nowhere to do battle with Titanosaurus, one of the worst movie monsters that I have ever seen.Being a rabid Godzilla fan, I looked forward to watching this movie. Unfortunately, even my five year old son did not like this installment in the Godzilla series.Poor plot. Poor villains. Poor effects. Not enough Godzilla.Don't waste your time & money on this one."
2,A Must read for students of all ages,"Well-written with rich universal themes, this book is a must read, especially for the classroom."
2,Fantastic!,"I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things, mainly because sometimes the author went on for pages...but other than that, the book was very, very good."
2,The Chosen:Understanding,"in reading ""The Chosen"" i was very pleased with the book. The plot was very touching as we saw the boys (Danny and Reuven) grow from the grounds of a baseball field to the advanced college campus. Their friendship was very strong and was normally able to overcome most obstacles...except for the silence that Danny and Reb Saunders had between them. Mr. Malter brought Rueven up in talking, so Rueven began to hate the silence simply because he couldn't understand it. i believe that that applies to much of life. If we don't understand something completely, we tend to write it off as bad, hard, or tend to hate it. i would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book for any occasion."
1,Over Exaggerated!!,"This book is based on teenagers. In todays society children can not relate to the characters of this book, The Chosen. I believe that I should have enjoyed this book a lot more if I were able to understand what the characters were going through emotionally. I felt the author would help me understand, unfortunatly this is not the case. When I first heard of this book, I thought I would like it, because I too am Jewish. As I started to read it though, I felt as though it were extremely boring. I was hoping for it to be abook were I wouldn't want to put it down. but as I found out I would simply try anything to aviod it. I hope others readers have abetter feeling about this book, and it enjoyed it"
2,A superb story,"'The Chosen' is a story of friendship that considers and is impacted by the relevancy of an ancient faith in a modern world and the clash between the different ways of approaching such faith. The debates within the book hold particular interest for religions in which faith tends to also become a culture and lifestyle. Potok vividly presents both the joys and the frustrations associated with such religious culture. The story is beautifully told, the portrayal of Jewish culture fascinating and the issues discussed are challenging."
2,a great example of the struggle for zionism in the 1940's,"ok, the book may focus on the relationship between two young Jews, but the main theme they they are in conflict by, as their father show, is Israel. A state now, in 1948, on only when the Messiah comes and says so. BEIng Jewish and living in a traditional family that obseveres customs that both boys do, i fully understand the conflict and was fascinated by how well a person who knows nothing about Judiasm can learn so much. I had the honor to meet Chaim potok and he said he wrote it back in 1950 to show his support for zionism and how two people who are the same yet so different can cope together. They are both trying to keep the Promise. Read this and it's sequel. Both are simplely-written but powerful in meaning. DONT WAIT TILL YOU GET IT FOR YOUR READING LIST!"
2,He reads very slowly,"I like the guy's voice, but he reads slowly, and my students preferred to read aloud so they could ""get done."""
1,Ordered over a month ago and still haven't received it!!!,The person who I ordered this from took the money and never sent the product. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back!!! Never use them!!!
1,boring and waaaayyy too much detail,"like most people, i was forced to read the book for school...let me just say, if you have insomnia, i recommend this book...itll put u rite to sleep"
2,Good Entry HTPC case.,"The Antec NSK2400 case is a good entry level HTPC case. It is a nice size with a pretty nice finish. It is a quiet case that cools well. However the 380 power supply is a little low on the power end, especially if you are going to build a new system as of 2008. It is limited to an MicroATX mobo, which considering the size and ability to fit in a media cabinet is understandable."
2,extra hanging space where you need it,"This product is great for the laundry room, and I put one up in the master bath, it's great for laying out your close for the next day, or for hanging your close as you finish ironing them."
2,Great device,We did not have any place to hang my wife's dresses so they would not touch the floor in our laundry room. Installed this and solved the problem. When it is closed you never know it is there.
2,best idea,"Just wanted to say that my grandaughter is so taken with anything that Elmo does that at 18m she is so brilliant, LOL. she is enamored with Elmo so anytime we get something of his especially dvd's that she can watch, they are very affective. I am so greatful for these DVDs as is her mother!!!! He keeps her very interested in everything."
2,"Up Down, Near far","Great intro to the opposite theme, up/down, slow/fast, open/closed. My son loves it and says up/down whenever he hears someone say either word. Elmo is a great introducer of concepts."
1,Disappointing,"From the advertisement, we thought we were buying a lot of stickers. Nope. Just a few. It was very disappointing; the stickers are way overpriced for the quantity included."
1,Big disappointment,"The version that was released on DVD a couple of years ago is by far the best. This version is supposed to be ""restored""? My copy still has the scratches in the frames and skips every now and then. My biggest disappointment is that it does not include the reworked Raymond Burr version. Yes, I could have read that it didn't but I ASSUMED it did like the previous release did. For you purists out there it is a grand thing, but for me I wish I had of passed on this."
1,Misleading Title,"The description of the book ""illustrate them with 150 inspired examples"" is very misleading. The author talked about 150 riffs. You are supposed find the actual riff tabs somewhere else. After buying this book, you may need to buy another 100 books to find the 150 riffs the author discussed about. Skip this book."
2,Interesting and informative.,A well done presentation of the story of O author and here perspectives on the book. The quality of the film is also very good.
2,Excellent work by a master.,Although it's not as well known as some of his other work this is Pohl at his best! Take the worst trends of society right now and that's where this book starts. This is the sequel to Space Merchants and in some ways it's a redrafting of that story. Excellent.
2,Pretty Good,"My son really likes the ""Dave Series"". It's very informative and funny for my 4 year old. The only thing I didn't care for about this series is that Dave seems to get angry (in a funny way) a little too much. My son has commented about Dave hitting Becky."
1,High speed adventures,I bought 4 dvd's from the real wheels collection and was very disappointed. Lots of commentary and very little shots of things in action. Did not keep the attention of my preschooler--or the adults watching with him.
2,Robert Frost,For anyone who love Robert Frost poetry this book is an amazingly wonderful read. With each poem is an article telling about the circumstances when the poem was written. In this way more understanding of the poem evolves.
1,Grossly Outdated Material,"While this may have been a very good book in 1979, the, avian information gained over the last 20 years makes these older book obsolete, if not down right dangerous. These older books should remain out of print. I would recommend a more recent publication including periodicals such as ""Bird Talk"" magazine with up to the minute articles from today's (1999) experts. I've kept African Grey's for almost 10 years now."
2,A must have for the Godzilla collection...,"I am not sure what the fascination is with Godzilla but my son loves these monsters. This collection is good for the ""b-movies"" of Godzilla. I was not aware of the monster symbols noting the monsters contained in all the Godzilla dvds(but now I know). This is very good price for amount of Godzilla dvds you get. I would say that this is good quatity-wise rather quality. However my son loves it, so we will rate this with 4 stars...and I was told by him that it is a must-have for the Godzilla collectors :)"
2,Audio is underrated...,"I found this review to be clear, concise, and have lots of great information particularly useful on the exam. I wouldn't go so far as to say this should be your only resource, but as I was taking the Network+ I found myself remembering a lot of answers because I had read them, heard them, and spoken them. This audio review is very well produced, and the speaking parts are done very well. Also, this is a study resource that can be used while you are doing other things such as exercising, driving, or even sleeping at low volume. Credit to Coriolis for another fine product."
1,"Shallow coverage of servlets, may be of use for beginners","I flicked through this title in the bookshop, while looking for some good servlet titles. The coverage of this book is pretty shallow - for example their only mention of cookies is an API listing. Most servlet books cover cookies and session management, as well as more advanced (but related) servlet topics. I'd highly recommend ""Inside Servlets : Server-Side Programming for the Java Platform"" by Dustin R. Callaway instead."
2,100 Times Better Than Jason Hunter's book...,"This is a great book on Servlets. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book. It teaches you the basics and goes beyond the API docs.If you want a thorough walkthrough of the Java Servlet FAQ, then go grab the book by Jason Hunter :-)."
1,Who edited this thing?,"The book seems like a bomb someone dropped then ran. They leave no contact information for book updates, like they don't want you to find them. After reading through it and using some of the code samples, I found they were terribly written. I also found completely false information inside. They state, and I quote ""The POST method on the other hand, causes the data to be encrypted and sent in a seperate transmission"". - Which is completely false. If this is dead wrong, who knows what else in there is?? This guy gives servlets a bad name... where are the other servlet books?"
2,Absolutely terrific ! 1,"LOVED IT ! What a great story. Gabe and Kelsey are great together. Both strong and gentle. Suspenseful to the very end. This story has it all, passions that sizzles, suspense that hold you and characters that make to you love them or HATE them, there is no in between. Read it and try to put it down."
2,True Betrayals,"This book starts with a woman named Kelsey who is trying to get over her divorce, she gets a letter in the mail and finds out the mother who she thought was dead is really alive. She goes to Naomi's farm and finds out that her mother was in prison for killing a man. She decides to stay go and stay at the farm to get to know her mother, she meets a man and starts to date him. Various things start going wrong and old enemies start coming back. I liked this book; it was a quick entertaining read for me. It's a love story with a little bit of mystery thrown in. It's not just about a romance though it's the story of a woman who is finally learning who she really is. While the heroin meant to go and connect with her mother what she really does is find out how strong she is and what she is capable of. She learns that she can stand on her own two feet and a person's history is not always the way it looks on paper. This is a good book to read when you want to sit back and relax."
1,Old map,"This map is out dated and doesn't show many of the secondary roads. I lost this map the first day that I was in Belize, and never missed it. The free map from the department of tourism was just as helpful, if not as detailed."
2,Just what I needed,"Having recently bought a jeep, this book was just what the doctor ordered. It's loaded with well written reviews and recommendations for off road adventures all around southern California. I've already done a few of the trails from the book and the reviews and info were very accurate. If you're new to off-roading in southern California, this one is a must."
2,4-Wheel Drive Trails,"This book is very helpful to the novice or experienced off roader. It is very descriptive of trails, landmarks, and gives you a accurate mileage counter at needed intervals along the way. This book grades the trails into three classes, easy, for most high profile 2wd or 4wd vehicles, moderate, for 4wd vehicles with lower gearing and somewhat experienced drivers, and then there is difficult, for the experienced driver with specialized modifications like diff. lockers, suspension lift, recovery devices and the willingness to have some damage done to the body or drive train of your vehicle. I would highly recommend this book."
1,disappointing and overpriced,"This 14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable, but then i do not know how to play the castenets. Also irritating is the fact that its not worth 14.95! At 3 dollars, this would be a decent extremely general introduction to the dance,...its a total ripoff. The wait time is probably so that the printer can run off a copy on threr inkjet machine and send it out. (its a PAMPHLET!) ps yes i take flamenco classes, hoping this would be a good complement. And its not."
2,This book is a must read for anyone,"This book takes you from group homes to the mean streets of Harlem where Claude Brown tested fate and even some of societies taboos yet was able to pull himself up from the ghetto. He looks at child hood frineds that slipped through the cracks of society that became heroin addicts, pimps, players, pushers, and prostitutes. He shows exactly what life in the ghettos is all about the pain and the suffering. I've read this book three times and it gets better each time."
1,Avid true crime reader but;....,this book was the only book I have purchased in true crime that I could not get into. I would be lucky if I read 10 pages. I only wish I could have returned it!
2,Fun,"This is the best comic book game out there. The actors capture the characters perfectly. Especially Spider-Man. The graphics are great for Playstation. It's just a fun game to play. Oh, and for the people who are THPS fans, this game is run on the same engine."
1,Horrible Printing,The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes. It seems every word that should start with 'h' starts with 'b'. How can this occur in the age of spell-checkers? Chesterton deserves better. This printing is absolute garbage. The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.
1,Low Quality Edition Full of Errors,"This edition must have been created by scanning an older one, and then neglecting to proofread the results. It is full of typos, omitted words and wrong words, which makes it very hard to read. The typesetting is also of very low quality, which also makes it hard to read. Amazon should really pay a little attention to the books they accept for sale. It would be nice to be able to assume that a book you find on Amazon meets some minimum standard."
1,Good book ruined by an incompetent publisher,"This may have been a fine work in its original form, but this edition (Wilder Publications, 2008) is so shoddy, it isn't worth the effort to try to read it. Based on my own experience with OCR software, I would guess that this publisher scanned an old copy, translated it to text, then reformatted it, and printed it. There is no evidence that anyone proofread it prior to printing. It it doubtful that it was even run through a spell-check program. Periods are missing at the ends of sentences; words are left out; ""d"", ""h"", and ""b"" are confused; apostrophies are inserted randomly (probably fly-spots on the original), ""and"" repeatedly appears as ""an"", ""modern"" almost always appears as ""modem"", etc. ad infinitum.I read through about a fourth of the book before giving up in exasperation."
1,Disappointing,I was initially excited about this book.Hearing claims of wit and graceful apologetics. Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good. It seemed hard to follow and the points or arguments that were used were poor.They could've easily been refuted with other arguments that I didn't even agree with. I know that wasn't the main point of the book but honestly after reading it I'm not sure I know what that was anyway.
1,"Great book, terrible publishing","There's no question in my mind that Chesterton was one of the most brilliant thinkers and writers of the 20th century. He's amazingly insightful, searching out the big questions of existence with easy, witty prose.Unfortunately this particular edition of The Everlasting Man represents the worst commercial publishing I have ever seen. It is printed in tiny, poorly spaced text, with innumerable typos making nonsense of sentences and resulting in a very frustrating reading experience. Pay a little more for a decent edition!"
1,"Egregiously cheap, nasty, and overpriced edition of great book","This, the Wilder Publications edition of The Everlasting Man, is an egregiously cheap and nasty edition of a great book. It is printed on oversize pages with very narrow margins in an apparent effort to reduce printing costs to a minimum. Overall, the production quality is on a par with an instruction manual that might come with a no-name hair dryer or computer part from East Asia, or, actually my first thought was off-brand Dungeons & Dragons extension materials circa 1976. You will be much happier with the Ignatius Press edition for only $1.00 more, which is the one I would have gone for had it been easier to locate on Amazon. I plan to return this and get the Ignatius Press version instead, or possibly Volume 2 of the Collected Works."
1,Misleading book,"This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort. I'm not surprised its not in stock."
1,"It is NOT a starter kit, just a DVD!","What you are buying is just a dvd, not the starter kit that is shown on the costumer images... and the one I bought never started playing, not even once."
2,Previous reviewer reasonably unhappy,"I understand perhaps why the previous reveiwer was unhappy about this new book. Although I am relatively new to Kohl, this book is somewhat repetitious. It feels more like an overview of some of Kohl's work in schools, with some noticeable development of his critical ideas. Kohl details his ideas about stupidity in the current public school system (related to his idea of ""not-learning"" in ""I Won't Learn from You"") and he has some pretty strong words for special education programs and the flood of ADD/ADHD ""cases"" in our schools. It's a good book, definitely worth a read; however, if you know Kohl's work intimately, you might be happier borrowing it from the library instead of shelling out $20."
2,Blue Ray vs DVD,I own both the original DVD and the Blue Ray Disc of this movie. I have played them both and it is impossible to compare the two together. The Blue Ray Disc offers much more clarity and sound to that of the standard DVD. It was given to me as a present and I plan to gradually replace my standard DVD's - at least those I particularly want to see in Blue Ray - to get the most out of the movie experience.I highly recommend this product to those interested in an incredible Visual and Audio experience.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]
2,Off the Chain!,"I don't know why this film didn't get more attention? The authenticity is amazing,down to the actors wardrobe! Russell Crowe is Capt.Jack Aubrey, a hard nosed,sail with your gut Captain. Though he shows a tender side as well. This is a MUST see for action fans and Drama fans alike! Scrip is well wrote,storyline takes you on a trip through the unforgiving waters of the southern atlantic ocean, even to the Galapogos Islands! Again, a must see folks! Take it from a movie junkie,a person who can watch all the Star Wars movies and then watch Girl Interupted with the same attention!"
1,The longest plane trip ever,"Master and commander, well Russel was nominated for his acting, all the reviews said how good it was, I think they must have shown it at the morgue as it was DEAD boring.... I had a flight to take and great the movie was Master and Commander. So with great anticipation I sat down to enjoy this raved about movie. I have never known a 3 hour flight to last for 6 and a half hours, well that's how long it seemed to take for this movie to finish. I had to go to the WC half way through the movie, even without sound it looked boring. Down the back of the plane were the air crew, each with their own portable DVD players watching other movies.. I wonder why??? The most boring dead beat story to come to the big screen in the past 10 years..... Don't waste your money!!!!!!!"
2,An Excellent Naval War; Strategy and Action Movie...,"If you like war,naval sea,history and strategy movies, do not miss this one. Master and Commander will be your Number 1 movie for this category..Russel Crove is at his best along with Gladiator where he puts out the smart captain character smoothly along with the story. Have been watching this movie twice a month since I have bought it. Do not hesitate and add this item to your shopping cart and your collection, you will be happy for sure..."
2,Good movie,"This is a very good movie, with the exception scene of the character with the cannonball (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean). This movie features two great battle scenes and shows a decent ""slice of life"" for an English ship in the Napoleonic Wars and shows the cunning of two great captains as they chase and fight their way around South America.I hope that Russell Crowe and company make more of these since they come from a series of books. I'll watch them all.I recommend that the home viewer use the close captioning so that he or she can read all of the great lines used by the Englishmen used during the battle scenes. My favorite is used by one of the men in a rowboat who yells at the others, 'Pull! Pull like you're pulling a Frenchman off of your mother!'"
1,Defective DVD,"""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" is a great movie. However, I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable. When looking at the readable side of the DVD after the movie froze part way through chapter 13, I could clearly see the defective area. It looked as though someone had spilled a bit of acid on that part of the DVD.Amazon.com's website instructed me to go to the manufacturer for replacement of manufacturer defects.The manufacturer, 20th Centry Fox, provided me with return instructions and I shipped the DVD and information to them on Oct. 30th 2006. I paid for the return shipping, and presumable there will be no other charges to get the replacement DVD.It is now Nov. 11th and I am still waiting for my replacement DVD."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Wow! Am I ever happy I did not spend 10 bucks to see this in the theater. It is possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Granted, I am not particularly interested in this genre, but even my boyfriend, who was all hyped up to see this, was bored senseless."
1,Damaged DVD,This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it. It was returned and picked up on 1.4.10 and I have not yet received a credit for it. Please let me know how to proceed and receive my credit so I can purchse another DVD. I was very excited about viewing it and would still like the opty to do so. Thank you.
1,"A movie about blond hair, mostly","A British warship in the Pacific is taken by surprise and pounded hard by a bigger, faster, better designed and better armed French warship during the Napoleonic wars.Nevertheless, the British give chase and we kinda know they will prevail because they are ... blond.This is confirmed by the few scenes where you actually get to see some Frenchmen. They are shaggy, dirty, grim, and, unfortunately for them, not blond.So everything makes sense.Entertaining, mostly of you are blond and not French."
1,Beautiful But Boring,"England is at war with France. Russell Crowe plays a sea captain chasing after an American-made French ship. Not throughout the entire movie was I made to feel like I had to chase the ship too. I never felt the obsession on the level I was intended to. First it was a Moby Dick movie, then it was something else, then back to Moby Dick again. I took a break 1/3 of the way through to come back in to one of the crew jumping off the ship to commit suicide. I would have jumped too if I were in this movie.If you like cinematography, it was absolutely gorgeous. But you might want to wait to rent. There are far too many other good movies releasing this time of year to see instead."
2,"Good movie, better disc!","I didn't know what to expect, in fact, I actually expected this to be a long drawn out movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story that keeps your interest. Although the picture quality of this blu ray is excellent, the sound steals the show. Those with a capable speaker setup (especially the sub) will benefit the most. In the first scene it sounded and felt like the canon ball was going straight through my room. There are even times where it seems like things were gonna fall on my head. If you've never seen this movie, I would rent it first. If you have seen the movie, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this blu ray just for its demo worthy soundtrack."
2,"Top notch audio, video unimpressive and no extras","I really liked this movie in the theater and on dvd. Sound design and delivery is top notch on this blu-ray version. The video is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The video seems to lack the punch that I know blu-ray can deliver. Not much is offered in the extras department. Overall, I was expecting a little more than I received."
2,For God and Country,"The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts. The good guys(the English) are going to win. The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are ""killed"" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship. This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting. Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide."
1,Yuck,Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe. He did not really have a lot of lines to say. The movie was very boring in my opinion.
1,no go,"my husband got himself all set up for a peaceful aftenoon viewing, this was short lived as DVD announced could only be played in 'A' zone."
1,Expect nothing and you may not be disappointed,"I walked out of this film with nothing, no sense of exhilaration (like one gets with good action sequences), no warmth, as with a great story that you just learned about, there were some good visuals, and the audio was strong (you felt a chill from the rain and wind from THX) - but that was by far the highlight.I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film. I guess politics in Film reviewing is no different than any other politics - people will say what they need to when the perks / or $ is good enough. (Hell, if our President is doing it - why shouldn't a movie reviewer)."
1,most disappointing of any Crowe film...........,"The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.The dialogue was often drowned in it.....Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........If you think that this film is exciting, then you probably would love watching grass grow......."
1,waste of time......,"I wanted so bad to like this movie, but unfortunately I could not. This movie almost put me to sleep, oh it's true. I had a hard time understanding the dialog so I was forced to use the english subtitles. There's almost zero action in this movie and even the one battle scene was weak. Too much talking and playing violins.(hee haw!) Very, very boring movie. I'm sorry guys but this one sucks bad... Real Bad!....... Can you dig it?"
2,Good step by step guide,The book is spoton and easy to follow. However I need to use scripting for version 4.0b. Is there one available for that? Is there one coming out soon?
2,Outstanding,"This was my first O'Reilly book, and one I've used ever since as a yardstick of what they're capable of producing.Faced with the daunting task of writing a compiler, I discovered this book and was amazed at the wealth and depth of information it contains.It could possibly do with a little extra theoretical background, but if you are looking at any sort of task involving lex and yacc or their derivatives, buy this excellent book."
1,"ok, but there is a better LEX/YACC book","To keep it simple, the book ""Introduction to Compiler Construction in UNIX"" introduces and explains LEX/YACC far better than this book. It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail. This book is ok for a quick intro, but for a 'real"" user, refer to the book I mentioned above."
2,An Almost Adequate Dvd II,"The original Japanese theatrical release is remastered and looks pristine. However, this is not the case with the American English dubbed version. Classic Media should've reconsidered cleaning up the American version as one may want to watch it as an alternative to reading and concentrating on the subtitles.Included on the dvd are features that are welcomed by die hard fans of Godzilla but personally I would've wanted interviews with stars of the film-giving their insights on the movie, experience in filming scenes etc. It especially would've been a treat if they were able to get an exclusive interview with the peanuts.In short, this should be in any Godzilla collection especially for completists."
1,"Good movie, but the DVD presentation falls short...","Let it be known that I'm an avid Godzilla fan, and I wanted some DVDs for my new DVD player, so I bought this DVD. Boy, was I disappointed! There's really only 3 extras on the DVD--interactive menus with scene selection, a Destroy All Monsters Game Cube promo, and audio set-up options (english mono and 5.1 Surround sound). The 5.1 Surround sound echoes and sounds unbarable. Options to change the language to Japanese, and add/remove subtitles would've been nice, as I don't care for dubs. The picture's quality is really bad--there's scratches, and what not, making it seem like a bad video transfer. Still, the promo's pretty cool, the animated intro by Mothra's kinda neat. Overall, this DVD is worth picking up only if you can't get a hold of Simitar's superior version."
1,Wannabe Beatles,It seems that they have always tried to be like The Beatles in everyway of their career. They keep telling everyone they are greater than Jesus - the world only took note when The Beatles said it. This album is REALLY disappointing and shows the weak(est?) side of Oasis...great sound when snapped.
2,"Admitted Oasis fan says ""Go buy this CD!""","Okay, so I've always been an Oasis fan. So what? True, Definitely Mabye and What's the Story are their best CDs. So what?These guys are good and know how to make music. Some people hate the Beatles comparison, but I really do think it is appropriate. While maybe not as inventive as the Beatles, their harmonies, lyrics and music are outstanding. Their songs tend to grow on you with repeated listenings. Their CDs tend to be strong all the way through.This is an outstanding CD highlighted by some very good tracks. Fxxkin' in the Bushes (while I hate the title and ""lyrics"") is bold and bouncy. Go Let It Out, Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is and Gas Panic are all terrific songs. The rest are ""just"" good."
2,Classic Oasis is back,"This album to me far out weighs Be Here Now and to consider the kind of mainstream music out there now, with this album Rock N roll is hopefully back! Great songs on this album include the spiritual Who Feels Love? The timeless Gas Panic? and the sure to be Oasis classic Roll It Over! A special album indeed. Especially if your a fan of the Beatles White Album."
1,"Damn, this one was way too boring.","Ya thought What's the story was a stupid cd, think again. This cd takes the cake as the most stupid cd this year has released. I hate Oasis and it's arrogance. I hate every cd they've ever released. I'm glad I've only bought 2. Stay away!"
1,"Oh come, have some imagination people....","Oasis were never really the most talented or imaginative band, but they wrote good pop songs that made sense 5 years ago. But this? It's overblown, uninspired MOR rock. Why buy this imitation when you can buy the real thing, or, shock horror, something new and imaganitive (check out Primal Scream...)"
1,Where's Liam?,"I'm a big Oasis fan. I was one of those few people who actually thought ""Be Here Now"" was brilliant, but this stinks. Only ""Go Let it Out"" even sounds like Oasis, the rest of the stuff is downright odd, and usually bad. Liam isn't even on 3 of the 10 songs, and, unfortunately, those are 3 that actually show some promise. But, without Liam, they sound flat and lifeless. If you want to hear just how bad a song Oasis can make, just listen to ""Little James"" it must be some sort of inside joke, beacuse it is truly horrible. Buy the single, but leave the album alone."
2,Oasis is finally back!,"Oasis is probably one of my fave rock groups ever. I've been waiting for a long time for this album to come out since The Masterplan. SOTSOG is great! I think I got the explicit version (it has two red X's, not that sign). The songs are great. I don't understand why people don't like this disc. It's different than their other ones. They don't have that Beatles sound really anymore. Well, it's not as distinct. If you love Oasis as much as I do, go get it! You won't be disappointed!"
1,what a waist of time,"Who would have thought, that with such a ""great"" list of actors & actresses that this movie would be so bad. The scrip must have been written by a foul mouthed teenager as it had no depth and no direction & every other word was a swear word. Do people really talk like that? Not were I live and thank goodness. YUK"
1,Boring Movie,"What a disappointment this movie was. It had really good actors but it was slow, uninteresting, and just a waste of time."
1,Bad language alert,When a movie gives Jesus the F word as a middle name I can't watch it and it is all over for me.
1,Then she found me.,"Hard language was not expected! The F bomb is dropped including,""Jesus F'ing Christ."" This is unacceptable. Not for families. Otherwise it was fair."
1,helen hunt is like a piano with one key,"From the beginning of the movie, to about three-quarters of the way through, when I ejected it--I kept telling myself ""it's got to get better""--it never did. There wasn't a single character that ""grabbed me""--and at least two that finally caused me to push the eject button.Does Helen Hunt ever play a role where the audience isn't glaringly aware that it's Helen Hunt on the screen? She whines and chews her way through every line of dialogue until the hair on my arms stands on end. She never deviates: A Good Woman and Then She Found Me--these are very different movies--you'd think she'd do something different with the characters (to fit the time and the place in which the story takes place). I've made a pact with myself--no more movies with Ms. Hunt. This one was the last."
2,Kind of Slow but Good Story,"Watched this with my mom and four aunts. Totally a chick-flick. Good story, worth watching. Any movie with Colin Firth is! right?"
1,Bette Midler Saved This Movie From A One Star,"This movie started slow and an hour into it I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, by that time I felt I had so much time invested I may as well watch the rest. What torture. Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools. Then finally Bette walked in and saved the day, she didn't have any great script to rely on though. Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick don't have any chemistry and they're not believable as a couple so when things get rocky in their marriage you find yourself rooting for the break up. Helen's more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot. There's nothing interesting about this movie, not even the setting. I'm a huge Colin Firth and Bette Midler fan and their roles here are forgettable."
1,Where's the comedy?,The bright spot in this movie was Bette M. I don't understand how an actor of Firth's calibre could waste his talents by appearing in this drivel. To characterize this movie as a comedy is a total misleading fib. Nothing like the book!
1,utter tripe,"this book is down there with linux unleashed. It tries to cover every linux topic under the sun, while subtly missing everything useful about every topic.this book should be completely avoided at all costs. the authors (I can't imagine how it took two to write) have just gleaned information from the intros in every howto.get the howtos. if you want it in hardcopy, get a printer. or get the latest linux bible.actually, I would have given this book 0 stars if that was an option."
1,Imports are silly/don't buy it.,"Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, ""Heart Shape Glasses"" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date."
1,Awful,This book is horrible. Written as if the person reading it chews rubber-bands and drinks glue for entertainment. Avoid any class using this book. Would give .10 star if possible.
1,Hair: Its Power and Meaning....,"An awful atrocity of the literary genre. It was like the personal notebooks of various authors compiled into an uneven mess. Too many articles, too many footnotes & references to page numbers of other books, too little of pictures. Too many irrelevant points of view. I did not enjoy it. It's only a few hundred pages and is entirely black & white, and it was way to high-priced. Like $24.00. If you're looking for any meaning or pictures of the wonderful & elaborate hair dos of Asia, you will find no information in this horrible book."
1,Where's the heat?,"This one's going back to the store. It has been turned on for almost half an hour and I barely feel the heat. If you ask me, my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat. As for the ""massage"", it's worthless to me, but I am not one for vibrating massage anyway, I prefer shiatsu. I get cold feet when I am home and not moving around a lot, so I think I will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet!"
1,This Book Doesn't Deliver,"I bought this book after it was rated one of the top ten real estate books of the year in the Los Angeles Times real estate section. Boy, was I disappointed. This book didn't come close to living up to its promises. The author gave too much information and not enough direction for the typical layperson. He explains the reasons behind all the fees that are attached to loans, but does little to explain how to avoid or reduce them. He describes the different types of loans available, but doesn't really tell you why you should choose one over another. This book was a mostly a waste of time. You are better off reading the section about mortgages in Home Buying For Dummies and finding yourself a good mortgage broker."
1,Lacks detail in Backup & Recovery Section,"I used this book (Exam Cram - Test 3 & Test 4 for OCP) and the Jason Couchman (Oracle Press) DBA Exam Guide (the one that's over 1000 pages in length) to review recently for the Backup & Recovery Exam for the Oracle Certified Professional Track. This book's section on Backup and Recovery really wasn't adequate in my opinion to pass the test. It did provide a very good general overview, but one really needed the Couchman book to get the level of detail sufficient to answer some of the questions on the certification exam. I did pass, however, but do feel that this book alone would not have sufficed as the single resource to study for the exam. I cannot vouch for the Tuning section of the book (Exam 4 in the series), because I have not read that section at all."
2,EXCELLENT,Excellent at removing small scratches from auto finish without damaging the paint. I have used this for years and found nothing better.
1,bleah,"Schlock Rock, Cock Rock.....whatever you want to call it. I'm just glad those days and those types of bands are gone. Brad Gillis was a douch bag!"
1,Only good if you know the program,"This book is a good reference but not for those who are not proficient already in MAX. As others have stated, the examples often skip steps, assume knowledge of the workings of the program and show ""this is what you should end up with"" pictures that don't relate at all to what the instructions give. I get the impression also that each chapter was written by a different person because they cover material that has sometimes been discussed or later chapters cover basic material that was left out at the beginning. If you are beginner, don't buy this."
1,the pill splittter did not work at all well the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin),the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin). I am very disappointed in it. Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one?
2,"Boxes, Boxes and More Boxes, Oh My!","Mom's moving to another stated and needed a tape dispenser that would be hassle free allowing her to zip through taping up packages quickly. This worked. Every time we spoke over the tele, she raved about it."
2,Great Book,Easy to follow instructions. Every recipe I tried was a success. The lack of pictures is a minus. I strongly recommend it
1,Publisher's Dream,"It is fairly obvious that the publisher is going to milk this series for all its worth.There are indications that a number of writers/editors may be involved with writing for the series.Nothing at all wrong with this, if you enjoy the kind of pulp output developed in the 40's and 50's and carried through to this series.My Advice: Wait until you see the Blockbuster Promotion which says that this is the last one: finally the Last Battle will be fought and...have some sort of result, which will spawn the next series.And the publishers will enjoy your moneyShannon O'Hara"
1,A long series made seemingly endless with this book,"I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos, along with the preceding two books, suddenly began to drag. It's as if Robert Jordan only has 5 books worth of quality writing to put into this series but is under contract to put it into 10.I've been reading Chaos since it was released on paperback (who knows how long ago that has been) and I've yet to finish it. Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler."
2,Lord of Chaos,"This book is my personal favorite so far in the series. It had many pros and a little con. the pros were: the creating of the black tower. the healing nyneave can do. and the last chapter is very good. there is also much much more. the bad sides are there are still long talks between nyneave and elayne. The boring tugging of braids, smoothing of skirts, and icy stares.The last chapter,Dumai's Wells, is my favorite because of the battle there. Over all it was the best so far to my opinion."
2,The definitive exploration of fantasy writing in our time.,"Robert Jordan continues his complex tale of Rand , the Dragon Reborn, a man born to save the world and in doing so scorch it beyond recognition. In this book, Rand continues his struggle against waiting maddness and ever more determined foes, while the Dark One begins seeding the land with chaos. A must Read!!"
1,This book may just make me quit reading this whole series,"I can't believe the number of good reviews I've seen on this book. This volume advances the plot by so little, it could have been done in 100 pages or less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's getting sick and tired of the endless bantering, ranting and raving of the women in the book (especially Nynaeve). It seems like Mr. Jordan is determined to just make all of the female characters in the book look like fools (he's doing a great job so far). I had originally thought that this series was going to end at 8 books, but now I'm not so sure. It seems that Jordan is just going to drag this series out for as long as it takes. The writing is getting worse, the situations are getting less interesting, and it seems that he's writing to an audience of 12-year-old boys."
1,Never ending,"I acutally spoke to Robert Jordan at a book signing at the time this book came out. At that point I asked him:""how many books there were going to be in the series?"" 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.""about the plot - do you have it worked out?"" Making it up as I go.My heart sank when I got these answers and it probably explains why the series has got so bad from this point onwards. I stopped reading this series when I heard these answers, because I knew it wasn't going to end up well plotted out and was just drifting on and on.This may explain a few mysteries as to why this series has declined in quality so badly. He's got 2 stars because the books were still readable at this time - but there was/is no end in sight still."
1,"Great book, wrong Cover","This is a great book (5 star content), however, the kindle edition does not have the new redesigned cover (reason for 1 star rating). I really hope this gets fixed soon. The new covers are the only reason I am purchasing these books on the kindle. All the other WOT books I have purchased for the Kindle have the nice redesigned cover. If you want to know what the cover should look like (from the Tor Website): [...]"
1,Yawn....,"....when I had trouble sleeping at night...all I had to do was pick this book up and I'd be passed out within 15 minutes. I've read the first six books of this series, and this one by far, was the most difficult to get into and finish. The only character who seemed to grow and mature was Egwene. Perhaps it is time for me to go to another author/series...any suggestions?"
2,I don't understand people,"I really don't understand the mindset that would say this isn't a good book. It was spellbinding. There is character development. You care whether most of the characters live or die. There is ample development of the storyline and you feel a move to the end of the series especially with the massive developments of the end. It may not be great literature (but then it may be), but it is a fun read that doesn't seem nearly as long as it is."
2,Excellent purchase!,"I was not willing to spend the $700 for Toyota to put the towing kit on my vehicle so I picked up the Hopkins adapter and a towing kit off ebay for under $200. Installed all in under an hour, works well with my camper!"
2,"Great Product, Great Customer Service!","I purchased this adapter (47185) at Walmart. It is ruggedly consructed and easy to install and works great. The real reason for my review is to commend the customer service at Hopkins Mfg. Some how I misplaced the mounting bracket that came with the adapter when I was working on the wiring and drilling mounting holes. I called Hopkins to buy another bracket... they said they will send me one for free, and 36 hours later it was at my door! Thanks Hopkins."
2,"""Dave"" video series","My son LOVES all these videos! I think the guy ""Dave"" is a little corny but he does do an amazing job showing kids all the trucks, etc. Very recommended- my daughter watches them also."
1,This book is complicate and ugly,"This book starts with ""What is PL/SQL?"". But through the following 900 pages, I could not find a simple example showing how to test run a simple PL/SQL code or procedure through Oracle sqlplus or other Oracle calling interface, such as OCI and Proc. Well, my rating above might be biased. I made a career change from physics to become a professional C/C++ programmer by reading K&R's C Programming Language to begin with. However, I do not feel reading this book alone can get me anywhere but waste all my time. If five stars for K&R's, one star is all for this book. It's a matter of Simple and Beautiful vs Complicate and Ugly."
1,Not a reference book,This book is useless as reference it doesnt fully describe basic functions like to_number. author waste pages on style which is useless to experienced programmers. waste of money
2,"God's love, it's an awesome thing","Wow, what a wonderful book. Kendra has put into words, what love is and how love works. Not only does she allow us to learn about wordly love, but she has given us the advantage of knowing about the greatest love of all, God's love. If you have no idea has to how God's love works, this is the book for you."
1,Not quite the Originals,"Beware, these songs sound a bit remixed, and are not the original sounding radio hit singles. Usually .89 cent songs are a red-flag."
1,Don't bother ordering these,"The listing picture is not representative of the product. It is made out of hard plastic, and it is thick. The result is that it extends into the wheel well by about an inch!Because of the photo, I was expecting something that fits tight against the back of the wheel well and wraps around the body a little bit. I was surprised to see that this mounts against the back of the well but extends so far into the wheel well."
1,Bought for Mercedes,I thought these looked like decent rock guards. I'll probably give these away if anyone will even take them. I'll be buying something off the self from a department or auto parts store for less money that will be more durable.
2,Ray Ban Sunglasses,"I absolutely love these sunglasses. These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake. The originals were actually a little too big. This is why I lost them. Ordering through Amazon, I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price. Can't beat that!"
1,Confused look at ATL,"While I respect the authors as programmers since this book does contain some valuable information, they have no business writing books. This book spends all of its effort discussing how COM works and then how ATL was implemented and provides little insight on how to actually use ATL. After reading this book I was very discouraged from using ATL. Few things are adequately explained. I wonder who the target audience for this book is? It is certainly not ActiveX developers. The second half of the book is superior to the first half. Inside COM, by Rogerson, puts Inside ATL to shame."
1,There are better books than this,"I was looking forward to this book for several months. It was supposed to be released originally Oct. '98, but the release date kept getting later and later. I really thought once it did come out it would be a good book. Boy was I wrong. I would recommend trying a different book if you want to learn or use ATL."
2,"We love it, however, . . .","We truly love the Canon PIXMA mini260 Photo Printer. The quality of the photos is sharper, clearer and has brighter color than those we saw that were printed on the HP 712 photo printer.However, it would be very nice if the Canon PIXMA had 2 to 4 Gig of internal memory. Also it does not directly receive our Olypus XD photo flash card. This means buying an adapter to insert the card into in order to feed photos directly into the printer or downloading the files from the card onto the computer hard drive and then into the printer. It is not a problem as long as you have any flash card other than the XD.The adapters are a little hard to find locally. They'er avaliable on the net.All in all - the quality of the photos makes up for the file download hassle."
2,Simple - It's good to be me!,The one who loves Gene Simmons or Kiss will love this - Gene is crazy - but perfect and this is why we love these DVDs. We bought the 1st two packages so it was clear to us - to also buy No. 3. In germany you are not able to buy these packages and in TV you will always get a translated version - that's boring.
1,Another fake reality show,"This show is entertaining, but it annoys me that a show that is meant to be a reality show is fake. I didn't know how fake it was until I watched the episode ""Gene Down Under"". The entire episode involving Gene buying a football team is fake, none of that happened in real life.I wish this show was more reality than ""scripted reality""."
1,One of the least useful I've encountered!,"I find this set to be next to useless. The Italian on it is so very basic that it's an insult to anyone who has already made any effort at all to learn the language. For all its faults, I find the Michel Thomas set much more helpful - ditto for the Berlitz Intermediate Italian. I concur that the CD's have (even as ""brand new"" ones) places where the skipping / data flaws are terrible and there is too much dead air on them. Don't waste your money. There are better courses that don't insult your intelligence, and that also use Native speakers (if this is important to you)."
1,ELP Goes POP - Lets Us All Down.,"I am a lifelong fan of ELP. My favorites are WORKS and Trilogy and the Self-Titled CD but overall, I believe there is something awesome in every ELP album. Except this one. This was the only ELP CD that I did not yet own because I was scared to buy it. Now that I have purchased it I am at a loss for words.This is not the ELP that I remember. This is an attrocity. So I did some reading up on the subject and I found out that this album was basically belched out in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. Don't expect any of the same energy you're used to from ELP. Clearly, their hearts are not in it with this one. It has a rushed feel and there is nothing impressive here.I am sorry. I really wanted to give a better review than that because they are my all time favorite band. But I cannot.-(V)az"
1,C++? I don't think so!,"The caption on the front of this book says: ""Provides a concise, comprehensive guide to the ways ADO 2.0 can be used in all kinds of applications. Demonstrates ADO using VB, C++, J++ and scripting languages with ASP.""I have no issue with the first sentence. The second sentence, however, is a blatant lie. I think Wrox should be ashamed of themselves. There are a combined total of less than a page of things referencing C++ in here. If you're going to claim something, maybe you should make sure you actually deliver. This is pathetic.I, for one, am not planning on buying any more Wrox books in the future.Tom McKearney tmckearn@hotmail.com"
2,Very good book,I truly enjoyed the book. Very interesting story line and very thought provoking. Well written and I couldn't put it down.
1,too far fetched,Find something else to read. This is not believable. I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle.
2,LOVED IT TO THE END...,"This is my third Picoult novel and I have the fourth ready to start. I was riveted by this book and stayed up until 6:00 a.m. 2 nights in a row to get it finished. I LOVED it until the final paragraph. Then she lost me. I still give it 4 stars because she's an awesome writer, but I just didn't ""get"" the final scene. Maybe I'm dense, but I have mulled it over all day and still can't figure out what it all means in the end. Oh, well...I recomend Picoult anyway. After reading The Pact and Handle With Care, I ordered Keeping Faith and Nineteen Minutes and will probably read her entire collection. She is a wonderful writer and I'm happy to live in New Hampshire because I recognize a lot of the places she writes about!"
2,"God, in a new light","Jodi Picoult's book ""Keeping Faith"" made me think about my own religious beleifs in a new light. It also taught me some things about different faiths that I didn't know. The amount of research that goes into her books is amazing. I highly recommand any book writen by this author."
2,Keeping Faith,Jodi Piccoult is the most amazing author! Her in depth research and portrayal of controversial subjects is astounding. Every one of her books seems as if she's telling her own story. Great read!
2,Keeping Faith,"I love this book, well written and kept me reading till the very end. Totally recommend it!!!"
2,Excellent book!!,"Fabulous book really made me think a bit different than other books by Ms. Picoult, but just as captivating! Highly recommend!"
2,so wonderful,"wonderful writing, intriguing characters, and a unique story line that is pleasantly unpredictable. this was another stellar book by picoult."
2,always enjoy her books,Jodi's books are predictable (drama + court case) but I always enjoy her writing and find I always learn something new.
2,a nice surprise!,"I have been reading Jodi's books wayyyyy before she became so mainstream. I never bought this book though because the topic seemed really iffy to me. I just didn't see how she could pull off this topic and make it into a good book. After getting her newsletter though and seeing one of the characters would be in her new book, Change of Heart, I decided it was time to read it. I must say I'm so happy I did. As a Catholic I found it especially interesting. Don't let the topic fool you though like it did me. There is a lot of religion but underneath that is a great plot and story line. Really enjoyable!"
2,Keeping Faith,"This is an unusual book, but it sure keep your attention. This story kept my attention throughout the entire book."
2,keeping faith,An easy read with a good story line...keeps you guess til the end! If you a Jody Picoult fan you will enjoy this 1
1,Not a page turner,"I had to read this book for a book club and that is the only reason why I finished reading it. It dragged on and on and on- a lot of fluff with religion thrown in. I can see how someone could see the ""deeper message,"" but the book was boring. And for 400 pages, it is almost a waste of time. Maybe if the book was half the size I would have somewhat enjoyed it and given it 3.5 stars."
1,You have to like the heroine and I didn't,"My title is basically my review. I didn't like Charlene. There are strong women and then there are self absorbed whiny people, Charlene fits the latter. Why the author describes Dennis as being loyal and wonderful is beyond me. He didn't have the gumption to break off his ""engagement"" before he starts an affair with the wedding coordinator. Charlene needs some snappy dialog and some female friends to get her on the right track but then that would be a Jennifer Crusie novel.....the premise for this book showed promise it just wasn't well executed."
2,Great Book for Learning about TCP/IP !,"I found TCP/IP JumpStart very helpful on a topic that is new to me. Computer networking field is a new topic that adds dimension to my portfolio. Andrew Blank has a wonderful way of teaching so a novice can understand yet an intermediate doesn't get bored. He brings examples and illustrations to the text enabling you to understand or actually visualize the technology concept. TCP/IP JumpStart brings technology into terms for beginners, also more advanced students can collect new ideas and concepts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is about to take a class or would like to learn about TCP/IP. This is a book that I can highly recommend to anyone."
2,A collection of one of the best comedies ever,This collection of all 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers is great! It is a nicely packaged 3-disc set and the episodes are all classic and gut-bustingly hilarious. I highly recommend purchasing this complete set.
1,"Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series, DVD","The Fawlty Towers episodes are hilarious and deserve their growing cult status. However, this DVD set is poor quality and not recommended. The problem is the compression used in order to fit the series on three DVDs: the frame-rate has been significantly reduced. This would be mostly unnoticeable on a slow moving film, but there is considerable amounts of fast movement in Fawlty Towers, so the result is a very distracting, jerky effect where actors magically jump from one position to the next. There is also a graining quality to the image that suggests other types of compression. What's the point of a DVD when the VHS delivers better viewing?"
2,Classic Cleese,It's such a shame only 12 episodes were made...This is great English comedy... in fact great universal comedy..I loved it... John Cleese is a Genius.
2,Laughter is the best medicine,"My wife and I watch Fawlty Towers on Saturday nights as a relief from the negative media barrage. The episodes have never let us down, and we hee-haw all evening. We love to watch them over and over. Great movies, those British sit-coms."
1,overRated!,"I'm sorry, but Fawlty Towers was at best a mindless sitcom. Characterization, plot, and even setting were a bare minimun as Cleese mugged his way to cheap laughs. It's funny for about three minutes and after that the same joke over and over just gets tired."
2,Fawlty not Farty,I love BBC comedy & this was a great addition to my collection - FUNNY! I can just play it for great background slapstick when I'm piddling around the house even...
2,BUY THIS TODAY!!,"I'm a stickler when it comes to comedy-especially tv comedy. When I saw this series back in the 70's I laughed very hard. Now that it's on DVD complete with all 12 episodes, I put the discs in, kicked back and laughed even harder. It didn't help that I had a slight cold-I could barely breathe and my ribs started hurting after watching the first disc. I then proceeded to watch the other two discs. I was in bad shape by the time I was finished but I didn't care. These old episodes are hilarious. This is the way tv comedy should be!!"
2,A must have.,Although dated sets detract somewhat the overall effect is splendid. A must have in any collection.
1,dissapointing!,"only good song was lyla and even that was no good, im onna pre order the new offspring album instead!"
2,Oasis rockin'!,"This album many not blow you away on the first listen, but it could easily grow on you! It's definitely better than Heathen Chemistry, and may be the band's best album since Morning Glory! It sounds slightly different from any other Oasis albums, but it's still something that Oasis fans should appreciate. If you hate Oasis, then you won't like this album, but if you're an Oasis fan, then I definitely recommend this album for you!"
2,Oasis are generally good.,"Really, it is hard to go wrong with an Oasis record. They always have some good lyrics hovering over some good rock music. To me, none of their albums, with maybe the exception of ""What's the Story"" are really totally great and timeless, but overall, it is good rock music."
1,"Waste of paper. waste of plastic, and a waste of paper.","Thankyou Oasis but no thankyou, your time is well and trully up, at the moment anyway.Your album don't ""Beleive the nonsensical lies and dishonesty towards all who like good music and are fans of Oasis"" is a dissapointment worthy of rating in itself, funnily enough it gets nice well rounded one star.The album has ""NO"" direction and ""NO"" purpose, sounding more or less, no more like Oasis take on 1960s rock n roll, which of course has been, been and down and has its place in time, but now I think its time to move on and do something new thankyou very much and givin the ""DISGUSTING"" state of new and older bands at the moment (beleive it or not) it was up to you to shine the light. That ended after your great album ""Heathen Chemistry"" so thankyou but no thankyou."
1,Modern Oasis is Rubbish,"The one star is for Liam's hair on the inside cover. At least that still has it's dignity.As for the music, I believe they have finally lost their touch.The Importance of Being Idle, Part of the Queue, and Let There Be Love are mediocre. Unfortunately, all of the other tracks are completely unlistenable.It's sad that a band who was once so great are putting out this kind of trash, but luckily for their fans, they let us down slowly with Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants and Heathen Chemistry - so at least it didn't come as a big surprise."
2,Love it even more!!!!,"Again, i just marvel in the risks these men and women take every time they get in a big rig! I love to watch the drama they face every day. It is very entertaining as well! I hope they come out with more and more episodes every year! I will look forward to seeing them every weekend!"
1,Could be so much better,"Housing is made very well, has a nice weight to it, but that does not apply to the base of the button which is made of plastic. If installed on an uneven surface or flashing that bends, the notch and a tab on the base do not snap together as they should. A redesign of the unit that eliminated the troublesome base would make this a very nice doorbell button."
1,Died... On a self-destruct logic board,"Until the logic board went and self-destructed, it was doing well. I am very upset with Canon and its short-lived circuitry."
1,Refurbished but not tested?,"I received the printer with a broken ink cartridge in the box, that should have been the first clue. Printer would not get past the set up returning an error about the ""scan lock"". Makes me wonder if they actually tested the printer before sending it back out again. If it hadn't been for the easy return policy I would have been very upset. Ended up buying a brand new Canon MP610 and had it up and running in a few minutes, very happy with it."
1,"Digital ""remastering"" is horrible","This CD does not do Mr. Rifkin justice at all. It sounds like a cheap ""MIDI"" version of Rikin's playing - like a cheap $50 electric keyboard. Gone are the acoustic sound that can be heard on the concert grand that Rifkin's original recordings are played on. You're better off buying the ""UN-mastered"" original CD from Nonesuch Records. This is an insult to one of the greatest Joplin interpreters."
1,Not worth the money,"Don't publishers proof read these books anymore? Numerous mistakes throughout the book including in the review questions. This book also does not cover things on the exam such as Compatibility settings. It seems as though the author just took the exam topics and wrote something that he thought was important, but not what Microsoft tested. Interestingly, one of the appendices contained test strategies that MS uses on the exams. Unfortunately the questions asked in the review exercises for the most part did not follow these guidelines."
1,Not a well written book,Book is one of the most boring I have ever tried to read. I read many travel books but this one is awful.
2,Cassette? This is 2010. Where's the CD Version,"I just want to say that this is my favorite book of all time. The writing of William Least-Heat Moon is filled with wonder. I give it a 10 out of 10!!!However this is 2010 and I still find it strange that Audiobooks; for the most part are only available on Cassette. Heck, I don't even own a cassette machine anymore. I wish the companies would start putting these out on CD.Steinbeck's Travels with Charley is available on CD. My second favorite book.Again the book is one that HAS to be in your collection. I have probably read it over a dozen times and I always find something new.CD version please."
2,Wonderful for the whole family,"Little Britches is a fantastic book. It takes the reader back to early 1900 Colorado and a family who loved each other and worked very hard as they struggle to build their ranch. This is the first book in a series and once you start reading you won't want to stop. Ralph (Little Britches) learns a lot of life's lessons the hard way. His father's parenting skills gently lead Ralph to make the right choices. There are horses, cowboys, and a water rights fued that provide excitement as well as many warm family moments."
2,Pretty good reading,"The writing style was simple; The storyline was engaging, the characters captivating. The story was narrated unsentimentally, but effects sympathy.However, this book contains profanity, besides mild violence and unwarranted reference to bodily function."
1,Absolute trash ...,I bought the first edition of this book - which was about 700 pages;It cost me $44.95 - and the book was not worth a penny! I believe the 2nd edition is better - because it has some extra pages and these last few pages are supposed to be better! I find that hard to believe ... The authors do not know how to write a technical book - they are belligerent! The book wanders all over the place - no details at all - or none of any consequence! If the publishers had any conscience they would send me the last section of the new edition FOR FREE! This was one of the worst computer books that I have ever run across ... AVOID other books by these authors!
1,Heavy Paperweight,"This book starts strong, then becomes a sad use of dead trees. There are a number of good examples on the uses of XML, but many overlap and become repetitive. The previous comment on poor editing is well founded...the number of blantant printing and typographical errors is astounding."
1,Where is the real content?,"I purchased this book on the strength that it was written by the creater of SGML so I figured 'how bad can it be?' Well I found out exactly how bad. This book fails to explain anything thouroughly, and whilst the first few chapters are fairly light and humourous, the middle section descends into needless and unjustified haranging of other fine technologies such as CORBA and seems to be one big advert for Microsoft and associates. Some of the information is just plain wrong, whilst other parts simply are badly explained. If your company is starting to try to avoid microsoft products as ours is, STAY AWAY! Boy I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book from a bookshelf in a store. I could have saved myself alot of time and money."
1,WORST book I have come across in a LONG time....,"This is a seriously awful book. It is without doubt the ugliest most badly designed book I have ever seen. Much worse it is badly written, sheds little light on the subject matter, and even more heinous, it is purports to be unbiased technical book, but mostly consists of blatantly biased chapters ""sponsored"" by Microsoft and others. I have just finished Chapter 6, ""sponsored"" by Microsoft and you would swear that IE was the only browser in the world, their implementation of DHTML the only one in the world, and there were no scripting languages/methodologies but VBScript and ASP. The writer did not have the PROFESSIONAL DECENCY to give a balanced overview of the subject matter, just tried to push MS products. SHAME SHAME SHAME on everyone involved in this terrible book. I am only giving it one star because the form won't accept anything less."
1,Where are the examples?????,"For the money I shelled out for this book, I expected to be able to see some fairly decent examples of how to 1. Write the XML code and 2. Use what I've written. Admittedly, I did skim through the book, but I figured, ""Hey, it's the guy who wrote the SGML spec - can't be too bad, must've just missed something. I'll catch it when I read the book.""Well, I haven't found it yet... still looking...nope, not there.I am very disappointed...And what the heck is a ""chapter sponsor"" or a book sponsor, anyway? If you've got sponsors, I should be able to get the book a wholoe lot cheaper.What a waste of money."
1,Useless,"An absolutely useless source for information on xml. The examples were not clear or useful, and the writing was too pretentious to read. I would not recommend this book, or any of the others in this series (i have read the others also- searching for something applicable)."
1,Advertising in a tech book?,"One of the strangest books I have seen and a very disturbing trend. The authors sold corporate sponsorship of chapters and let each company write an chapter-length ad. Its bad enough to get ads at movie theaters and on rental videos, but in a technical book? It's one thing to have ads in things where the cost is largely underwritten by the ads (like magazines), but its quite another to find 25% of a full-priced book filled with ads. Buying this book will only help to standardize this practice. Send the publishing industry a message by refusing to buy this book.As many other readers point out, this book is aimed at managers who could buy the products sold by the companies who bought chapter ads."
2,Excellent book! Well written and full of great information.,"This book is an excellent choice for learning about XML and the technologies (both new and old) that are utilizing or planning on utilizing XML. This book has something for everyone in the XML world, both novices and experts."
2,Great XML Overview,"Just wanted to say that this is a great book especially if you like ""real"" XML implementation examples. If you want an overview of what XML can do for you go get this book."
2,Good transaction,"Product arrived quickly, in perfect condition and was exactly as described. No problems with vendor. Very happy with product and transaction."
2,Abduction to the Ninth Planet,"I am blown away by this book, and what the author describes he was shown during his trip. His account confirms living in lower gravity, in harmony and love, the way of living, all serving one intention without monetary system, the dwelling places, Earth politics compared to true governing, the history of our planet, so much of what many of us have seen ourselves. The loving light energy he describes is very real. I bless and thank Michel for publishing his report. Read it, you will love it, it will open your eyes!"
1,Doesn't work with itouch,"no wonder it was only [...] bucks, now that I look closer I see the ipod touch isn't supported, but wtf, it says it ""works will all 'docking ipods'""I have an ipod touch, it docks, but apparently that's not a ""docking ipod.""Total waste of money! =/"
2,SPITTING NEARLY,"I,D LISTNING AND READING ABOUT SNCE 1976,BUT UNDERSTANDING ALOT I THINK THE FUNNY PARTS ARE THE BEST,BUT AS WE SAY HERE IN N-NORWAY :IF WE DIDNT`HAVE THE HUMOR WHAT DO WE HAVA???"
2,Enjoyable BUT....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book but, if you are looking for details and insight from ""the man himself"" re: Frank Zappa's extensive body of recorded works, then you will be sorely dissapointed.The first chunk of the book is mostly about his childhood and the last half or so is devoted to barbed essays on a miscellany of dis-jointed topics such as politics, raising a family, inventions that Zappa couldn't get funded, etc. In the middle you get a smattering of chronology describing the formation and first few years run of the original Mothers of Invention... Zappa's musical exploits through the 70's and 80's is nearly completely ignored!!, ...Instead of devoting numerous pages to tedious diatribes concerning the PMRC Music Labelling initiative, (which now seems like a historical ""non-issue""), I would have far preferred to have read an album-by-album review by Zappa offering insight into each of the tracks and any related anecdotes behind their creation."
1,Coming out story made by straight people,"At first I was gonna give it 3 stars. But after I had read some other reviews (I didn't have a chance to watch additional comments on dvd), I stopped at 2.WHy?Here's why:- Coming out story is the base of the plot, innit? Instead of making the relation between Riley and Andy more real, we are treated with scenes full of naked boobs, naked women)...- There is no chemistry between those two gays. P. Jones remains straight during the whole film.- The coming out moment is so fake. Slides? Who came with such lame idea in plot?- Instead of fighting with stereotypes, this film confirms 'em.- Some of the scenes are way too long or out of place- The type of jokes used in the plot is quite simple (farts? playing with dirty language? maybe good for teen comedy, but not for ""mature"" film)Good coming out story? ""BREAKFAST WITH SCOTT"", ""BALLS"".""Outing Riley"" it just a poor story made by straight guys who thought they were funny...Shame."
2,"Great story, well told","After watching this movie for the second time, I was able to look at it a little more objectively. It was definitely better the second time. It tells the universal story of family and love and acceptance from a gay perspective. That what we're all looking for, isn't it - acceptance? Lots of humor, likeable characters, and realistic relationships made this movie work for me."
1,Worth the price and not a penny more,"I paid a ridiculously small amount for this pair of shoes - under $20. With how little I paid for them, they are fine. I would not recommend then at full price. They are not worth $69. There is no discernible arch support, the soles are not padded, and the sides are not supportive."
2,Triumph's Most Consistent,"I thought this one was gonna suck and I only bought it because I'm OCD and a completist. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this album is. All of Triumph's other albums (except for their first) suffer from some serious filler, but every song was pretty decent on this one. Rik Emmett is gone, but Phil X does an excellent job on guitar and Gil Moore seemed to have stepped up his vocal performance. And as always with Triumph, awesome production."
1,Complete waste of money!!!,I bought this book based on the review I read in InfoWorld. I will have to say that this book provides little more than your IDE's online help. About the only thing this book is good for is kindling for my wood burning stove.
2,R & B Season 5,"There are a lot of excellent reviews of this set, to which I cannot add anything better. Rocky and Bullwinkle, along with Bob Clampett's Beanie & Cecil, taught me humor when I was young. Puns, non sequiturs - you name it - it's all here, and done without the potty humor that seems so prevalent today. Thank goodness we are able to enjoy these episodes again today!"
2,good reference book,this book of maps would probably be awelcome addition for an experiencedastronomer.....not for a beginningfan of astronomy. Nightwatch wouldbe my recommendation to the later.
1,don't buy the kindle edition,"i got the kindle edition and returned it the next day, the offset tables are small and cannot be enlarged so you can actually read them. so save yourself the trouble and get the printed edition. other than that, from what i looked over, it looks like the book has great information in it."
2,Winter boot,"Love the boots. Very warm and thick. The boots are ""heavy"" but it's just want you need in real bad snowy conditions that require good treads. They also fit very snug - but soft & comfortable with the interior padding."
2,Beats of the heart,"Amazing music. exellent explanations, not too long just in time.The singing , the druming , the words remind us where the real beating of the heart is coming from."
1,You get what you pay for,"It is unfortunate that Guy De M is known in the USA for his short stories. They are well-written and were ground-breaking 150 years ago, but they do not age well. This translation is particularly poor and the Dover edition is so cheap and flimsy that the only thing good you can say about it is that it's cheap. And cheap isn't always the best value. For great French short fiction, try Emile Zola. De M's novels are great and age much better than this stuff. Historically they're interesting but have an O. Henry quality that doesn't work much anymore."
2,Cool Watch,"Honestly, I have no idea what the buttons or dials do, but this watch looks cool AND tells time. I bought it because it looked alien, but I get compliments on it almost daily. It's big, and showing and gets the right kind of attention."
1,SHM CD version of Trilogy,"This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive, Japanese SHM CD version of Trilogy. Look for another version of this c.d.. The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that ""you won't believe it's the same c.d."". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a 10 star title that deserves better."
1,"Not thorough, nor helpful","This books is not as helpful as I expected at all. The structure looks very good, but when I read it, I found none of the topic was explained clearly and thoroughly. For example, adding a user, it only mentioned command adduser without indicating which file that really recorded the user information. Actually, when I installed Linux and set up configuration, I have to look for other help, like Linux online help. This book just added my confusion."
2,WOW!!!!,Que has done it again!! The leader in advanced computer books bring one of the best books for beginning Linux system operators
1,Recipes lack imagination,Nothing different about recipes. I was looking for something that had some other options or ways to use my pressure cooker
2,Cookers for Dummies,"I purchased this book with my new pressure cooker. It has some wonderful tips. It gives you an idea of how long to cook beans, soups etc... also shows you how to use your own recipes with a pressure cooker. The practical workings of a pressure cooker are explained to you and that was very helpful as I had never used one before. My experience has been that not all the timings are correct, at least for my altitude. For example if I cook the beans as long as the book says my beans are mushy. But it was a good start and I've learned how to adjust the timing. Over all the book was very helpful."
1,For smart dummies,"The book didn't answer a lot of basic questions for me, having never used a pressure cooker. It's O.K. as a supplement to other pressure cooker cookbooks, but I was hoping it would provide more step by step instructions.Very disappointing."
1,Not as good smelling as I thought.,Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.
1,Good for insomnia,"Though some of the material is useful, I found these tapes to be long and boring. The authors read the text like a funeral procession. I would much rather recommend any of Anthony Robbins work - which always has some NLP, presented in a passionate, immediately useful way."
1,waste of money,"i needed some comments on the linux ip code, the title was right and there was a five stars review by a reader, had no time to wait and so i ordered it by e-commerce. Already accustomed to comments a la R.Stevens was very hopeful What a mistake ! more than 450 pages of linux kernel listings, not only, the listed kernel was 2.0 (at this time the firsts 2.4 are out) !!!! The commentary, all at the end of the listing not very insightful, will never buy another book in this series !"
1,It didn't do Lord Soth justice!,"The book, Lord Soth, I found to be poorly written and failed to explain and give good reason for Lord Soth's spiral downward into the depths of evil. The way the book was written failed to show the emotions of Soth as he committed his crimes. The author seemed to just skim over the important parts, such as the deaths of Lady Korinne, Isolde, and his two children. Even though any DragonLance novice knows the tale of Soth, this book failed in showing Soth's honour and true evil. Also the summary on the back of the book concerning Soth's quest given to him by Paladine is quite misleading since it lasts a whole chapter at the end of the book. The novel also didn't fully explain what evil magic transformed Soth and his loyal knights into Death Knights. Overall I found the book very uninspired and was disappointed by it. Weis and/or Hickman should have written the book as opposed to some novice."
2,Review of Village Centenary,"Miss Read books are lovely stories of the everyday life of a village schoolteacher. They are wholesome, funny and light reading. This particuluar story chronicles a school year where the school is celebrating its 100th anniversary. The banter between Miss Read and her school cleaner Mrs. Pringle is wonderfully funny. I love Jan Karon and the Mitford series, these books are as delightful as a visit to Mitford."
2,Good Start for beginers,"This is a good start for somebody who never build a PC before, and give you and idea on where to start and what to do. This is a typical ""Hows to..."" book and I'll recomended it.Michael Da CruzCalifornia"
1,out of date,It's a good book but is a few years old so the material is dated. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Cyclone Featuring the sexy Heather Thomas,"here's a Movie from the past.i remember watching this way back in the days.i got it on dvd, and yea the movie is okay, but heather thomas looks great in the movie."
2,In ol' Virginia,"Basically a plotless book that contains a series of sketches depicting life on a Virginia plantation circa 1830. The main sketch involves a lawsuit over disputed land, which leads to comedy and romance. Kennedy is a skillful writer and offers up a charming picture of what life was like then. His style is light and fanciful, and one reads the book with a relaxed pleasure."
2,Great first watch,"Great first watch if your kid likes pink and hearts. Easy to read, accurate, they'll love the pink backlight. Being waterproof is helpful as kids easily forget to not splash around when washing their hands. Price is good, too, as you won't be too upset if/when they lose it. Of course, the kids probably will, if they notice. Timex even provides a discount replacement because they know the probability of loss is high."
2,Please forgive me,All I have to say is that I bought a Britney record. The end times are surely drawing nigh. I still like the song however. It is her best work yet.
1,Detoxifying.,"This is a terrible single for a decent, catchy song. Sonically, the remixes fall flat because they do not really suit the song. If you want a really good remix, download K.O.'s Level 5 Toxicity mix instead of buying this."
1,"Jumping here, jumping there",With the exception of 2 or 3 chapters this book is a complete waste of money - too much useless information in a complete messy manner.
2,The feel GREAT docu of 2008,"If you're feeling a little dejected about humanity in general , there's some great and positive news for you . Since streaming this absolutely wonderful and totally uplifting film , my wife and i have bought , like , eight copies for friends and family . Other folks will tell you the particulars . This film is soul Prozac . Truly do yourself a favor and check it out . It's for what ails you ."
2,This book should not leave your desk...A very good reference,"If you are new or have been using Linux or Unix this is a bookfor you desk next to your computer system. This book has been a pleassureto read and use. I am using the book as a teaching guide forfriends, family, and co-workers.This book caontains two cd's with examples to get your system up and runningas fast as possible. The explains on how to get X windows up.X windows is a windows like interface. The verison of Linuxis Slackware. You can partion your for a seprate installmentor run the system from the CD. Done both. You can use LiLo,a boot loader, to boot OS2, Win95, NT 3.51, and 4.0, I haveNT 4.0 on my system.Yes you can do your internet surfing. I use Netscape gold3.0 under Linux, e-mail, newsgroups, ftp, and etc. In fact thisreview is being done using Netscape under Linux.The main problem that I have found is that some of theexamples are printed small. This is good system to programdevelopement on, and networking."
2,Banana Hammok,Want your banana just hanging in the breeze or do you want your banana hanging in style. Well for the stylish hangers this is the display you want. Looks great and is very heavy duty.
2,"Not just for bananas, anymore!","I can't believe that I'm writing a 'review' about a banana holder, yet here we are.Anyway, get two. One for your bananas, and another for, say, holding your headphones in a stylish and safe manner at your desk/listening area. This little stand works great and, at [...] is SIGNIFICANTLY less than what audio suppliers like to charge their customers for really basic crap (think of how expensive audio-branded speaker / component stands and the like are). Anyway, there's an idea for ya.I don't even eat bananas, lol."
2,Outstanding director,"Daugthers of Darkness is more than a surreal masterpiece.It's an unforgettable experience.But for when on DVD more of Harry Kumel'sfilms, as the eerie Malpertuis? SOS to Amazon to urge who cares for restoring this and other treasures of the seventh art."
1,Save yourself! Don't see this hideous film!,"Worse than a merely bad film is a self-important bad film. This monstrosity drips with artsy pretensions, yet is so poorly written, acted and directed that it doesn't even amuse in its badness. By the end of it I felt like a traumatized prisoner.Notes to the director: eerie lighting and bad lighting are two different things. I felt like I needed a flashlight to see what was going on - but then again, maybe the lack of lighting was a small mercy paid us by the director.The screenplay is entirely incoherent, and the actors are absolutely clueless. There's supposed to be some sort of oh-so-erotic lesbian imagery in here, but I've seen better eroticism in the worst European sexploitation films."
2,Amazingly deep for its length,"A slim book, only 86 pages. It's the story of a woman who has just lost her father and is dealing with that, and at the same time trying to get pregnant, something she's been struggling with for a long time. A very likable narrator. Fusselman does a great job of conveying emotional depth with very few words."
2,Live and hilarious but missing something.,"Hi, all. This is a fantastic piece of comedy of which I laugh all the way through it. I once saw protions of it along time ago and finally got a copy. But, somethings missing! The SCHOOL ROLE CALL. Anybody know of it, and know were I can get hold of it?"
1,Cheesy Heroes,"My three-year old grandson loves anything to do with firetrucks and firemen, but he didn't like this DVD. It was ridiculous. The two actors were really cheesy and stupid."
2,safer replacement for traditional wax candle,Safer than a traditional wax candle. Gives the same amount of light. I use this on my Nursing Graduation while reciting the Florence Nightingale pledge. Looks nicer on a low light room.
1,Don't last,"Batteries don't last very long, a few days at most. I've bought similar lights in the past that would stay lit for weeks."
2,EXCELLENT FLICKERING LED CANDLES!,"I bought this 12-candle pack for Christmas decor and I'm really satisfied with product quality. Flame effect is life-like, I put on a frosted-glass votive and flickering effect is amazing!!! Uses CR2032 lithium batteries, best battery for LEDs, as we know, LED uses few amperage, not drain your batteries like a conventional bulb, so battery can last for years....I'll buy 4 packs more!"
1,This was a disappointment,"I found this book to be a disappointment. I was taken aback by the author's decision to summarily exclude some groups because he felt they were insufficiently Christian for inclusion and by his decision to interlace his descriptions of the various denominations he covers with his opinion of the ""right answers"" in terms of their doctrinal positions.I would recommend the purchase of the most recent edition of Mead's Handbook of Denominations in the United States over this book. It is broader in scope and relates the views of the various groups without the partisan commentary."
2,great book if you want to know the science behind Cryonics,Goes through and explains the science behind cryonics. It disproves what many of the cryonics detractors assert. Over all a good read!
1,Why is Amazon charging for Kindle version of this?,This story is well over 50 years old and in the public domain so why is Amazon charging for the Kindle version of this? It should be free. And it is free - a quick Google search will reveal full text versions that you can read online for free.
1,Where's the 3D?,I watched the whole thing without the glasses - with them it was just dark and not 3D at all. Very disappointed.
1,One boys dream of flying and finding the girl of his dreams,"I suppose one of the things I have come to expect about 3D movies is they feature effects that take advantage of the 3D effect. This movie does little of that. This is the story of two young kids, a boy and girl. He dreams of flight, she is a natural engineer. Later in life they are best friends but deal with a military pilot trying to steal her heart. The acting is poor. The photography is mostly amazing.Some of the scenes shot over Lake Powell become tedious with endless stalls and boring close-ups of people in the cockpit. There is very little of what is featured in the case/cover photograph. If you're looking for a Blue Angels in 3D type video, this is not for you. If you're looking for non-actors with lots of actor close-ups generally filmed in 3D than this might be the ticket.I would have rather seen a best-of at Oshkosh in 3D instead. I wish I had never purchased this 'movie.'"
1,Ultimate Writer's Cramp,"Once again Imax has tried to combine a story with spectacular photography. I would think by know I would have learn my lesson. But you mention the word Imax combine with the Grand Canyon,Lake Powell and aerial photography I took the bait. This story is so simple that it takes away from the film. I feel if you do not have an interesting story to tell why try. Instead of going the educational or thrill route they went with a story that was hard to get through once let alone twice. Why Imax could settle for a plot like this when they are consistently A+ in the photo and sound department is a wonder to me. There standards can be so high on one end and at the bottom of the scale on the other. Imax has produce quite a few good films. But for my money those are films that are educatonal or have thrilling photography. This film has some of the photography but it allso has a story that will put you to sleep."
1,Disappointing Quality and Content,"This 3D Blu-ray has the potential to be wonderful, but it falls short. Most of the 3D effect has ghosting throughout most of the video. Its like everything is out of focus. Also, the plot is silly and pointless. Save your money."
1,This is definitely NOT ELP!,"ELP should have quit while they ahead with ""Black Moon"" (1992) and ""Live at the Royal Albert Hall"" (1993) in terms of their ephemoral 90's comeback. ""In the Hot Seat"" was just tarnished by quick-fix greed in terms of the quality its tracks are presented in. There isn't a single shred of any timeless ELP instrumental quirks to be found in any of these songs, and the 90's update of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is just plain dolorous! ""Hand of Truth"", ""One By One"", and ""Daddy"" are the only tracks that get the dubious honor of gold, silver, and bronze from me. One last ""below the belt"" blow on ""In the Hot Seat"" would be that even under the influence of a 12-pack, ""Love Beach"" (1978) would sound like heavy dynamic make-out music (HAH)!"
2,"It's Good; Not Sure if ""Superfast"" is the Word, Though...","I just received this cookbook and was super excited to see some pretty awesome recipes in it. My only question is about the choice of the term ""Superfast."" To me, a wife that works full time, weekday dinners need to be fast. And, there is a plethora of information out there on fast meals, but most aren't too healthy. I need a combination of both. And, I thought this would be it.But, I think the term fast means something different to me. These are quick, easy recipes for 7PM on a Monday when I get home. These require a lot of additional prep that I wasn't looking for.It will be great for weekends when I have more time, but for weekdays, I continue my search. Looking for the holy grail that is the truly healthy, yet quick, weekday cookbook. The search continues! =)"
2,A very good reader,I thought the reader for this book was very good. He did Palpatine's voice especially well. I also felt that the book filled in gaps about character motivations that there wasn't time to cover in the movie. I felt the book enriched my experience of the movie.
1,Where's the witty dialogue?,"The thing that hooked me on the Star Wars saga was the incredibly constant bickering and arguing that happens in episodes IV and V: C3PO and R2D2, Han Solo and Leia, Darth Vader and the other Imperial commanders.However, in episodes I, II, and now in III, the dialogue is flat. I was falling asleep while reading the conversations in this book. Episodes I, II and III apparently are nothing more than an attempt to see how many computer-generated droids can be blown up in each movie. What a pity. What a waste of my time."
2,I Envy Lee Pulos,"When I pulled several hypnosis books off the library shelf to review, ""Beyond Hypnosis"" did not quite appeal to me. The cover was unattractive and quite plain. However, an inner-awareness told me to check out the book and to read it. I did so.I enjoyed the book immensely, enough to order a copy for myself! Mr Pulos' book put the hypnosis phenomena into a perspective that allowed me to comprehend and apply the principals to my daily activities. I actually was able to hypnotize myself for a brief period. I envy the author for his intelligence and insight.Between readings, I left the book on my bed. Without prodding, my wife skimmed the book; I knew that she is skeptical about these things. To my surprise, she read the book in its entirety. She said that she could relate to many of the elements in the book. She commented that this was one of the few books from which we both received mutual enlightenment! The book also served as a foundation for further reading on hypnosis."
2,"A part of our history, A wonderful movie of all times...","The actors cannot ever be replaced from the original movie. I LOVE this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen, I guess because you can really see a lot of the truth in it. When Scarlett says, I'll worry about it tomorrow, thats her way of dealing with the pain of Rhett leaving. To survive this is the way you must think or else you would go insane. So much emotion involved in this movie. There will never be another ""GONE WITH THE WIND""......"
2,the reason we have 5 stars,The first epic saga. Vivien Leigh is magnificent and Hattie McDaniel deserved an award. You sure don't need me to tell you about Gone with the Wind. A must for and and all movie buffs.Just wanted to say I'm pleased with the DVD version.
1,i would have rated it higher if only I can watch it,"It keeps stopping, I pause it and start it up again the volume doesnt start right away, so you dont know what there saying, I pause it and start it and it keeps saying try again later can't connect, waste of money, won't watch a amazon movie again!!!"
2,1.33:1 Ratio,"The only thing bothers me is this movie is not a widescreen format.But after careful research, now I know that it was shot originally that way back in 1930s.What can I do? Cut the bottom and the top to look like widescreen format?The dvd I have is actually 1.85:1. I think they really cut the top and the bottom to look like widescreen alright for the DVD.Perfect movie for sure. No doubt about it.Very food picture quality. Perfect Bluray."
1,Not Wide-Screen Version,"Re: ""Gone With the Wind"" (The Scarlett Edition): Beware. Even though this 3-disc set is Blu-Ray, the movie itself is not widescreen format. I certainly have no desire to pay almost $30.00 to watch an epic film like ""Gone With The Wind"" as an old square picture (with black on either side of the square imate) on my HD tv. How disappointing. If you want the widescreen version, don't purchase this particular item."
2,This is the greatest movie of the century....,"This movie is an epic....and while, true, it does not meticulously keep with the novel, it is still the greatest love story of the cinematic ""Hollywood glory days"". Vivien Leigh is ""Scarlett O'Hara"", not only does she fit the description, she just becomes the character heart and soul. And there could absoulutely be no one else who could be Rhett but Clark Gable. The casting is perfect, the sets are so realistic, and the story moves along; even though it is four hours long, the movie just flies by. It is a classic, and should be seen by everyone who loves movies. This is the way movies were meant to be."
2,One of the best movies of all time,I love this movies so much. I forget how many times I have watched it. And every time I watch it gives me new excitement.
2,What? No widescreen? Sacrilege!,"I was very disappointed to find my all-time favorite film, GWTW, treated so rudely with the release of this DVD. A film of this caliber deserves better. Though the transfer could have been better, I found it acceptable. The soundtrack was less enjoyable, however. While I realize there is only so much one can do to enhance a fifty-year-old recording, I was surprised at how shrill and tinny-sounding it was. The major disappointments for me were the lack of bonus materials (very cheesy, Warner Bros.), and the non-widescreen format (unforgivable). I certainly hope that Warner will offer upgrade pricing to owners of this version when the inevitable ""Special Edition"" is released (uh-huh, right)! Happily though, as with all classics, this film is still pure magic!"
1,Romantic Racism,"You have to give credit to this film for its glossy, epic sweep and the fact that it breaks new ground in filmmaking techniques. Unfortunately, the film, like the novel, promotes a destructive, romantic myth of a south that never really existed.In this Technicolor version of the Old South all the darkies are happy and smiling and dancing on the banks of the Mississippi, and obviously it's too bad the Civil War came along and ruined things. What a trashy message, and the terrible thing is that its wrapped in such a seductive and attractive package."
1,"Awful, twice over!","I bought this for a Mother's Day gift--TWICE.My mom reported that most of the discs didn't work, so I returned it for a new set. Amazingly, the new replacement set didn't work either! I felt bad enough for Mom that I had to write this review and warn others.I finally learned my lesson: Take Mom out for dinner and a play instead of wasting time and money on this piece of....er, junk."
2,Gone With the Wind,Very happy with the DVD and the timely manner in which it was shipped. Amazon always does an amazing job of gettingthe product out to the customer. Thank you. I give this item a 5 star rating.
2,Gone With the Wind is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!,There isn't a whole lot to say that hasn't already been said about Gone With The Wind. What a magnificent motion picture for it's day and now for today as well. The DVDS' are a tribute to this must have film for your home library.
1,boring,I hope I'm watching the same movie that got so many 5 stars!! I found this movie to be big time boring. Couldn't even handle fast forward :)
1,gone with the wind,"This sucked because it arrived with only one dvd in it, it should of had two. I wanted to return it but my printer is dead so I couldn't print the return so I wasted my money. this the second purchase in a row from amazon that was bad i am sure it will be a while before I order from amazon again if i ever do."
2,most excellent,"At least for the beginner (myself), this was great for learning how to give a back massage."
1,These books are terrible!,Before you buy the Remote Access book from Tom Thomas read my comments on Tom Thomas's BCSN book.
2,Wonderful!,"Despite having seen and enjoyed the film featuring Humphrey Bogart, I got this book, knowing it deviated from the screenplay (or, rather, the screenplay had deviated from this original novel!). I was very glad to have read this. Only the setting and names are the same - otherwise, a completely different, very suspenseful and psychologically wrought piece. Highly recommend."
2,For Maggie the Mod dog,"If you are one of those consumers (as I am) that will purchase products because of aesthetics, then this product is for you/your dog. We have the large version and it is almost too big for our black lab--it holds a lot of food. The bowl has a nice weight to it and non-skid feet. Please note that our turquoise bowl faded, and although this bowl is dishwasher-safe we washed it by hand. The underside of the bowl stayed bright turquoise, but the exposed side faded quite a bit in a few months. The polymer material the bowl is constructed of is heavy and sturdy, however, it is also very rigid and I discovered that if you drop the bowl it breaks into many sharp pieces. It's a great design and I would recommend purchasing it if you like the design, but expect the color to fade and handle carefully."
1,Rabin Solo Album + Yes,"If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes, you will probably like this one. I think it sounds pretensious and uninspired. Chris Squire is missing in action. Alan White pulls some strong beats out of the can, but the rest is pure Rabin.There are some songs I can stand but most I can't listen to all the way through. I got this for [low price] in the bargin bin and I am not sure I got a good deal.-A long time Yes fan"
2,Best Yet!,I don't know what makes this product different from the others but so far it's the best I've used yet. I'm able to do just about anything within minutes of painting my nails.
2,Amazing!,"I love this product! I really love all of OPI's products... but this works really well for me. After a minute they are dry to the touch and after 5 minutes they are set. I will say that if you apply base, plus 2 coats of color and then a top coat it will take longer for them to completely dry but your nails will be somewhat dry. If you skip a layer of polish or the base they will dry much quicker."
1,Doesnt work.,Honestly I dont think this product works. I followed instructions carefully and it did not work. My manicure was not fully dry at all.
1,"DW may be better than MS-FrontPage, but ....","I read somewhere that DreamWeaver was released to compete against Microsoft's FrontPage 97-98.Apparently the author was not aware of this fact, or else he would have done his homework and explore the POWER of DreamWeaver.I am working on a GeoCities web page dedicated to some ""tricks"" not covered in this book (or anywhere else). If anyone has any questions, requests, or comments, PLEASE email me. I'm here to help."
2,Place in the woods,Ecellent book to read. If you like wilderness books it is hafta read book. Interesting through out. Book keeps your attention through out
2,I keep going back to this book!,"Green Darkness is one of those rare books that I keep rereading year after year. I just read it again after seeing ""Elizabeth"" and am reminded of what an excellent book this is. It is truly one of my favorites!"
2,100 Stars!!!,"This book was amazing! I absolutely LOVED it. It was hard to believe that this book was written in 1972! Just like in Katherine(written in 1954!), Anya Seton has done it again! I loved this book!"
1,Trying to be Cujo,"Okay, Cujo was a dog gone wrong, while this bear merely wanted revenge for the killing of his mate. But the rest of it seems more like what I wrote as my review title, with some drama thrown in: brother vs. brother and so on."
1,Possibly the worst book ever about motorcycling,"The author may be a great guy but this book is just plain awful. I've read almost every book published on touring and this thing is the worst hands down. If you need to read a ""motorcycle"" book to know it's hot in Texas, Motel 6 has noisy air conditioners, chicken fried steak can be nauseating - and be told this in EVERY FREAKING CHAPTER!, than you may be able to get through his book. I gave up halfway through when the ""poetry"" showed up, it's hard to believe a grown man could write such drivel. I don't think I've ever had a more visceral dislike of a book than I experienced toward this one."
1,doesn't shoot,"when it does shoot, it's awesome. but i got it today and shot it about 200 times and it worked about 5"
1,brothersjudddotcom barely recommends,"When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in 1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, ""Why did this happen to those five?"" Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers & we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous."
1,What am I missing? I found the book dull and unsatisfying.,"I have read all the positive reviews and I am a bit stumped. I found the early chapter about the relationship between the mother and daughter very tedious and meaningless. I almost stopped reading after that chapter, but slogged on through the rest of the book with little uptick in enjoyment. I believe people just feel they have to love and praise the ""classics"" no matter what. I found the book dull and unsatisfying. I'm so glad it was a short book. The most enjoyable part of the book was looking up the many words I did not understand. I'm very glad I put the [...] app on my iPhone."
2,Emerson Lake & Palmer at the top of their game!,"This U.K. Sony re-master is the best sounding of all there re-issues of this album, it's too bad it's being lumped with the Shout Factory version. Get this version it's just tremendous!"
1,Save Your Money,I agree with Jeff's review below. The sound on this thing is horrific. It's mega-compressed and overly bright. The more they mess with this album. the worse it sounds. Go back and find the original Atlantic version...crank up your stereo...and enjoy the *dynamics* of the music.
1,recall,"We obtain a vinyl disc ELP ""Brain salad surgery"" production Shout! factory records. The disc has on both sides of the broad transverse stripes. As Grading is similar to the Fair. It happened at the factory packaging. Although the seller advertised it as new. I would like to sent me a new drive, without damage, and even without an envelope."
1,Pfaltzgraff Dinnerware Set,"One Plate already cracked. I ordered round Serving Bowl, to large! Coffee Mugs to big!"
1,Could have been about skateboarding,"Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled ""Hiking with your bar buddies, are we thirty ,yet?.""Some nice footage. better vids abound."
2,Indian Territory,You cannot get much better than a good Gene Autry movie. The Quality is very good and the restoration is top notch.
2,Singable Psalms,"For over ten years I have shared these settings of the Psalms with Christians and Jews in worship services. Webber's wording is creative and current. His choice of metrical patterns makes these psalms usable with literally hundreds of tunes familiar to all who worship with these ancient Hebrew poems. I could wish Webber had versified the entire Psalter, though he has included most sections regularly in use in English speaking congregations. I warmly recommend using these settings to all who love to sing, and love to sing the psalms. By choosing familiar tunes from any source, a music leader can newly invigorate several generations of worshippers."
1,Leaves much to desire,The book provides a good chart of all of the Outlook 2000 objects but gives few good programming examples. Nowhere does it show how to login as an outlook user and then create and send an email. Spends too much time on the Outlook database vs. task list as if it were the only part of Outlook a developer would be interested. Not worth the money.
1,"LOVE Jim Croce, the ""remastering"" sucks!","The remastering makes the recording tinny & lacks depth.Sad thing to do to Jim Croce's music.This was the BEST album made, the music was originally some of the most beautiful, earthy, talented music ever recorded...There may have been some poorly remastered dicks & some not? so you might want to take a chance & see what it sounds like to you. I did NOT get mine here, so cold have been a bad run???The album is fantastic! Jim Croce died WAY too young. He was VERY talented."
2,Oustanding collection,"This album was a must-have for me because of all the tracks in general and one in particular. It is also a well-made album with very good acoustic quality. ""Time in a Bottle"" is a special song for my wife and I. So is ""I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song""; and there are other favorites on this and other albums. In January 2011 we celebrated our 40th Anniversary with dinner at Croce's Restaurant in San Diego. (Owned by his widow Ingrid. If you are a Jim Croce fan and in or visiting San Diego, going here should be at or near the top of your to-do list.)"
1,Horrible text,"My daughter uses this series for sixth grade Social Studies. I think it is among the worse textbooks I have ever seen. The book is written as a narrative with no bullets, highlights, underlined points or emphasis of any kind. The problem with this is the first time reader of American History needs to know what is important and what they need to focus on. They have no base knowledge of the subject and not all fact are equal. In addition, there is no glossary which is annoying for the students when creating flash cards for assessments. I am not going to go into the inaccuracies of the text (there are quite a few) or the obvious religious biased, but I think that a more structured book is appropriate for first time American History student. This book is more of ""reader"" then a text- they don't even have question or a vocabulary list for each chapter."
1,Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.,Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After 1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a 10 year old Casio watch that is used in swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
2,"Fantasic HRM with all the features you need, a best buy","I have used this HRM for 4 months now and love it. I mainly use it riding my bike. Comes with a handlebar quick-mount for bike that is nice to use so can see it always without taking hands of bar.Trying to decide I found Polar (and others) had too many models and they carefully structured features/price to make you spend $50 to $150 more. This HRM has a ton of features (all that I need) and a great flexible display. I don't think it has a light.While working I like to display the Heart menu so I can see % of max constantly and a % graph and my current HR. It's easy to move thru the menus and see all the info. Keeps a running tally of calories, I think I burned 20,000 so far.The Sigma Sport website is very well done and shows all the info you need to decide. This is a best buy."
2,Tarzan rocks,"My son had this game when he was young and I just loved to play it. This copy does try to act up on me a little but with patience, I can get it working. I love this game!"
2,A poigant book,"This book was wonderful when I read it as a child, and now when I read it. It's incredible, a very grown up tale , yet it can be read at any age. Rumer Godden is a wonderful author, and this book will capture your heart like nothing else - except maybe The Mouse and his Child. It is the story of a family living in The DollHouse, and learning to come to terms with themselves, it is both happy and sad........but ultimately rewarding."
1,Very disturbing book,"I have to agree with the others who warn that this book is unsuitable for children. In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did. Based on my first-hand experience of how this book reads from the perspective of a child, I wholeheartedly advise parents not to subject their children to it. There are better choices."
2,"Strange, strange book...","I am unable to categorize this book. As the title says, this is about advanced Perl programming, but chapter 1-9 really belongs in ""Programming Perl"" (but are totally missing from it), and should really not be considered advanced (on the other hand, quite elementary, but since they appear nowhere else, you should probably consider this book a must read, if you are serious about Perl).The rest of the book is pretty random, covering various topics the author thought was neat, and wanted to write about. This is ranging from trivial use of CPAN libraries (Tk), to trivial Perl but involving knowledge from other disciplines (networking), to actual useful advanced Perl programming (persistence, template-driven code-generation, and the C programming interface). This part of the book is also highly recommended (and in fact the reason I bought it), but should have been much longer."
2,Excellent Resource,"O'Relly books are generally great sources and this one is no exception. I've been programming with Perl for CGI, NetAdmin, SysAdmin, and various data tasks for almost 4 years. Anybody who knows Unix will know a lot more by knowing Perl and advanced Perl takes you to the next level. Tell archie to stop whining and cop to his real name..."
1,Short-Lived,"When it worked, it was great: easy to use, and easy to clean.The problem is that the power started cutting out, less than six months after purchase. The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself. I kept my receipt, filled out the warranty card, etc, thinking that if I had a problem, GE would honor the one-year warranty, which is suppose to replace any part which is defective...no such luck.First of all, you are expected to take it to a GE servicer, and pick it up later, or else you have to pay a fee to have it serviced in your home. Then I was given the run-around because they tried to say the cord was damaged after it was delivered to the store that sold it, but the store said it was GE's responsibility.Basically, don't buy this microwave if you expect GE to honor the warranty. I ended up buying another brand from a different store to avoid this scenario again.I recommend theEmerson .9 cu. ft. 900-Watt Microwave -."
1,Poor Quality,I don't recommend this microwave. Think it only lasted about a year. A little over...spend a little more and get something that will last longer. Evidently the parts on this were not made to last long. One day it just started being really noisy and no cooking think that says the magnetron (microwave producing element) was dead. I am glad i did not review after purchase coz now can let folks know it is not made to last...I will get another brand this time around!
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I bought these last spring for trapping and they lasted the one week I trapped muskrats with just a small leak, I thought i just went over the top of them a little bit. Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak. Then this fall trapping muskrats and raccoon this fall they just completely fell apart the soles started falling off, they had big rips near the calf, and the part that attaches to your belt broke, and the next day the other one fell off! So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap! I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just a horrible product. I would not even buy another Hodgman product. I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it."
1,Waste of money,"These waders only lasted three outings. They were always rinsed off after use, hung to dry, then stored properly, stuffed with newspaper. By the beginning of the fourth outing, the left boot had cracked, where the foot flexes at the toes. By the end of the trip, the right one had cracked in the same spot. They aren't worth the money, or the soaked feet."
2,A starter for any potential Orb fan!,"I remember the first time I heard an Orb song. It was during one of my weekened/midnight excursions around Dallas and they played ""Fluffy Little Clouds"" I got the weirdest sensation when I first listend to this song. Felt like someone was lightly running the tip of a very cold knife up and down my spine. I LIKED IT! So I ran out and grabbed this particular album. Some of the songs grabs you immediately. Others take time to grow on you.Having said that if you get any of their other albums, don't expect the same. Expect DIFFERENT....very different styles and samplings.I give it 4 in stead of 5, because I'm hoping for a better album when it comes out."
2,A great album,"This is a really nice ambient album, the kind of album you can close your eyes and think while listening to it, also a good album to go to sleep to. If you like ambient music buy it, if you haven't heard ambient buy it to see what ambient is."
1,Your 10-year-old brother with a trance track,"Once again I've been suckered by glowing reviews into purchasing an album that could have been made by an auto plant robot. It's basically the opening track of ""Dark Side of the Moon"" overlaid with old newscast voices and your little brother blowing bubbles through his straw. The best I can say for this is that it's not as obnoxious as Lesiem's ""Mystic Spirit Voices."" I'm sticking with Steve Roach."
1,USB connection in tablet fails.,I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
2,Sounds immediately attracted my 7 year old Grandson,The musical sounds immediately attracted the attention of my 7 year old Grandson. It is a charming disc and one worth purchasing.
1,great propoganda,This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
1,"A decent mug, but it has poor insulation","If you like to drink your coffee fast, this is the mug for you! Even with preheating, coffee only stays hot for 2 hours. The outside of the mug feels warm immediately after filling. I expected better performance. Other features are fine such as the stylish look and tight seal, but for an extra five bucks you can get a top of the line travel mug that performs its core function better."
1,Doesn't flow; big disappointment,"I had the prior version of this mug and loved it. As other posters have noted, Trudeau unfortunately changed the design of the lid for the worse. The new lid, which screws into the mug, does not permit an adequate flow of the coffee when it is in the open position. Drinking it while I drove my car, I had to literally lean my head back and use gravity to get enough coffee to come out. That lead to the coffee leaking onto my shirt (which I should have seen coming). I tried to loosen the screw on the bottom of the lid as others mentioned, but I still can't get enough coffee to come out of it when it's in the open position. I don't have the same problems with it leaking that some others have mentioned, but that just tells me that this is an inconsistent, poorly made product."
1,Disappointed,When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out. I tried to adjust screw of lid as was suggested. It worked but next time I used it it went back to allowing very little of liqui to come out. I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from.
1,The reviews are for the wrong performance!,"The performance is, according to the description, by Jansug Kakhidze, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, not Rattle. What's going on? Did I download Kakhidze or Rattle? It would be nice to know. The performance I heard sounded pretty lightweight compared to others I've heard, but I don't know who's performance I heard."
1,"Only symbols and images, no concepts!","This book does tell you some essential things about LINUX, but this is not enough at all. Being surrounded by pictures and tips, I really can't learn anything that concerns the main part of LINUX. It is no better than a thickened Redhat user's manual! Too Pratical! If you really want to ""LEARN"" LINUX, you'd better go and buy RUNING LINUX which is far better than this book!"
2,Classic!,"I first heard about Larry from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The thing I like best about Larry is he shows you can be funny without cursing and making sex jokes left-and-right. I think most commedians curse just to get people in the audience.Larry is funny, and you don't have to be raised in the South to appreciate him, though it couldn't hurt."
2,"Excellent book, worth buying.","""Cats for Dummies is a book for any cat lover or owner. I recommend it."
2,It takes a lot of time and practice,"The graphics in this game were somewhat bad, but the game itself is very amusing. Some levels are fun and some make you want to tear your hair out. I like the fact that Bugs Bunny literally lives on 6 hit points (from what I remember) and basically infinite lives. There were ton of levels in the game where it takes a lot of time and practice to get right and sometimes they become frustrating. It actually took me years to finally complete this game one time. As a kid and even for adults, this game is enjoyable."
2,...Here's To One More...,"Not often does an indie band make such a hugh impression, but impressions aren't everything it seems nowadays.Why isn't this band huge? It doesn't always require a major label to get the job done. There is just enough radio friendly catchyness here to make an impact.Maybe that's why it's not really nessecary, these songs in this album stand together or alone so perfectly balancing one another that it demands to be listened to from track one to ten. Female vocals occasionally finding there way in add such a depth, a relaztion to the songs, that you stop everything and just listen. These songs aren't dancehall or heavy metal, but this album proves the potential of dramatic freeform rock, which isn't in your face.My hat goes off to Lydia, but no 5 stars sadly in my book, becuase I felt like they could've done so much more here. Every song feels ready to be implanted with the growth of something more, but it just never happens.Can't wait to hear more."
2,Excellent Reference for BIND version 4,"This Book is a must have for anyone seriously doing DNS work today. The upcoming 3rd edition will cover BIND Version 8, but the substance of DNS and how it works on the Internet is fully and delightfully covered in both previous editions.The Authors are completely knowledgeable about DNS and share that knowledge in a straighforward comfortable style that makes DNS & BIND a fun read while imparting loads of DNS wisdom."
1,Great idea...too much errata,"I bought this book thinking it would be a nice kick-start to ASP and Visual InterDev. I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day 1.The coding, which standards change from day to day, leaves out important details, chnages methods in doing the same tasks, and if you type it directly from the book, will cause your programs from Day 2 on to not work correctly.The amount of errata makes what could have been a good book a sub-standard one, and what is worse is that the Author only lists 2 errata on his website, when I found multiple errata throughout the book...at least 2-3 per 'day'.Stick with a WROX beginners book and you'll fair much better and save yourself some frustration.I've been programing for over 10 years, and without my previous knowledge, I would have never figured out the errors in the coding."
1,Arabian Prince bombs on his comeback CD...,"I got this CD not too long ago, I expected songs similar to the album 'Brother Arab', but Arabian Prince changed up his style. Now he used slow synthed strings, and more sexual lyrics then before. He found another rapper named Side Show to help back him up, probably because Arabian Prince wasn't use to this kind of rap style. The album had the gangsta beat with too much emphasis on b-tches and f----n. There are maybe three tracks that are enjoyable to listen to, but the other ones sound to repetitive or just too slow. The highlight of the album is the song ""Underworld"" when Arabian Prince brings back a fast tempo song about the ghetto. The best slow-synth song would be ""Ho's 2 Bozack"". A.Prince brings a lot of the NWA's production crew to make the album. I don't have the import version of this album, but i think there are maybe one or two bonus songs."
2,Excellent production of a classic story,"If you enjoyed Good Bye Mr Chips and Harry Potter, you'll enjoy this moving saga of a former soldier, shattered by the horrors of trench warfare, who finds his true calling in teaching at a British boarding school between the World Wars."
2,Five Easy Gardens- Anyone can grow the prime...,"This book is an invaluable asset in showing the home grower something that all the other books virtually overlook, a production budget! Each easy garden is detailed with step-by-step, and itemized list of components with cost, and typical output. The reader can determine which methods most resemble something they could achieve... This will move all growers that are getting started in the right direction.We, at Spice of Life Seeds, routinely advise new growers to purchase one of Señor Cervantes books. They are never disappointed. All the Best to Jorge, and I look forward to his next releases."
1,Out of date,"There are still some sound principles in this book, but it's a decade old and you can get all of the same information but updated and in full color in Jorge's other books.Jorge should either update this book or take it out of print because there are a dozen other better books on growing, including his own.I returned this book after reading a few chapters..."
2,good for sensitive skin,"truly good, this product is light weight and not at all greasy. It is pretty good on very sensitive skin, and after i used it the first night there was a noticeable difference in my acne, like they were reduced and my skin felt much softer. Great product."
2,Good old fashioned entertainment,"First of all, the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sound quality is a bit variable; some episodes are better than others. But given the age of the original recordings and the necessary transfer to the new format, I can't complain. This is a ripping yarn of the best quality, each part about 15 minutes long, so I find it great for filling in those short breaks in my day when I have a half hour to kill. The story is damn close to the original book by Sax Rohmer, and it works really well as a serial. Don't expect political correctness, though! If you want a good old fashioned adventure yarn with some creepy overtones, give it a go. (And the company do a buy one get one free for overseas customers)"
2,Great band,"Why didn't I heard about this band?Back in the seventies listened STYX,KANSAS,SUPERTRAMP and the likes,but I never heard about ANGEL. Thanks for these reissues I accidentally stumbled on them.What a treat.All 4 albums are great and if you like seventies music,you must buy ANGEL. they A RE FANTASTIC."
2,Dark and disturbing,"Intense, riveting look at the heroin business, as cops Patric and Jason-Leigh get sucked into their under cover roles. Look fast for Greg Allman as a smack dealer. But be warned, this movie has got some real unhappy moments!!!"
2,A drug movie that's really a love story,"I like this movie. I saw it years ago when it first came out and it really ""stayed with me."" The thought of having to immerse yourself in the drug culture to do your job, and then finding it so difficult not to succumb to the addiction. Very powerful story. Not a feel good movie, but one that you can definitely get personally involved in!"
2,Red Hart Magic,This book gives insight into the history of England during one of its turblent periods. It also gives a clear look at the problems facing children in new and strange circumstances. It is great reading for early teens.
1,boring,I am a confirmed obsessive Linkin Park fan. I personally found this a bit boring. This is unauthorized so it did not have enough of the band contributing to the project.
2,White Plasti Dip,"I use this product to cover my metal flower baskets that hang in my garden. I wish that it covered better and I didn't have to spray so many coats. Very time-consuming and uses product up quickly. However, does the job and I will purchase again."
2,Outdoor thermometer,"The Thermometer itself seems to be a good product, but there was no protective packaging in the box; therefore the thermometer arrived with a broken piece (which fortunately my husband was able to superglue back on)."
2,outdoor thermometer,pleased with the size of the numbers....easy to read and the accuracy of the temp is reasonabley close to weather reports.
1,it stopped working accurately!!!,"I had one similar for many years that was accurate until someone's dog jumped up and knocked if off the fence breaking it. I bought this to replace it, however, I can't imagine how this can't work unless it is made of really shoddy materials. It reads way off the correct temperature as told by my radio controlled weather station.My advice - don't buy it. The manufacturers will get the message eventually and make a decent product. As long as we are buying and putting up with shoddy goods they will keep producing them making us part of the problem!!!"
1,Disappointed,I ordered this thermometer as a gift for my mom and didn't even give it too her. It felt flimsy and cheap.
2,Misunderstood?,"I've read a lot of negative reviews about this film, but I absolutely love it. Can't really tell you why - the music, the characters, the way all the characters mesh, the storyline. I also happen to love a few of these actors - Keven Kline, Steve Martin and Danny Glover, people who always make a film enjoyable for me, no matter what surrounds them. I guess I just want to say, if you've read a few negative reviews, please be aware that not everybody hates this film. You may want to give it a try, and you may actually enjoy it."
1,a real piece of junk,"This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful, if they would just stay on the handle. I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad. The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor. I give up on Mr Clean mop products."
1,Worst mop ever!,It doesn't pick up the grime just moves it around...you think you get quality when buying a trusted name such as Mr. Clean. I can't believe this is on shelves...
1,SUCKS! SPONGE WONT STAY ON!,This product sucks. The sponge that pops in really easily also POPS BACK OUT even more easily.Basically you get a mope handle that assembles fairly easily and no mop to go with it.
2,Again I have the movie/book/and tape series...use them in class,"The first time I read this I knew this was perfect for teacher, coaches, counselors the whole smear...never a better book written except maybe the bible/or Vince Lombardi's Run To Daylight."
2,"""A Voice Many Seek but Few Ever Hear""","I first came across the works of Denis Waitley in late 1996, as I began my first steps towards entrepreneurship. It was via audio tape, which contained most if not all of the contents of this book, nonetheless, here was a complete stranger telling Me: I could succeed, I could achieve, I could do things - encouragement I was not getting from my immediate family, my peers, my ""friends"" at that time.Someone once said: You will become like the information you input into your mind and the people you associate with. If that's the truth, then, I am indeed one step closer to where I wish to be in my life, and YOU can be there, too."
1,The Psychology of Winning,"Your ad made it look like I was purchasing the actual book, The Psychology of Winning.What you sent me was some cheap workbook that was of absolutely NO use to me. I was extremely disappointed"
2,cd review,The classic Oscar Peterson Trio makes jazz music like no other and the quality of this re-mastering is exceptional. As an audiophile I can't recommend this cd highly enough. It has become one of my reference cd's. The opening cut has some of the best recorded bass I've ever heard and the other instruments are equally well represented. Buy and enjoy.
1,really for dummies...,"It was my first ""for dummies"" book and most probably the last. The book is big and empty; the author should have used at most 50 pages. The CD contains short musical clips that you've probably heard before or you can download for free. I gave it two stars because the book actually helps a small tiny bit contrary to its size.I recommend instead ""Alfred's Group Piano for Adults"" it's much better but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there."
1,Look elsewhere.,"Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here."
1,Who's the Dummy?,"I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good ""easy books"" on teaching beginners the piano."
1,"Worse remake than Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, or Oh.. Just any of them","Please people, stop going to see remakes. If we stop going, they will stop making them. Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong. Much worse. I agree 100% with Floyd the Barber's review. The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history. The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment. I had serious high hopes for this film. I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake. But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down. Most people in this country don't have health care. But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this. So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money. Ban all remakes. Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out! Thank you, that is all."
2,tremendous!!!,Just go see it!! Art for the sake of art. please ignore sierocks review...the message of the film is beyond him!!
1,Silly and Too Dramatic,"I love the other films Peter Jackson has made. The best is Heavenly Creatures, if you have not seen this movie your missing out! I thought this movie was overly dramatic and to long. Had many unbeliveable moments and was so far fetched! The only cool thing about it was the natives, they were freaky."
2,Spectacular!,"Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show. And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger-than life story. The production was phenomenal in almost every way. In one instance, when Kong was sliding autos around the streets of Broadway, like a kid crashing matchbox cars, did the action look like CG creation (something in the sliding ape didn't look convincing). In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.Watch for character nuances in the non-speaking CG role of Kong, and you'll see another reason this 3rd-generation remake justifies the hype it got. Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow. Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment."
2,Great But Not Quite Five Stars,This movie was excellent. It borrows a lot from the original with incredible special effects and amazing recreations of 1931 New York! King Kong finally moves like a real gorilla and the destruction that gets wrecked throughout the movie is very convincing! The natives of this movie look like something out of the Exorcist although there was a tribute to the original natives during the scene where Kong is displayed to the New York public at the theater.There are a lot more dinousaurs in this one including a lot of prehistoric insect creatures that look convincingly real. I didn't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:- many of the scenes seemed to be excruciatingly long- I was not crazy about Jack Black's portrayal of Carl Denham- I may have been a little bit prejudiced having seen the original so I knew exactly what was going to happen. I am sure people being introduced to Kong for the first time will love it!
1,King Kong & Bionic Woman,"Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises, no welts and unbroken bones. Another failed attempt to create a modern epic with an intended complete menu which ended up a spoiled meal."
2,"Kong, the Miniseries","They should have just made this a miniseries and then they would have been able to have more side stories and characters that they seemed to want. BUT, they put it all in one movie. Overall, good movie, there are some tense moments (dinosaur chase, bug attack)..and it all reminded me of Jurrassic Park. King Kong was animated really well, but everything else was kind of wierd looking and you could tell it was green screen behind them (but I guess that's what they were looking for). You may find yourself forwarding most scenes just to get through this without going crazy. Recommend - - but forward through slow parts."
2,Best King Kong yet,I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white. But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects. The dinosaur fights were excellent. I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl. She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually. Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island. He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature. He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism. I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm. The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one. However I still loved this movie.
2,KING BONG !,"Great movie in HD. Almost as good as the theater. But I had to go to a freinds house to watch it because it wouldnt play (obviously) on my standard DVD player nor (curiously) my Bluray player hmmmmmmmm.... You should probably mention that in the HD descriptions, My bad ;("
1,Visually stunning. But a terriable movie,"BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse.On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny."
1,Too much of a CGI fest,"Just watched KK for the first time. Unaware of the pointless nature of most of the film. I never believed that any of the characters had any personal business on Skull Island.The bugs, dinosaurs, and weird evil natives were as overdone as burnt toast that sets off the smoke alarm. There were too few scenes that would give the movie any positive spin. You know bad guys smashed or something. The point of the movie according to Mr. Jackson was that bugs, people, and dinosaurs are evil and that KK is an overgrown primate trapped in world that tortures him daily and finally kills him. Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache."
1,"Over-Rated, Cheesy, Boring, Corny, OVER-RATED!","By the time everyone gets to Skull Island you are bored. Jurassic Park showed us ground-breaking dinosaur CGI and we were scared by the dinosaurs.Seeing a bloated Jack Black outrun a RAPTOR, while holding his hat onto his head, was more hokey than hokey. I was laughing at how the dinosaurs were flying by everyone (with less than an inch between them) in the stampede.No one seemed at all ""surprised"" by the fact that they ended up on an island filled with prehistoric life.The bug cavern scene was neat, which is why this gets 1 star.Why would Adrian Brody's character go off on his own? Did the bugs decide to ignore him? No one wondered off on their own in Jurassic Park."
2,AN INSTANT CLASSIC!,This was incredible. I cannot wait for this to come on DVD. I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
2,Fun but not Classic,Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action. On bluray it pops and u have yourself a fun popcorn movie.
1,Largely Irrelevant Scholasticism,"After having lived in Cambodia for 2 years and having read several books on Cambodian religion and Buddhism in general, I approached this book with great anticipation. I read it over the course of 3 months, writing a review of each chapter and discussing each chapter in a forum.Generally, I found this book to be of little value in understanding ""New Religious Movements in Cambodia."" The authors demonstrate a noted lack of philosophical self-awareness and thus interpret Cambodian religion through a post-Enlightenment humanistic grid. If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read. This book often is.Chapters 3, 5 and 7 are worthwhile, so it will remain on my shelf."
1,Doesn't work,"I plugged it in to my machine. Windows made ""Chirp"" sound it makes when I plug in a flash drive, and the little green icon in the lower right showed up, that I click to removed the drive, and the J drive appeared in my Folders pane in Windows. But when I clicked on the J drive, I got an error message saying ""Please insert a disk into Drive J"".Doesn't work. POS."
2,The BEST bread flour I have ever used!,"The 50 lbs bag arrived in just a few days.. $4.95 shipping is unbeatable. I bagged it n 1 gallon plastic bags and packed them into a large lard can to keep fresh.. the container is now in our root cellar. For my first loaf I tried a basic French Bread recipe that includes beaten egg whites added to the water.. no oil.. just flour, sugar, yeast, water, salt.. and, from 1lb 4 oz of flour I produced the most awesome, seriously authentic French style baguettes (x2) that I have EVER made! I have no idea what makes this unbleached flour so special, but I'm not looking back!"
2,I love him,IT WAS CCCCCRACK!!!i love him and the album i think that it was betta lyrically then from me to u~but i love santana and the whole movement ever since it start i loved cam back when he was with mase so i am a dipset fan but really its good
1,Juelz should be missing his tongue,"Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money."
2,MUST HAVE!,Awsome movie! Colorful! Entertaining! Funny and Sad! You will never get tired watching it over and over again!
2,It's A Wonderful Life,"This is an awesome and timeless classic for the entire family. Just when you think you're life isn't going so well, watch this movie and it reminds you of what really is important in life. I recommend it highly and it's a great addition to your movie library."
2,One of the Greatest Christmastime Movies of All Time!,"I've loved this movie since I first saw it when I was 10 years old. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are two of the greatest actors that ever lived! My sister and I love to sing along with the ""Sisters"" song. (Speaking of which, if anyone knows where I can get a copy of that music please email me at ChristineDaae19@hotmail.com. My sister and I are looking for it for a variety show that we're doing for our church.) But seriously, it's one of the greatest Christmas musicals I've ever seen! The dancing and singing are spectacular and the songs are catchy. You might find yourself going around humming songs from that. This movie is a definite buy for those who love old musicals and want to get into the Christmas spirit."
2,White Christmas DVD,My mom and I would watch this movie every year when I was growing up. It just did not seem like Christmas until we watched White Christmas.
1,Terrible transfer: bad color alignment and often audio sync issues.,"Unfortunately the DVD I purchased is worse than my aging VHS copy of this wonderful film. The color on this copy is out of alignment, resulting in a double film image (a separation between color and black-and-white). Bing's ""baby blues"" are lower than were they're supposed to be and hairlines (especially in the beginning when the men are in uniform) have a large color gap where you can see black and white (almost as if this were a colorized black and white film). I also had some trouble with the audio sync. I may have a bad copy, given all the good reviews but clearly this DVD is unwatchable! Big disappointment. I am returning it for a refund."
2,One of the best Christmas movies,"One of the best Christmas movies. Our family has been decorating our Christmas Trees for over 20 years, and this is the movie that we watch each time. We needed to get it on DVD because the VCR version probably won't last much longer."
2,My favorite holiday movie,Such a deal getting it as a digital download. It will always be available when I need it! doesn't clutter up the DVD shelf for the remaining 11 months of the year.
2,Great Classic!,A must-see for the Christmas season! I love Rosemary Clooney. Danny Kaye is wonderful in this movie - fun music.
2,good movie,I havent seen this one yet but my wife says its a good one so I bought it on her behalf. thank you amazon
1,The critics are right -- this movie isn't very good.,"This is a subtle pro-war film that has nothing to do with Christmas. I can't believe Irving Berlin himself liked it. There are only a few things that make it worth watching. (1) Grady Sutton, who doesn't get nearly enough lines or screen time; (2) the quartet singing ""Snow"" in the dining car of the train; (3) the outfit Rosemary Clooney is wearing when she gets on the train as she ""runs"" away from Bing Crosby; and (4) Bing Crosby's apparent self-consciousness as he is undressing in front of Danny Kaye while being talked into following the girls (watch for it -- he hurriedly pulls his shirt down so the camera won't reveal the fact that he's wearing briefs!!!). Aside from all that, a real depressing movie."
2,It's a Wonderful Life,"A Christmas classic. All these years later, life can still be the same as in this movie. Lot's of us are always striving, longing for a ""better"" more exciting life and many times if we stepped back and looked at ours it couldn't get any better, we just need to appreciate what we have and make the best of our life."
2,good movie,"Loved the movie I haden't see it for at least 20 years and it still managed to entertain and delite me, a must see for all ages."
1,"DULL, SLOW AND DULL",Good premise but slow snail pace slow and dull. The acting is stiff and uncomfortable. The story line could have been interesting if they had decided it was a comedy or drama.I know black men dating white women is accepted but white men dating black women is still taboo so the movie had potential but it just doesn't make any magic happen. The two leads don't even act as if they are comfortable with each other. Donald Fasion was the comic relief and he was good...but he was the only good thing about this movie. Rent it don't buy it.
2,Perfect.,"This movie was WITTY, HILARIOUS, SEXY, and just WELL *DONE*!After seeing terrible movies like Beauty Shop which shamelessly and hypocritically use and abuse racial stereotypes, I was apprehensive about seeing a movie about interracial dating....I was so *more* than pleasantly surprised with ""Something New.""Sanaa Lathan hits the comedic notes perfectly and Simon Baker is a refreshing (and beautiful) face on the screen. Though it follows the general formula of any romance comedy, it definitely has a unique edge. I enjoyed every moment and was sad to see the movie end.DEFINITELY SEE IT!"
2,Pretty good starter set,"Like several posters have mentioned, these are a great, inexpensive, stylish set.I give it 4/5 because the steak knives are not one piece knives."
1,"I thought kitchenaid was a good name,was I wrong",I just recieved my knife set 4 days ago.Last night a knife was left in the sink and it rusted.What is up with that.I would recommend not getting this product.The knife set I had at $60.00 never rusted in the 10 years I had them.Shame on you kitchenaid for selling bad products.
1,Tailgate Grill - FAIL!!!,"I will open with the expected ""DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"". I ordered this grill for the first weekend of college football. The weather outside was nice, low 60's, light wind, sunny. I set the grill up with a new full 16 oz. Coleman propane tank. After setting (and keeping) the grill to high, it took multiple attempts to keep the grill lit, despite the low wind. After 20 minutes the grill was still not hot, but I put on my 1/4 lb hamburger patties. After mulitple attempts to keep the grill protected from any breeze, including putting the grill in the trunk of the car (do not try this at home), I pulled my burgers off after AN HOUR AND A HALF (1.5 hours). Despite this amount of time on the ""grill"" the meat was still raw and I went through an entire canister of propane. There was nothing else I could do to help this grill cook, short of breathing on it. Spend the extra money for a better grill!"
1,There is a useful part,"Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially, if you have 1 week to do 2 weeks work you will produce buggy code.To avoid deadline stress like this he recommends a system for estimating work that consists of estimating what it would take if you could write it off the top of your head and giving it a factor from 0 to 5? for how unaquainted with the component techniques you are. Then raise your intitial estimate to this power to get your estimate for how long you will take for this task.However, I agree with all the other criticisms.2 stars. Not absolutely aweful but I could write better."
1,QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS,"I recently purchased the Maxxima 2 LED Night Light with White Lens (Pack of 2), and unfortunately I had the same quality control problem which several other customers have highlighted in their reviews of this product. The night lights are quite bright (which I wanted) and the soft white shades provide a nice quality of lighting. HOWEVER, the first time I plugged one in to the outlet, there was a flash and the smell of smoke - the night light shorted out and was dead. The second nightlight worked properly, but a 50% faulty rate is unacceptable. I also would agree with the other customers who commented that the ""High"" and ""Low"" illumination settings are not very different, the ""Low"" setting should be much dimmer than it is. Until the quality control issues are resolved, I would not recommend purchase of this item."
2,Human Resource Management,The book was in great condition and the delivery was timely. I am completely satisified.
2,This game is soooooo AWESOME!!!!!!!,"I got this game for christmas. It was actually the only computer game I got for christmas. What I like to do is mix dif herbivores in the same exhibit (e.g. Savannah herbivores together). You get higher ratings from the guests if you do it that way. Another game I recommend is The Hobbit. Except you fight the animals instead of taking care of them. All in all, this is a terrific game!"
2,Springfield 13 Inch Thermometer,Nice and easy to read from a distance. Very lightweight. It does what it is advertised to do.
2,Like the Springfield Thermometer,"We've only been using it for a few weeks at a school but it seems like it's pretty close to the correct temperature that another thermometer I have reads. I like how it has the humidity so you can figure out the ""feels like"" temperature and having the wind chill reading is good too."
1,Buy a mercury Thermo for accuracy ...,"This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to 120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate."
1,Lame,"I really hate when a writer true to write a military based book with little to no research, he couldn't even get the ranks right."
1,Not very complete. Too many ActiveX controls missing.,Don't believe the book's cover. The reference is not even a quarter complete. Many ActiveX controls are missing. Where are the references for the database? Why include Usercontrol references in the book when even the Winsock control is not covered? The source code examples in the CD are next to useless. Why call this book the #1 Definitive Master reference???? I want my money back.
2,malts for my son,Just the right mallets at a good price. Could not find any locally so Amazon was the next best place to easily find them.
2,Reflective Tape,The product seems to work as suggested! I received it on time and I'm very happy with it's application.Thankschris
2,Safety first... and second...,Great product. Used it to make a few things just a bit more safe as well as to cover faux chrome making it not only black but reflective as well.
1,It just wouldn't run,"My hw is overkill for the game. It seemed to install just fine. And then it just wouldn't run. Click on the icon and nothing happened. There was no help anywhere for it. I checked all the ""fixes"" online and nothing worked. I've worked for VAR's troubleshooting PC's for a living and I couldn't get it to run. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
1,Don't bother unless you prefer single player,"If you enjoy single player only, then it's a great game.However if you intended to play multiplayer, don't bother.The server has been down repeatedly. The game gives you ""xp"" , or experience points, which decides which level Home City you have.At this point in time, if you're one of the lucky ones, you will receive the xp you have earned, most of us however, haven't received our xp.Under the chat browser, there are chat rooms listed that promise ways to fix the xp problem, however the ES people then say there is no way to fix them, yet they leave the chat rooms so people remain confused.There are only a few hundred people average on the server, the most it's hit is probably 1,110, while early morning US hours, there are usually around 30-40 people...If ES can't handle so few people, what are they going to do when more people try to join?"
1,Bad graphics,"I still play AOE 1 because the graphics are so simple it doesnt hert your eyes to play it for hours. I didnt like the graphics in AOE 2, and after reading all these reviews I dont think i will buy AOE 3. I advise AOE team to make it simple, but fun. (for example dont use green but light brown in the background"
1,Age of Empires III,"We were never able to use the game, because it is not compatible with most computers. check your computer specification before buy it."
1,Not ready for prime time,"I have a 4 GHz machine with 2 Mb of RAM and GeForce4 graphics card. I have no difficulty running lots of games at high resolution. But this game runs so slowly that it is unplayable -- even at the default screen resolution (1024x800).That resolution is another problem. I have a 21"" plasma monitor so anything less than 1600x1200 resolution is blurry. When I tried to use 1600x1200 it was so slow that I thought it had crashed.In addition the screen scrolling is almost impossible to use because it is so jerky and delayed."
1,Age of Empires III,I can not get it to work on my windows XP or Windows 7 machines. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
1,Just a big let down,"I've loved AOE since the first installment and had been looking forward to AOE 3 for years. Unfortunately it turns out to be a huge dissapointment. Everyone else has mentioned the bugs and ridiculous system requirements to get the game working properly but these aside, the gameplay is just truly awful. I AOE 2, you could build a large, realistic looking and balanced army, in AOE 3 its just a rabble of very similar units that are impossible to organise. The maps are too small, the explorer unit is just plain pointless, resource gathering is not what it used to be and the trading posts are annoying to say the least. The main strength of AOE 2 was that it was open to multiple different types of play, from rushers, to stay at home economy builders, but in AOE 3 you have one set way to play and if you don't do it you lose.Overall, although not quite as much of a let down as Championship Manager 5, I'd strongly advise you steer well clear of this."
2,Great small space BBQ!,"This grill is great for small spaces. We live in a condo in NYC and it is perfect for the tiny area we get to call our ""patio"". We love to grill and this gives us delicious dinners without taking up cruical square footage. Very even heat, easy, user-friendly design. I highly suggest it!"
2,Long term winner!,"I have just sold my Patio Caddy after 10 YEARS! I worked famously during that entire time and it still works as good as it did when it was new. The electronic ignition never failed to work. And CharBroil still sells them. Does that tell you something? We only sold it because we wanted a larger unit, no other reason. Get one - you won't be sorry."
2,Can't live without it!,"I've owned the same Patio Caddie for over 10 years now! It grills beautifully over clay briquettes, giving that great smoke flavor and does it all on a fraction of the propane. The key to getting lots of heat from a tiny burner is cooking COVERED. I even bought a kit to retrofit the burner plate and made the old grill like new again for $20!It's a small grill, but will cook six large steaks all at once."
2,IGBY- the european version,"The soundtrack album is actualy a european version where the music in the movie is slightly different. It's an excellent compilation including Travis`version of ""the weight"" and europe's most recent rock breakout ""underwater circus""! Higly recommendable."
2,Windows 98 Annoyances,"This is the first ""Tech manual"" that I have read from cover to cover. It is jammed packed with helpful hints and fixes for Windows 98. Whenever the people at work have a question about Windows 98 we delve into Windows 98 Annoyances and lo-and-behold there is the answer. I have also recommended it to the ZDU SmartPlanet Class I am currently enrolled in. Windows 98 Installation and Support Part I. This book is a must for the beginner and even the intermediate Windows user."
1,The Dutiful Rake,"Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star review is way off. I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this."
2,Good Choice of Episodes,"I would love to see this whole series on DVD, but was happy to get just this small amount on one DVD. I watched some Welcome Back Kotter episodes as a kid and even now, as an adult, I think they are just hysterical. Great fun for a small amount of money!"
2,Flour,"The flour was good, but because of the weight (50 lbs) they could have done a better job in taping the box shut. The box was banged up a bit, only one strip of tape was used."
2,House version of Prince,"Jamie is one of the best house artist short of Larry Heard,Joe Smooth ( Joe Welborn )lil louis,Farly,and all the other house artist out of Chicago. This album should have gotten more air play but the company didn't promote it like they should have.I wish he would make another one."
2,very good debut,This is a very relaxed but also danceable soul album. Jamie has a wonderful smooth voice. He is accompanied by Kym Sims and Chantay Savage on this album. It's a very good and smooth album
1,Bad Mug,"I got this and loved the ergonomics. Great feel, size and balance. I was bitterly disappointed that after one cycle in the dishwasher, the top malfunctioned. The mug has a twisting/locking sealing mechanism and the heat from the dishwasher must have expanded it. Now it will not pour at all. Please note, this was not a 'special cycle' or high temp wash, just normal dishwasher and the thing is ruined. I also ruined a pair of pants yesterday when I couldn't figure out why I could not sip and them coffee came running out the side.My only saving grace is that I figured this out before I went and bought more. BAD PRODUCT DO NOT BUY"
2,Rare and curious relic,"Spade Cooley was not your typical B Western ""hero"". The cowboy movies where he played the lead character seemed like a parody or even a satirical commentary (intentionally or not) on B singing cowboys of that period. This Alpha DVD contains two of his rare three movies where he played lead. Alpha obtained somewhat passable to good copies of prints and released these in DVD. Despite all, Cooley can sing and his western songs have the bounce that Autry's or Rogers' do not have. Unlike the two, Cooley's personal life took a tumble later in his carrer when he was convicted of killing his wife. You'd never expect it from the soft spoken cowboy hero you see on the screen."
1,Spade digs a hole,"This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this."
1,very disapointed,"I realize that this isn't an expensive item by any means, but I guess I expected something more. It didn't give me what I was looking for, which was close-ups of countries, with cities listed. The closer I went in, the fewer pixels there were, making everthing blurry. Maybe I was expecting too much ..."
2,"***** You want to be MCSE, buy it now with Core In Nutshell","This book is not for the beginner to start learning the product. However, if you are just quite familiar with them, this one is the best summarized book. You will find out that there are many things you don't really know, then you go back to try, you will know. Tell you in more detail, I chose TCP/IP and Proxy as my electives. TCP/IP is okay, but Proxy is not that easy, after you read the book, you should try the server again. Anyway, I have to say loudly that I can pass MCSE in 2 weeks because of this ELEPHANT book and its companion Core In Nutshell. Don't forget to buy both of them, Core in Nutshell and Elective in Nutshell. GOOD BOOK DOES NOT NEEDED TO BE THICK. If it's possible, could the writer write MCSD in Nutshell, please?"
2,great introduction and reveiw of topics,"At this point I have only read the TCP/IP and IIS 4.0 sections, but I found them very helpful giving a good general overview of the topics. I then used CBT courseware for more detailed information. A couple of hours before a taking a test I also reveiwed by reading through the specific test section. The section in TCP/IP on subnet masking was the best explanation I have ever read, with instruction for creating and understanding the subnetting chart fantastic, making it easy to create and then answer subnetting questions accurately on the tcp/ip test. The book does not get five stars, because it can only supplement other study material."
2,blast from the past,Uncertain at first but just wanted see how it went. For those who know the Grand Canyon must be fascinating. I would think it a must-have for those exploring this area.
2,Hey,"Hey, Its Zane Grey,what can you say. No matter how much alike they are,Zane Grey always produces interesting reading. Lots of lessons to be learned."
2,20 minutes to warm up your day!,"This is a great warm-up or a mini work out!Breathwork is a focus throughout, while upper and lower body are being worked at the same time, bringing balance to mind, body, and spirit.Whenever I am not feelng motivated I can pop in Zen Yoga Daily Warm-Up DVD, move along with Aaron's instruction, and I am ready to go!"
1,"Great Initially, major fail after time passes...",We first got this grill 3 years ago (may 08). At the time the legs were stable the cooking temp could reach 500-600 without difficulty. By the next summer the legs started getting weak. The liner under the lid needed constant cleaning and most importantly the temp would barely break 450. Then last summer came along and the grill just refused to get hot. I took apart the heating element and was aghast at what I saw. The entire encasement was one big blob of plastic. The whole thing was melted to pieces. You would think the designers wouldn't use plastic so close to the heat! I will not buy a replacement part or buy a new grill until I hear that charbroil has addressed these issues.
1,2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!,"Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills."
1,"Electric is nice, but some major problems","I've had two of these grills. The first I replaced because it was starting to rust (despite being covered) -- I had no major problems with that one, the second I've only had for six months. The second grill has melted around the heating element, which seems to be a fire hazard. I was quite suprised.In addition, the thermostats on these grills have gotten worse than with the original model -- it seems at least 100 degrees off. The fire safety, not including the briquettes and a jacked up price should probably make one look for other options, if only there were other quality options."
1,Does not sear steaks,This grill will work only as a baker and not as a hot grill that will sear steaks. It preheats after 30 minutes to about 375 degrees and the temperature drops significantly when meat is added. This is certainly not the temperature published in the manual. It is not satisfactory for my needs.
2,the best grill that i own,I own three bbq grills .A propane grillcharcol grill and the electric patio caddie.The patio caddie which I use on my deck has forced the other two grills into storage.The electric grill heats up to about 700 degrees in 15 to 20 minutes and cooks burgers in 10 minutes franks in 8 minutes and chicken in about 18 minutes.It is easy to assemble and use.It is by far the best piece of hardware that I have ever bbq'ed on.ps. I intend to use this grill throughout the winter for tailgate parties at home.
1,Total Waste Of My Money,"When new, this grill did not get hot enough to sear the juices into the meat, which is what a good grill will do. Also, there was very little smoke flavor imparted to the meat. It was like grilling in the kitchen stove.The heating element failed after one season, so I invested in a new controller. The new unit worked once, and then failed completely. I have had cheaper electric grills that worked much better and lasted much longer.I do not recommend."
1,DON'T BUY,"I've had this grill for a little over a year. I paid $189 for it. It worked like a champ for ONE SUMMER, now the controller is bad. Char-Broil tells me that it'll cost $90 to replace. Although I like the features of an elctric grill, fast heat and all, if you make such a CRAPPY unit that it doesn't last long and you don't stand behind it...I say I'll NEVER buy another Char Broil product again!"
1,lousy design...,"I am now on my 3rd Char-Broil patio caddie! They've each lasted 2 years and then the plastic control knob melts! What kind of design do they have? Then again, I guess I need to stop ordering the grill, thinking they've improved the design. WHY would any engineer place a PLASTIC KNOB anywhere near 400-500 degree metal???? WHY??? I like the look of the new stainless steel version, but WILL NOT buy another until they design a control knob that won't melt!!! PLASTIC on HOT metal???? C'mon Char-Broil....get with the program and TEST your own grills!Don't buy if you're expecting this grill to last more than a couple of seasons.Also, a HINGED LID would be a real bonus, too!"
1,Awkward start,"Ocean Colour Scene are absolutely brilliant. It is amazing to me that they are virtually unknown here in the States. They write, sing and play beautifully. They are always well produced but never over produced. This however is unlike anything else they have released. It is an awkward beginning at best. The songs show promise and that promise was realized in their subsequent releases. Where the performances are solid, the production sinks the recording. It is dated, slick and just a poor fit for the band's sound. If you must have them all, you will end up buying this. Otherwise, get any of the other releases they are far superior and all terrific. This is just not an essential recording."
2,Great compressor!,"This is a great compressor, it has pently of power to drive brads and finish nails."
2,Great music performed extraordinarily well,"My introducation to the music of Dmitri Kabalewsky was through the old Horowitz recordings of the 3rd sonata (both live and studio version) and some of the preludes. The music here is not as phantasmagoric as Scriabin, not as lush as Rachmaninov, and certainly not as ""modern"" as Prokofiev. Yet Kabalewsky is very original and falls within the Romantic range of Russian pianism. His music evokes various moods that might remind one of Prokofiev but there also seems to be an element of the fantasy there as well, especially in the preludes. The Sonatas are tight pieces well worth frequent performances on today's concert stage. The pianist, Wolfram Schmitt-Leonardy, is excellent with this music and plays it to the hilt. The sound and recording quality is very good as well. In all, a worth while CD for pianophiles looking for something new and good."
2,Hot stuff -- an inspiration for writers!,"This is an excellent book about a man who knows who he is, dreams of what he might be, and works his butt off to make the near-impossible real.It's a great book for struggling writers to read because Larry Brown came from nowhere to become one of the great writers of his generation and he did it on the strength of his will alone.There are passages in this book so lovely they make you catch your breath."
1,Disappointing,"This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking ""This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen."", before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience."
2,Reading ON FIRE not a waste of time,"ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was."
2,Landscape of the Heart,"WINTER PASSING is visually beautiful with skillful acting and slow-paced story telling. The lives portrayed are barren as a winter landscape, rife with drug and alcohol abuse, casual sex, self-injury, suicide attempted and suicide succeeded...in their attempts to block out lonliness and disappointment.These lives are groping towards meaning and find it in the search for a redefinition of family, after Reese's rocky homecoming leads to a measure of reunion and reconciliation.The ending is a bit too neat after the messiness we've been privy to. But, the film is worth watching and considering for it's complex interactions among the four characters in the Michigan scenes as they search for some new way, any way, out of a hard winter's landscape.--Janet Grace Riehl, author Sightlines: A Poet's Diary"
2,Uplifting and Inspirational!,I purchased the CD as a means of introduction for our kids to christian music. The worship songs are upbeat and spiritually uplifting. Its a fantastic CD and I recommended it highly. It would make a great addition to your current musical collection and an even better gift to a friend. I love it!
2,SIRIUS - SIGNAL KIT,I had problems with indoor receptions with Sirius boom box external antenna so I bought this. It works very well so now I have excellent reception indoors. I installed it with the splitter for standard Satellite not HD and it works well this way I don't know how well it would affect HD reception for the TV if at all. I am very pleased with this unit.
2,This is the best book in the world,"Mr. Poppers Penguin is the best book. The author is Richard and Florence Atwater. This is a Newbery Honor book. It is great for all ages because it is the funniest book in the world. My favorite part is when the penguins live in the freezer. The characters are Mr. Popper, Mrs. Popper, Admiral Drake, Mr. Greenbaum, Mr. Klein, Janie Popper and Bill Popper. The Penguins are Caption Cook, Greta, Columbus, Victoria, Nelson, Jenny, Magellan, Scott, Isabella, Ferdinand and Louisa. Hope you read this book."
2,Wonderful Book,"I took a University class were The Story of Judaism, third,augmented edtion, by Bernard J. Bamberger was used as the textbook. The book was well orginized, enjoyable to read, and very comprehensive. It added a large amount of historical facts to my religous knowledge. It was well recieved by both the Jewish and non-Jewish students."
2,What can I say?,"This was a GREAT find. First bought the vinyl back in the 80's and snagged the disc quite some time ago. Ray signed the cover in 2002 @ the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio"
2,Sturdy grater,"This product took a while coming, but it is completely satisfactory. Heavier than most drum graters, it offers the possibility of a longer life."
1,"When in trouble, break glass","First off, if you are going to write this genre, then recognize that there are people out there who know weapons, know the law and know unarmed combat. This books fails in all of those details.It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the ""evil"" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.This plot was terribly predictable."
1,Disappointing,"I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful. It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character. The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the ""hero"" of this novel was supposed to be. To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead."
2,BEST CD I BOUGHT ALL YEAR!,"The review that prompted me to buy this CD called it ""an embarassment of riches"" and it is an understatement.Every song is a joy. During the first listen I waited eagerly when the changer switched to the next tune. You never know what is going to greet you next. Big band, salsa, gorgeous ballads. They are all here. With a voice that can be soft and beguiling one minute and powerhouse the next, I was completed shocked that I'd never heard of this singer. The arrangements are so rich you'd expect to hear these musicians backing Streisand or Eder. And the extra surprise of getting a duet with Susan Egan (I'm a big fan), with both of them belting out their gospel best. Why has this woman not yet been on Broadway?This was my first listen to Lisa Richard, and I will go back now and buy every recording she has ever made."
1,worth product i never got from Amazon website before,"i ordered this book on june 14, i didn't get the item till amonth later. The shipping suck. finally, i got the book after my school already start, it was too late for my class. It's totally bad quality differ from what the seller detail. Bad Service, bad product. never buy anything from the seller again."
2,perfect,"Perfect on my Sony blu-ray, 4 year old daughter enjoys it, probably just buy it considering the price to rent it..."
2,Lauras Review!! GO ME,"well...I havent seen this movie in a while but its one of my favourite movies of all time...Its great! The songs are amazing, the graphics are remarkable and the whole movie is perfection. Tim Burton is a Genious!! I love this movie...I had it when i was little and I watched it all the time...Thats why I want the DVD"
2,Classic Tim Burton,"What can I say, but BRAVO! A stop-motion picture of this calibur will NEVER be topped. Definitely an inventive way of visualizing holidays. Tim Burtons visions artistically come to life in this dark christmas tale. Great Job!"
2,Nightmare before Christmas,"Tim Burton does it again! I don't know why it is listed as a Christmas movie, I would think more of a Halloween movie, could be both I suppose. Awesome!!!"
2,My favorite movie,"This is a great movie with incredible stop motion animation. The story is fantastic, my kids love it, they watch it all the time"
1,nightmare before christmas,"Let me start by saying it took over 5 weeks to deliver, upon delivery my Granddaughter was extremly overjoyed. Until i tried to play the dvd, come to find out the movie will not play in the U.S.A. Not only is my Granddaughter upset i am realy pissed, This purchase was a waste of money and time."
2,Very Happy with purchase.,The item was the same as what it was described as. Great value for the money with the Special Edition!
2,"Twisted, different, fun","Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" such a treat. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween. He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever. Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday. Definitely for more mature children only."
2,Great movie great condition,Movie arrived before estimated day and is in great shape for being used. Will use this company for my dvd needs in the future.
2,A charming Mexican Romantic Comedy,Anyone who has any familarity with Mexican culture will immediately identify with this movie. The son who does his mother's bidding no matter what. The young woman who marries to escape the constrictions of the family. The closeted nature of gay life in Mexico. The mother who works to make sure her son is happy as well as presents the proper appearance in society. Someone from the United States might wonder what all the fuss is about. But the movie touches on the Mexican world view and gay people in a compassionate manner for the time. A good training manual for any gringo who decides to involve himself with a Mexican male.
1,Terrible product quality and service,"Ordered a 2 pack, only received a single pillow...which upon being filled the first time, found it leaked terribly. Best I could get was a 1/2 refund for the one that never arrived since the leaking pillow was ""used"". So much for consumer protection and refunds for defective products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company, especially this product, unless you want to lose your money. You'd have better odds at Vegas getting your money back."
2,"So far, happy","The only flaw is that it is HEAVY and cold on the bottom. Otherwise, I seem to be sleeping pretty well with it. No leaking problems as others stated."
1,Imac Crap,This book is useless. Anyone with 10 minutes may sit at an Apple computer and learn more hands on than the hour or two wasted reading this book. The other reviews here re: iMac Fast and Easy are very misleading... probably written by someone with interests other than yours.
1,Yuck!,"a spaghetti western at its worst. Mistook the film for the new Django and what a mistake it was. Thankfully, it was only a rental. Never bothered beyond the first ten minutes."
1,A Mess,"I have read this book cover to cover (with my highlighter and pencil at the ready) and I've never been more frustrated in all my life. I work with Word everyday and am looking to automate documents and I can make no sense out of any of it. (Of course, there is a strong possibility that I'm stupid and in over my head - but if you think you're going to learn to create templates and fill-in forms and learn to use If-then-else fields, etc., well, I missed it.)"
1,It was alright...,"While listening to Sleepy Brown's album, I was amped to hear some smooth groves and soul. I was pondering on whether I would buy it while I bobbed my head to the music video for ""Margarita"" because I liked that song a lot. But while I listened to the album, I noticed that it remained even throughout. There was never a bad song or a really great song. It was at a steady pace the entire time, sort of like listening to Sade or someone of that nature. When ""Underwater Love"" came on, I was pleasantly surprised that he did have one head bobber that made me want to dance, but other than that, the album was at a medium pace. I don't love it. I don't hate it. I'm just indifferent about it. I would replay ""Underwater Love"" in heavy rotation, but I'm not sure I'll buy it."
1,didn't work for me,"used about 3 of these over a two year period, although in partly shaded places, and never caught any YJs. The reusable rescue trap(which I guess i am having trouble finding in stores now) worked fairly well. I did use water as per instructions, however. did not try the apple juice thing.Guess people don't find this review helpful, that is OK. There might be regional differences or other poorly understood factors. Just my experience with the product. The YJ problem is so bad around our property(especially after mild winter) got stung several times this year and personally destroyed 2 underground nests, yet they are still around. Have heard they can forage for a quarter of a mile away. We live in one of the Gulf Coast states and maybe that is a factor. Maybe our YJs are smarter than the ones in other places, who knows. I have to try this again but will use apple juice mixture this time."
1,Terrible,"How did this product even get 1 good review? Terrible, sat right next to a whole swarm practically that was coming to my pool to drink water every day. After 7 days, it caught NOTHING. Took it down and tossed in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed."
1,Don't catch Yellow Jackets,Their old attractant caught TONS of yellow jackets so I am experienced with this trap. The white attractant has not caught anything except a few flies and crickets. The company is great however and has agreed to work with me if I continue to be dis-satisfied. I am giving it one more try and using apple juice this time instead of water.
2,Always works,I am big fan of Irwin Naturals Ginkgo and been using it for years. My wife uses a lot of there brands as well.
1,Not a good everyday supplement,"I rated this item one star since I had bad experience with taking it and withdrawal effects.The Ginko part is great, but it has L-Dopa which is precursor to dopamine , a major neurotransmitter in the brain. taking this supplement regularly will make you sleepy and if you stop it suddenly will cause depression symptoms.Please read more about the supplements content before buying any."
1,ugh!,The plot is corny and unrealistic. The characters couldn't be more transparent if they were glass. Definitely a waste of time...unless you want to get a few good laughs at the author's unintentionally humorous style.
1,no,I didn't like this book because it was as true to life as advertised on the back of the book. I think agent Night's character should learn to talk like a real person.
2,Lust for Danger blew me away!,"I was thrilled with this book! My only regret was that it ended. Fast-paced, exciting, human characters...visual...great dialogue, exotic and well researched locations...I can't say enough! I hope there are more Agent Night adventures in store for us. It was so refreshing to read Lust for Danger, definitely brought my appetite back for a good story!"
2,Top notch movie,"Have enjoyed this movie for years. Don`t know why I had not bought it before.The Sweeny Todd performance is the greatest.Sure beats ""Memories"" from Cats."
1,Pretty Lame,"I thought this movie was pretty bad. It was SO easy to predict. Liv Tyler's role was so small, I think she is a lovely actress, who made a bad choice to work in such a cheesy movie.Ben Affleck may be fabulous eye candy, but I must say, his acting abilities are lacking substance.Overall, I would skip this one all together. Even as a rental."
1,"Good story idea, but carried out in a bad way","The basic idea of this story is good: a father learning how to raise his daughter while also trying to cope with the loss of his wife and the fact that his daughter's birth caused his wife's death. What could have been great was botched, however. There was too much profanity. I find it in very bad taste to use profanity in front of children. I also found there to be too much sex in the movie. They could have developed the plot without that. I did like the Will Smith side jokes in there, however."
1,Garbage,"Poor acting all around, Horrible storyline. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. You'll thank me."
2,I don't care I enjoyed this movie!,"Being a father and also being a Kevin SMith fan, this movie was easy to connect with, I also have a daughter and a big ambition to make movies, it is also something that gets in the way of being a dad. A great movie."
2,Extra Questions for the Test!,This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series.
2,I'm learning a lot!!,"I really didn't even use the cd's for two weeks, just the book and it's been marvelous. My boyfriend is Hispanic and I felt the need to be able to at least recognize a few words of Spanish. Once I started to use the cd's everything came so quickly. Como se dice FANTASTIC in espanol!!!!"
1,This is a waste of money,"This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it, and the CDs fall out. The CDs are clearly just made in a CD burner.What's worse is the content. You will NOT learn Spanish through this program. I studied Spanish in college, and I know this is nowhere near a complete course. It doesn't bother teaching the past tense! You learn just the present tense and a tiny, tiny bit of the future tense.The Spanish speaker is excellent, I must say, but the English speaker [...]will put you to sleep. He reads like a robot: ""O...K...Luis....now...we...will...dis...cuss...the ..numbers...in...span...ish."" BORING! Nothing is tied together--it's just a bunch of random commentary thrown out at you.I'm sure there are much better courses available."
1,[aweful],"This is probably the most ill-formed book in general I have ever read, not to mention the worst grow book, period. The illustrations are CHEESY.The photographs are of poor quality, you can barely discern them. The information is general, contradictory, unorganized... I wouln't trust a thing in it, which is strange because Jorge Cervantes is a genius, and his previous publications prove his skill. But this book is a no-no. Go for another, and don't be afraid to spend the bucks. You want climate matched with plant variety with specific feeding instructions, and plenty of do's and dont's. If your info is poor then your fruit will suffer."
2,"Nice, well built darts","I got these after my less than stellar experience with the Viper Black Mariah's. These throw better, feel better and are built much better. Overall it was a wiser investment for a casual dart player like myself."
1,Dreadful,"Bought this item based on the positive reviews. I bought 3 and followed the directions. Not only did this trap not catch any flies, the smell was dreadful. At first we thought we had a dead mouse in the wall. The smell is that bad. We threw them out. This trap was a waste of money and time."
1,"Works well, but the smell is intolerable","I put one in the garage and another by the trash cans. Over 1 weeks they both collected about 20 flies each, but the smell was so bad I had to remove them from any where around the house, I now have them in the back of the yard where they continue to work, but the flys are still getting in the house... too bad!"
2,These are great fly traps!,"THis is the second order of these fly traps. We tried a locally available fly trap after the first order was completely full of flies but the other brand just didn't do the job so we reordered these to use in our horse barn. These are WONDERFUL. Within minutes of hanging them, the flies started collecting. We hang them just over head level at each of the entrances to the barn and the arena and they do a superb job of ridding the barn of pesky flys that annoy our stallions."
2,Highly Recommend,"This fly trap really works well. I hung the fly trap in our cherry blossom tree which is located close to our trash cans and our huge pigeon cage. This time of year the Cherry Blossom tree is dropping cherries and with the high temp heat, they almost splatter when they hit the ground...the flies love this...plus we have a dog. So needless to say we have flies everywhere and I hate them. The flytrap has been hanging for two weeks and there are hundreds of flies in this thing. Especially during the hot afternoon it is swarming with flies, I have noticed a significant difference in the number of flies. They used to be all over the grass, all over the trash cans, The fly trap has made a big difference. Don't get me wrong we still have flies...but not like before. Every couple of days you have to make sure to check your trap to see if you need to add water to it, so the water stays at the fill line. I ended up buying this flytrap at Lowes."
1,"Either I've attracted Highly Evolved Flies, or this is 100% Rubbish",Are there a lot of flies near this? Yes.Have practically any flies been caught by this stupifyingly piece of useless rubbish? No.Review complete.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"We had a cook out in our back yard and we hung this up on the deck about 5 feet away from the table and not one fly went for this thing as they were all in our food!! As soon as we cleared the food from the table, then they went for this trap so this did not work for the intentions that I bought it for, which was so the flies to stay away from our food!"
2,Fly control,"This thing is amazing, I got one after seeing it in action at a friends house. WARNING Be sure not to spill any of the contents what so ever, mine fell off the tree I had it up in and months later I still smell the bait in that area and it smells like death."
2,The one that Works,"I purchased this product last Fall on a close out sale at a huge national retailer. It worked perfectly. This year I returned to the same retailer in July and they had sold out of the Rescue Brand Fly Traps and didn't plan on restocking until next year. They talked me into purchasing another brand. Needless to say the other brand didn't work. We live next to a cattle pasture and the flies are outrageous near our home. I hung the ""other"" brand fly trap on the fence between the pasture and my driveway and a week later there were a few flies in the trap. I ordered the Rescue Brand Fly Trap from Amazon and hung 3 of them on the same fence. 3 days later I had to replace the Rescue Brand TrapsRESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trapbecause they were FULL OF FLIES. I will not use another brand trap because I am not a wealthy person and cannot waste money. The Rescue brand Fly is the one that works. Don't waste your time or money with any other brand."
1,First 3 songs good then...a little disapoointing,"When I head ""Shining Light"" I thought this was going to be real find. When I bought this CD, I was let down a little. The first things (including Shining Light) are very catchy and good. But, from then on, the CD just goes into gradual mediocrity. Oh well, I guess I still think Shining Light is a great song with great words."
1,OUTRAGEOUS price!,"Why are they so expensive here? At least twice the price that they normally are at a drugstore! I love Amazon, but it drives me crazy when they jack the price up on random items. I thought I was supposed to get a the best price here."
2,One of the best entertainment book,"I have read many, many books on Hollywood and auto/biographies in general and this book ranks as one of the best ever. It is a very entertaining book that doubles as a great history of Hollywood through its golden age. Capra interacted with Hollywood's legends and reports in a funny, candid and emotional way his dealings with the likes of Harry Cohn, Sinatra, Disney, Monroe and many more stars of the thirties and forties. Do not think the book is dated: yes, some of the names are meaningless to us today but the perspetive and lessons contained in every single page are timeless. this book tells you better than any others how movies are made or should be made..."
2,ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF THE 90'S!,"THIS IS BY FAR MIKE MYER'S BEST MOVIE! DANA CARVEY AND MYERS LIGHT UP THE SCREEN LIKE NO OTHER COUPLE. THE SCRIPT IS BRILLIANT FUNNY AND COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE. WHAT DO I MEAN? AFTER YOU SEE THIS FILM YOU PICK UP LINES LIKE EXSQUEEZE ME? AND BAKING POWDER? GET IT? ANYWAY, GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT CULT-LIKE SCRIPT! MYERS IS A TRUELY GREAT COMIC. BUY THIS MOVIE, YOU DEFINITELY WON'T REGRET IT!"
2,Squeeze me? Baking Powder?,"If you grew up watching Mike Myers on SNL, you'll appreciate this movie. Not great but funny enough to make you chuckle."
2,AGE3,"I have been a fan of this series from the beginning and it has only gotten better with time and later versions. The latest version takes place in a time period with great significance and has always drawn me in. The graphics are great, as long as your computer is equipped to handle them. I started playing on an older computer which locked up during ship battles and such. However, with a newer comp I enjoy full game play. Maybe there were some bugs in the software initially, but I have never had a problem outside of processor speed. Great game, 5 stars."
1,"There's no commentary, I expected more.","I wanted to know more about what John has to say. But, there's no commentary, only fill in the comments yourself. I can do that with my bible. A good buy but, not what I expected."
2,An apt title for retro-loving film buffs,"This is a great collection of Burlesque shorts. The ""features"" are not entirely worth watching. Every element of the classic grindhouse atmosphere is recorded--the gritty backdrops, the corny comics, the jaded stripteasers, and even some hilarious musicians having trouble keeping their eyes on the instruments!Even if you aren't planning on watching every short in this two-disc set, it is a great purchase anyways. I have even used this as a sort of conversation piece/ambiance in some interesting parties. The interview of Lili St. Cyr in the liner is also well worth reading.Enjoy the lost art form of Burlesque!!!"
1,B at best,I did not make it very far through this movie. Even if you think Jenny is attractive (she's not) then you still shouldn't watch this movie. Thankfully amazon prime gives it to us for free.
1,Dreadfully Unfunny,"This was a movie recommended to me by a friend. I turned it off after seeing a fish imbedded in the lower orifice of one of Jenny's dates. He yells, ""Touch my bass!"" over and over. Need I say more? OK, how about the earlier scene where another of Jenny's dates throws up on her breasts? One of the worst movies of the decade."
2,if u have an off beat sense of humor you'll love it!,In this movie jenny mccarthy stars as rebecca who is dating a typical model who is more in love with himself then her. This movie is not for people who find typical things funny. Everything from her break down on the hollywood strip to finding her boyfriend cheating on her are things that women encounter. I mean the whole part where she goes richard my richard and then starts to cry and then stops calms herself then thinks about the situation again. classic. ive done that although not on the street. and when she walks in on her boyfriend and doesnt say anything my friend did the same thing. everyone has that white ghetto friend. everyone has that ditsy friend. all the stereotypes were done to the extreme and thats what makes it so great and really funny. you cant take this movie seriously and you shouldnt try to. Just enjoy it!
1,terrible,Why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was on the first page of popular picks. It was beyond bad.
1,Aren't there any negative stars?,"This was a total waste of time. Bad acting, worse plot, the most intelligent part is the screams of OMG. Not worth the money that you don't pay for it."
1,pure cra*,"This is the first movie review I have ever provided and I write it only to save any other person out there a bit of your life. Skip this movie, it is the worst I've seen in my life."
2,Do yourself a favor.... BUY IT!!!!!,"I'm owned this cd since it came out and all I can hear is Dave Tregunna kick ass basslines, Andy McCoy's atomic guitar and some major adrenalin ricocheting of off some drummer I never even heard of until I brought this cd.... THE BASSLINES KICKASS ON THIS ALBUM!!!! Dave is a very underated bassist who not only plays very creative basslines but is also able to sing some great backups as well and I needn't say anything about Andy his playin speaks for itself. Billy's voice is fine. So what he doesn't tend to take one direction when he sings. I happen to like that about him. There isn't a bad song on this album. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS CD!"
1,"worth a rent, but that's it","I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the write ups I had read about it. I must admit I was highly disappointed. The acting was good, but it was such a cliche storyline. Repressive husband, wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more. I guess I just didn't think it original. I didn't care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast."
1,Poor anti-war movie,"I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since ""Mosquito Coast"" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals."
2,Pretty Good,"I have the Night Before Halloween so I decided to give this book a try. It starts off very good. It fell off to me toward the middle. But, overall still a very funny and entertaining book."
2,Children loved it!,"We heard about this book and bought it for our grandchildren, they loved it but so did the adults. It is a funny book!"
2,Cute,"I like how this book is realistic yet kid friendly. My 3 yr old can relate to almost every page and it teaches him a few new words like ""needles"" on the tree and ""sugar plum"" to which he always calls out it's candy! And he laughs when the baby pee pees on Santa. He also likes when the girl says ""bad kitty"" because our pets are always knocking down ornaments, too. It is almost creepy how close this comes to depicting our family, my husband even came down with the flu, too. Would recommend this for an evening read-aloud with the kids because it is cute for parents too."
2,Loved it,"Interesting period piece. Well written... this manuscript won an international competition by Wallace publishing (Chicago) as well as a $10,000 prize for it's author, Jeffrey DePrend (Oscar Prendergast) in 1919."
1,bad experience,"I thought i was getting a dvd i could view in the USA!Unfortunately it was for viewing in China!I was told i would have to pay for shipping to send it back,wow. This was from MovieMars,beware"
2,Excellent Read,"I have read this book at least 2 times in the past few months - it is an easy, but very good read that explores lots of concepts and practical steps. Chapter 3 definitely rocks!"
2,First Buy,At least this on played on my dvd unlike S2. Really enjoy this series so glad I purchased the series so I can watch it whenever I want to.
1,Build Your Own Pentium III PC,"As with most of the ""build your own"" books on the market, this one is pretty out of date. Also, the book supplies you with very little information which would help you select which components will best meet your needs and which components work best together (ie- which motherboards, video graphics boards ...). Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book. I think I could have wrote a better book and I do not even consider myself a computer geek.Bottom line, I waisted my money..."
1,Not really that great.,"Bought this and ""Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant""After a week this Jar had about 50 flies in it.The other, had hundreds.Only downside to the bag working so great is its pretty much already full after 2 weeks and I need a new one.Might just dish out the money for a bug zapper."
1,Not as effective as had hoped... and it REEKS!!!!!,"We leave a bowl of food out for our outdoor cats, and it attracts a LOT of flies... this fly trap has helped somewhat, but the results are minimal. The odor from the trap is absolutely horrific and unbearable. If you don't have a bowl of pet food sitting outside, perhaps this trap will work for you (and definitely place it where you won't smell it!)."
1,do not buy,Green top does not hold the weight of the water well.Hung mine and yes the lid was on tight.Next thing it fell from green top and was all on the floor.Green plastic top does not hold weight of water at all.
2,Underrated blues/rock band compels musicianship to new level,"Much in the spirit of Zeppelin, the Badlands take their smart rock and outline a detailed map of musicianship that easily makes todays Limp Bizkit compost creations, a musty meddle of distasteful whiner garbage. When it's said that this CD is hard to find, there is a duel meaning. Finding a copy to own for yourself may be quite a challenge, but more importantly, a CD of this calibur is hard to find in a world where it's cool to regurgitate already virulent ideas. This CD is more than enough to make the group's cover of James Taylor's ""Fire and Rain"" a rock n' roll classic."
2,HILARIOUS,"IF YOU LIKE PHYSICAL HUMOR AND STEVE CARRELL, THIS IS A WINNER. ANNE HATHAWAY IS GREAT AND ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T LIKE THE ORIGINAL SERIES, IT DELIVERS THE LAUGHS. MY TEEN SONS ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY"
1,DIGTAL COPY WILL NOT WORK,"A warning that the Digital Copy disc that comes with this Blu-Ray set will no longer work. It ""expired"" in December 2009 and can no longer be accessed. Just something that should be noted, I think, for anyone buying this Blu-Ray new today.Having purchased it for my son to watch, and wanting to put it on his iPod to do so, was very disappointed that this wasn't known prior to purchase."
2,Funnier than expected,"I was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie. The inclusion of The Rock helped decrease the overall dorkie-ness. Lots of fun and right up there with the Austin Powers movies.The Blu-Ray copy looked AMAZING. I did not see a copy of the regular DVD version so I have no real comparison but that aside, it looked crystal clear."
1,"Ha-Ha, boy, was this funny?","The main problem with this movie: it was'nt that funny. I think I laughed once, maybe twice. Normally, Steve Carell is very funny; but he had nothing to work with here. Terence Stamp, a great actor, is totally wasted in this punishing film as the main villian, Siegfried. Anne Hathaway was completely forgettable as, er, I forget. And someone please tell Alan Arkin to stop sleeping on the set...oh, he was awake? Could of fooled me..One laugh was generated by Bill Murray, playing Agent 13. Besides that, I can't think of much else that made me laugh. This was a comedy? Good points: Nice crisp,clear picture and this was a free rental."
2,Can't be beat,"I don't usually like these kinds of movies. I am more of a Disney fan, but for some reason this one really tripped my trigger. I love how it is relatively clean, and has a fun balance between action, adventure and silliness. I pull it out whenever I need a good laugh."
1,taking stupid to a new hight,"this movie makes the orignal max smart a genius. did not even make it half way through the movie before having too stop watching due to way too much stupidityIf it wern't for Anne Hathaway (t.n.a.) and the Rock. Now I like goofy movies, but this went a little past that point. RENT FIRST before buying. who knows, maybe it will be better the second or third time I try watching this movie"
1,Stupid,"How this movie is getting such good ratings is beyond me.It just goes to show that people will like anything these days.People are such simpletons that I guess doesn't take much to amuse them.This movie is so stupid and no I am not comparing it to the tv show,I never even watched it.This movie was not funny nor did it have a good plot.Maybe I don't get Steve Carrel's humor,I don't know but I'm not gonna waste my time writing a long review for this horrid movie.I think they should stop making tv shows into movies.(Miami Vice,Land Of The Lost)It seems that it doesn't work."
1,Plain old Boring!,"I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's, so I guess I was expecting too much from this film and I actually left the theater about 40 mins. in. It just was not funny. It tried hard with the gadgets, and quips from the TV show, but for me it just didn't connect at all. I'm not being critical, just honest."
2,Delicious!!,I bought this Thai Green Curry paste to cook a Thai dish I'd seen made on of the cooking shows. It turned out PERFECT. I almost make that dish weekly now. Can't live without my Mae Ploy!
2,Spicey,This is real potent. It doesn't take a lot to make it firey. This tub should last a long time
1,A waste of talent,"This movie has an all star cast but is so horrid. It is so funny to watch how horrible the movie is. Do not buy it, please save your money and buy shaft! This movie is so corny it is like you woke up in a comedy of Goodfellas."
2,WOwzeRs,"I'm not usually a rock music person. I saw these guys on the shelf at a music store. so when i got home i downloaded one of the songs. I fell in love. I had to buy it. and so, of course, I did. The vocals on this album are amazing. His voice is so smooth! Well, you HAVE to buy this cd. I am telling you now, you wont be disappointed. My favorites are ""Addicted"" and ""One Day"", but i love them all too. So what are you waiting for!? click the BUY button, get ur credit card and.. and yah, from there do whatever u want.."
1,"Grow some balls, PLEASE!!!","This group is so WEAK I could puke! I am from the Montreal area like these guys, I am really truly embarassed by this band. Their material (I can't use words like art or songs because they don't apply) is so cookie cutter, radio pop, middle of the road friendly BS that I would not waste my time downloading it for free. message to the band: Grow up, I'm sure your all over 21... you have to admit it looks pretty stupid when a full grown adult sounds like an angry 13 year old trying to impress a girl or piss off ""mean old dad"", but I guess good money can make anyone do anything eh guys?There is some really good music out there these days people, AIM HIGHER! avoid this sh*t and go find it."
1,"""I think they lost their balls""","This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks! If you listen to it, stick your extremeities into a blender. NOW."
1,Why are they compared to Good Charlotte?,"They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different, this bands lyrics aren't, its all boring love songs that we've heard a billion frickin times... I gave them 2 stars because I like a few songs but thats all. And you know what, all you people need to stop b****ing over whats ""punk"" and whats ""poser"". Good Charlotte have said themselves their not trying to be punk, so whats the use in arguing?"
1,Punk? yeah right,"Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink 182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!"
2,Best CD Around,"When I got this CD I don't know what I expected, but when I listened to it, I was like WOAH! THIS IS FABULOUS! I really reccommend it to EVERYONE! It has something for all. :P"
2,Rick,I think all of the people who think Simple Plans album sucks can lick my balls because there is not one song that is not good on the Cd. I think simple plan did a great job making the album and everyone who thiks it sucks can lick my ballsack
1,THIS IS COOL,"oh my god I love this band, they are so hot. I love they're punkish hairstyles and the way they dress. The music is awsome. IT's like the coolest cd I own besides Britney spears and good charlotte. The lyrics are like so deep, I almost cry. I'm a teenager too and I know how it feels when your parents yell at you and when you break up with your boyfriend and stuff.Damn my nail broke. Gotta go, American Idol is on. Simple Plan rocks!"
1,STay away from all pop/punk at all costs!,"Now i decided to review this rancid cd, i mean green day cd, o wait is it blink 182? no wait its good charlotte o no its simple plan its all the same though,lol Punk= pop end of story its all the same you want to hear some meaningful music go pick up KoRn's self tituled debut and you can hear Jonathan davis (vocals for KoRn) crying in the background or go buy marilyn manson's antichrist superstar and go listen to the man that you fear now thats real and its not fake! Another person reviewing this garbage said the lyrics were sad?!?!? sad?!??! no pathetic heres pretty much what you get when you listen to this crap o no i wrecked my daddys car boo hoo o no god hates me he lieks to pick on me and i wish i was dead cause lifes to terrible thats bull*hit!!!! but its another band for the preppy popular kids. so sad it really is. It really is."
2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.....","Hey, moron.... it's ""I'M SORRY, i can't be perfect"" not ""daddy, i can't be perfect"".... Nothing else to say, just doing my part in trying to educate the losers of the world."
2,Simple Plan Rocks,"If youre into bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, or Blink 182 then you should definitely get Simple Plan's album. Especialy if you like Blink and Good Charlotte, since some of those guys guest star in this album. Addicted,My Alien, and God Must Hate Me are just a few of the great songs on this album. If you love new punk music then you need to get this album."
1,"Man, this actually sells?????","Now let me tell you right now that i DO like pop-punk(The starting line, Midtown, greenday, Fall out boy). But this is just garbage!!!What qualifies for music these days is just horrible. These guys have NO punk essense whatever. they are just pop. just cause you dye or spike your hair, wear a studden belt and skate shoes deos not make you a punk. these guys target demographic is 11-13 year old girls who think thier life sux cuase a guy deosnt like them. They are just a boy band with guitars. This is as manufactured as mainstream pop garbage."
1,I wrote a poem on this band,"Simple PlanYou say your punkThat is bull $h!tYou sang ""I Don't Want To Think About You""Those Lyrics Connected To Me Cause That Is How I Feel About YouAll Who ANswer No To If This Review Is HelpfulCan Lick My....HandIf You Like ThemThen You Go To School Wearing Abercrombie and Spend Hundreds of Dollars Say Your Punk and The Only Ones That Agree With You Are Your Immature Poser FriendsSnoogans!Love,The JonesIf you agree your kick@$$!"
1,REALLY BAD...,"it's completelly embarassing the posture of the guys from simple plan....they must be 30 years old men, but sings naive lyrics with a complete lack of talent and the songs seems the same...TERRIBLE!!Almost everything on earth is better than this silly product."
2,Simple Plan Rocks,"I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer, Pierre, is so hot! I can't wait for them to come out with a new album. Everyone should own ""No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"""
1,badd,"hprrible punk emo sellouts, try to sound like a band that deserves credit ANBERLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS is What is Wrong with Music of Today,"I don't have much to say but bands like this have no originality. I'm sick and tired of hearing pop punk emo whining bands that all copy off of each other doing the same old crap and making albums complaining about girls and whatever else. I'll admit, I haven't listened to this whole album, but just from the singles and clips I can tell exactly how this is. Come on people! Music is about new sounds and originality, these are the same chords and whiny lyrics we've all heard far too many times. Don't support this trash."
1,Well..,"Well, I have listened to parts of this album, it's not very good. I just wanted to review because I wanted to be cool and bash a band like the ""punk"" fans on here. I want to fit in too :("
1,Sucks,"See my review of their live cd.And god, go easy on the caps lock, you poser punk band loving psycho."
1,No balls... no helmets... just pads!,"Maxi pads that is! I saw a poster of these posers, and they tried to rip off the Casualties. In this Casualties poster I have, the band is standing all pissed off in a junk yard, in the Simple Rip-Off, they stood tryin to look cool in an abandoned lot(i bet they had security to protect their rich boy asses!) I hate posers, and i am tired of rippin off the Casualties and other true punk bands. 0 stars please!!!"
1,*yawn*,"It's obvious that Simple Plan is primarily aiming for the younger teens with this. At least I hope they are. The lead singer is not very good, and his voice may grate on your nerves. People bash Avril because they say she is a poser. Avril's never said she's putting out punk music. These guys believe they're punk....they aren't. Still, if you like sugar-coated, trl/radio friendly pop...with the tiniest breath of punk in it, then by all means, you can't go wrong here. If you want real punk rock, go with AFI. I would also like to urge you to check out KILL HANNAH, a little known band whose cd is coming out sometime next month."
1,Killing Rock and Roll,"Many analogies fly, comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians. Bands like this, although obviously imitating better bands like Green Day, shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence let alone ""compared"". Every time the music making department at Atlantic releases something like this, they may sell oodles of records, but they kill music a little more. I agree with that other guy. Go buy Nevermind. Music is an art, not a product. But that's just my opinion."
1,"no pads, no helmets........just [bad]!","(i am actually 14 yrs old)My friend has this cd, and I asked her if I could borrow it. Worst thing I ever did. The singer is really whiney. I could see why he was an unpopular person..."
1,I HATE WANNABES!!!!!,"i absulootly h@ wanabes they make me sick! ppl think their punk if they buy th@ sh*t from hottopic and listen to simple plan and other sh*t! it's the same evrywhere, they listen 2 avril lavigne and call themselvs sk8er bois, or they dress in black and call themselvs gothic! labels r 4 soup cans, and only some1 w/out a personality would just follow the crowd and buy whats popular! i also h8 whiners and preps, there r so many people whining about how terrible their life is and so on, we don't need to hear a grown man whining about their life, and pretending 2 b teenagers! hotopic just supports all those people buying th@ cheesy sh*t, so while im complaning about simple plan and all th@ sh*t might as well tell the world what i think about hotopic!!!"
1,And this cd is the worst one ever,You know it's a sad day for punk rock when 12 year old preppy girls flock to the NFG simple plan concerts. Why does punk rock suck so bad now? This cd is the epitomy of [bad] punk rock. If you want to listen to good punk/emo go buy Les Savy Fav ...
2,Another pop-punk band,"Simple Plan is anothe pop-punk band. This CD is pretty kick ass. They've given the guys a hard time with the IMMATURE stuff but they're trying crits! I got the record as a present and I really liked it although I wasn't planning to buy it. The guys are growin up and I'm sure critics are gonna shut up on their next album.Simple Plan is simple...if your a teenager and y u?re trying to write up a song then you?d probably come up with something like one of SP?s songs. The bonus (Grow Up) and hidden (Christmas) tracks are really good and probably they?re the songs you could relate to the most.I would really reccommend this album to anyone who likes GC, NFG or something like that."
1,Ugggghhhhh...,"The same rehashed Pop/Punk thats been used over and over again. Flavor of the week guaranteed. Let them have their moment in the sun. Let the little kiddies call themselves ""punk"". Let them have a taste of the rock star life style, but in a year they will be forgotten. This is what happened to Blink 182, and Sum 41 was really big for a while, but they're losing it already. Now, it's New Found Glory(who are starting to lose it), Good Charlotte, and this unholy drivel known as Simple Plan. This pop/punk thing will be over... give it a year or two. THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR GOOD MUSIC!"
2,Simple Plan Rules Canadian acts,I love Simple Plan adn i love this new album! all of the songs are really fun and easy to sing along with. It's constantly in my CD player and i take it with me every where. The boys are so talented at their insturments and I love Pierre's voice! This CD is definitly one to buy!
2,Sad lyrics with happy music... oddly nice.,"Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing, tearjerking 'Perfect' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. But the rest of the CD blares out happy-go-lucky guitar riffs, juvenile lyrics, and just plain fun. I've had the pleasure of meeting these talented guys, and that is really what they're all about. This is a great easy listening CD - it may not be earth-shaking or momentous, but it is just good clean fun. Favorites include 'My Alien', which is just a funny song about a rather odd girlfriend, 'God Must Hate Me', which I'm sure is something we all can relate to (luckily He doesn't!), and 'I'd Do Anything'. Pierre's vocals go nicely with the whiney pop-punk music of Seb, David, Jeff, and Chuck. These guys are great - see them in concert, they're even better."
2,Such a GREAT CD!! I love it!,"I really love this CD! It is more ""poppish-punk"" rather than true punk rock, but so good. The lyrics themselves are mostly about the pains of growing up and are sometimes on the down-side. However, musically this CD is so uplifting and is energy-packed. The songs are fun and the lyrics relatable for anyone who has ever been a teenager or 20-something, like me! They are a great band and the lead singer's voice is really unique. I love them because they are not only fun to listen to, but can actually sing. The best songs are toward the beginning of the CD, but really it's all good! For anyone who likes Good Charlotte, Avril, 3 Doors Down, Linkin Park, or Michelle Branch - or even if you don't; buy this CD."
1,Worst...band...ever,"Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit. They have to be the worst band ever. Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band. Not original at all. Overall this album is a -100,000. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!"
1,Garbage at it's finest,"This album is the prime example of what really bad pop is capable of. Now, I'm not bashing Simple Plan because it's Pop. There is some catchy pop that I don't mind. And I'm not gonna bash 'em for trying to be punk, though they are not, and if you think they are, you know NOTHING.Let's just focus on the music:Lyrics: Whiny, sappy 12-year old stories of hating the world. Tried and done. Some bands do it. This band doesn't, and it sounds terrible.Singing: The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying. It's unbelievable he's the lead singer.Guitars: Ok, they can play some basic rhythms. Yay. No creative parts whatsoever.Drums: The only aspect of the band I won't belittle or raise. But needless to say, nothing special.I won't even mention how awful their image is. I focused on the basics;Simple Plan Simple ... , God does hate them, and they are Kids, forever.Don't waste your time on this garbage."
2,love it accept for one thing,"Great value for the price..... very comfortable and easy to use. The one thing I find which causes some discomfort is the foot cushioning mechanism. Being that you are actually hanging by your feet in full vertical, I feel the cushioning should have been designed in such a way in order to prevent any possibility of pain..... I do experience pain in the back of my ankles once hanging for over a minute, or after doing crunches. I'm 5'5"" tall and weight 112 lbs., so it is not due to excessive weight. Otherwise the product is a great deal."
2,"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, finally!","When my table arrived, I couldn't wait for my husband to get home to assemble it. Turned out I didn't have to, it went together without a hitch. From the first use, I could feel a release of pressure in my spine that I hadn't felt in years. I took one star off since no matter how I adjust the height and foot rest, I still have to reach up and pull myself up (if I didn't slip this wouldn't happen). I wear boots so I slip less and can relax my feet, which also reduces the discomfort. I'm happy to deal with a little pressure on my feet in order to experience the euphoric release of pressure on my back, finally! It's amazing how your mood changes when the pain goes away..."
1,inversion table,junk you get what you pay for. you better make sure someone is with you even if youve been on one before. im 5ft. 7 and i have to set it at over 6ft. to be able to get back up.that probably wouldnt be so bad but now you are not lined up with the back so its very uncomfortable. its a wonder they havnt been sued yet. also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable. im sorry i tried to go cheap. i was better off going to sports authority for 200. i got a reebock that i can return much more easily if i dont like it. im going to try and give no stars as its not worth 1 star but i already put it in and i dont know if i can change it.
2,Worth every minute I spent on it,"Get the facts straight from the source. The author is convinced that MS SQL is the best thing since sliced bread and that fact alone makes you want to keep reading.

1,Works as a webcam but not as a digital camera,"It's a cute little thing, but who wants to pay $25 for a cute little keychain bobble? Put in a AAA battery, start it up, take one photo, and the battery is dead. But it doesn't tell you the battery is dead, so you keep taking pictures, but they don't get saved. When you go to download the photos, you find you've only got the first one. At the cost of one AAA battery per photo, this has got to be one of the most expensive digital cameras on the market.Works ok as a webcam, but because its not really designed for that, you have to hold it in your hand to use it, so it's more or less useless for that application too.Save your money!"
2,Love Chick Corea and Flora Purim Together,"I used to listen to What Game Shall We Play Today back in 1977. I never knew the name of the song or the amazing singer with the latin accent. After hearing the song in my head for over thirty years, I managed to locate it on Amazon a few weeks ago (wonderful benefits of modern technology). I love Flora Purim's voice, and the lyrics are beautiful. I am not a huge jazz fan, but I listen to this song over and over."
2,o.k. terrific,it's absolutely happening here. the gangmembers will probably be the evildoers' new police force
2,Amazing!,"I too worked for Wolff New Media writing the NetBooks. Michael Wolff struck me as one of those fairly arrogant, not-much-time-for-the-little-guy entrepreneurs. I always assumed he was just like the many suits who were always coming through the office. It never crossed my mind that he was having his own private war with these guys, the investors or venture capitalists or whoever they were. His book is not only a total eye-opener but it's an amazing piece of writing. I read it one sitting. I can't believe that all this was going on around me and that I had no idea. I guess this book is like Barbarians at the Gate or Liar's Poker, but it's different too. It's real writing. It's great writing. You're in Wolff's head--a place I never imagined I'd be or want to be. But damn if it isn't one of the funniest places I've ever been."
1,Only read if want to read everything available on net biz,"This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses, then go ahead, but I learned about as much on IPOs in the net world from a 10-minute Business Week article on eloan, and most of the stuff about predicting where the net is going is his thinking from a few years ago and is outdated. The book jumped around a lot, and it is hard to stay interested."
2,~ The Best of the Star Trek movies~,The long awaited movie of the Star Trek crew did not disappoint. This is the best of the Star Trek movies in my opinion. Gene Roddenberry thought so too. Thrilling scenes of the Enterprise coming out of dry dock. This director's cut adds some superb effects that don't stray from the original film intent. The storyline is pure and in keeping with TOS (The Original Series) the humor is there but not campy and over the top like some of the following Star Trek movies. Highly recommend .
1,"Must have for Trek colletors, otherwise...","Not much to be said about this film, use it for a sleep aid replacement. This or 2001:A Space Oddesy.The film is made longer, but not much so, (Even more BORING!)The Special Features are excellent, and much more exciting than the movie"
1,Not a good start for the films,"Someone, possibly the writer Harlan Ellison, possibly Steve my butcher, once called this The Motionless Picture. He was right. Terrible idea, terrible pacing, terrific special effects, and no fun watching Kirk and crew reunite. I can remember being about 13 when this movie came out, actually dozing off in the movie theater. Stick with Star Trek 2, 4, 6 and 8. All the even ones."
2,Excellent...the VI Bible,"I have used this book at my workplace for some time, and it is an excellent book. A must for any serious VI users. Now I am actually buying it so that I can quickly grab it for reference, instead of running down the hall to grab your friends copy."
2,Great non toxic product to reduce fly populations,"Rescue FTA Fly Trap Attractant works great. Using new attractant in the reusable bottle is much more economical than the disposable traps. While there is a little odor close to the bottle, it can be used safely around pets where you wouldn't want to use poisonous sprays and powders. And it really works!"
2,Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it,"Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue. This book really gave me new insight and a different way of thinking about the frozen tundra I really don't know a whole lot about, and made me appreciate its beauty in a new way and understand the importance of the landscape."
2,Great History Reading,"I read this book for a college history course. It is a great book to read if you are interested in understanding the effects of world war Ii on different people. If you are not open to New ideas about history, then this isn't your book. If you are open to the fact that an epic event such as world war II can have a tremendous impact on people from all different aspects of the US, then this is your book. Thanks Studs."
2,Great book,"I received this book as a gift, and subsequently purchased for a friend. The advice is practical, and the book isn't preachy. My 15mo old routinely uses 10 basic signs (milk, eat, pain, sleep, etc.), and I think our lives are much better for it. Instead of crying or shouting, she can ask for what she wants. I can't compare to other books, because I haven't read any, but sign language has been a very positive thing for our family, and we were successful using the advice in this book."
1,Poor Product,"First time i used this mop, it left a lot of water on the floor and the mop head fell off. The instructions do not tell you how to get it back on. I expected more from a Mr. Clean product. Very disappointing. I have emailed Mr. Clean with zero reply's!"
2,This Book is Truly An Eye Opener,I would recommend this book for All to read. It has truly changed my life for the better. I wanted to be closer to God and this book helped me connect with the higher power on a deeper level. This book has given me my faith back and has transformed my thinking and i am grateful that Dr. Stanley wrote this great book for those of us that are looking for answers to so many of life's questions. If you don't already have this book please get it. You will not be disappointed. I have a new way of looking at life and a new relationship with my creator.
2,A Fresh Look...,This book was wonderful. It gave new and practical insight into how we can truly hear from God. Stanley captures scriptural doctrine into every day practices that every Christian can and should implement.
1,Regretful,"So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better."
2,A Horror Treat for the Spooky season,"A must see film for the Halloween season! Behind the autumn beauty of a small New England town lurks the decay and evil of a Satanic cult. Behind the lanky frame of a Gay Goth lies the power of a witch. Behind the mundane world of humdrum life there are ghosts, murders, and tales of illicit lust. In his first film, James Fessenden has woven classic chilling elements to create a terror tapestry of cold-hearted malice. Things are seldom what they seem, and there is no room for security in a world that only seems to be tranquil and quiet. As an independent film, it should be judged by its sinister spirit and not by the production values. This is a film that deserves to be watched on a cold autumn night when the wind rattles the house and creaking boards add to the atmosphere. See it with someone you want to freak out!"
1,"Disorganized, incomplete, and unfriendly","The book has lots of information but one has to go through lots to loops to get to where the information should be and then it may not be there.E.g., the index has no mention of the 'wm' command--one that I often encounter.E.g., another book implies that there is a canvas command 'delete all'. After I finally got to page 61, I found the 'delete' command but NOT any hint that one can use the 'all' command to delete all the objects on the canvas.Another example, even though the book purports to cover TK--the visual side of the language--I find just one chart, .Needless to say, there are very few examples."
2,TCL/TK in A Nutshell,"""TCL/TK in A Nutshell"" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail. It's not for novices, though. Newcomers to the language should be advised to start with something suited for dummies, and from there to search the Internet for specific explanations and examples."
2,everything went as expected,Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
2,Roses,"I love romance novels that are clean, This was a very sweet book and fit into this category! After reading it I downloaded all the books by the author, Margaret Widdemer, free! I've not read any of the other ones yet."
2,Album Good For a Stupid Movie,I love this album. Don't scare me none is a good honest song. The movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's the reason JM hasn't done anything in the movies since.
1,Does not work buy something else,I purchased 3 traps and this was one of the three. Out of the three different traps this has caught one and I say one yellowjack in a week. The others have had to be emptied at least once...you do the math.
1,Does not work as effectivly as advertised,Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.
1,Rescue My Wallet,"Useless, a total waste of money. The wasps laughed at it. Did attract some flies however. So not totally useless."
2,The Gladiator,"I first saw this movie when it came out fifteen or twenty years ago and got it on video. I have been trying to get it on DVD for years, but it is not available in Australia. Thanks to Amazon I can watch it again and again."
2,legends at work,listening to roy hargrove and karl denson play is as exciting as joe henderson/lee morgon or miles an trane. nuff said
1,anyone see what i did with this cd? caint find mine...,"...AND IM HAPPY ABOUT IT!i think i might cry if'n it shows up again. fareals.if albums where 3 dimensional this wouldn e'en make the c-side!i love me some roy, but bruh hurt me with this one.i forgive him tho, cause he done gave me much much pleasure up til now... ...um, hope that came out right.*pimp struts off stage/pounds chest with gorilla fist/machismo free flowing*m'out yall, peace!"
1,Great movie; horrible DVD,"The movie is great but if you're buying it to own a high-quality, pristine copy to watch over and over again, you'll be disappointed.The DVD image is covered with white specks, dust, and long hairs. They appear every second or two and are very noticeable even at full-speed. I would expect a VHS tape to have better image quality than this.In addition, I couldn't get the ""special features"" menu to work on two of my DVD players (although one of my friends has no problem). This continued even after I exchanged the disc for a new one.If you absolutely must own this movie on DVD, then you have no other choice. But for the others, I would warn that this disc does not nearly match the quality of the other 95% of...discs available."
2,Over 120 Inspirational Recipes,"Presented by a renowned Thai restaurateur, Thai In Minutes: Over 120 Inspirational Recipes is a cookbook packed with swift and easy-to-prepare Thai dishes. Most have a total preparation and cooking time of about 15 minutes or less. Notes on Thai culture round out the simple instructions, full-color photographs and explanations of traditional ingredients. A must have for connoisseurs of Thai food who are short on cooking time, Thai in Minutes includes such mouth-watering delicacies as Vegetable Wontons, Pork with Garlic and Peppercorns, Mango Sorbet and much more."
1,Quality of DVD stincks,"I love the original series but feel cheeted. There were episodes that I remember that were not included. Mostly though the quality control in these DVD's is realy bad. My father owns a set, and he returned several sets before he got one that is mostly good. My set was good all the way through until the last disc. I have not returned it for fear that I'll get an even worse set.One of the things they did that I hate is they recorded on both sides of each disc, so if you get a bad one, a lot of episodes are potentially messed up."
2,where's Cy??,"I wouldn't call this a complete set. Does anyone remember the episode where Starbuck and the cylon are stranded on a planet, and the cylon(Cy) gives his live for Starbuck? A wonderful episode, yet it seems to have vanished!!!"
2,Im buying this set!!!!!,"Battlestar Galactica is my favorite all time show!Frack!I know alot of people are saying bad things about Galactica.Its All talk and it sounds like some of ya are just jealous!Battlestar Galactica has everything! Awesome music its better than star wars!Great special effects the vipers are so cool!Beautiful cast{Sheba shes nice and pretty,Athena a goddes,Cassiopeia so lovely and with Starbucks sarcasim it goes good with Apollos calm and cool attitude.Boomer is cool too!My favorite episodes is Saga of a star world,war of the gods,the hand of god,the living legend,Baltars escape,the long patrol and murder on the rising star!See ya!"
1,Terrible,"Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created, this series totally destroys any quality its amazing premise had with horrible plotting and dialogue, and acting that was even worse. Rightfully cancelled mid-way into its second (even worse) season, ""Galactica"" somehow found its own little niche audience.Like any other series created by Glen Larson, it has a great premise, but can't get anything else right. The characters are poorly drawn, swaggering fools, and the Cylons are even worse. They're slow-moving, dullards of machines. It's a wonder even the foolish crew of the Galactica and its rag-tag fleet were able to defeat them so readily EVERY TIME they go into combat.Avoid this set, unless you're REALLY into watching bad TV and movies. This belongs on the same shelf with movies starring the likes of Steven Seagal and Freddie Prinze Jr."
1,"Ohhh, Jilly, Jilly, Jilly","I await each Jilly Cooper book with great excitement. I love the pure escapism of her too good/too bad to be true characters. I love her witty turn of phrase. It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud and she has accomplished it before. . .not this time however. I actually forgot, several times, I was reading this book--it was boring, the characters annoying and the premise unoriginal. I strongly recommend you not waste your time--go back and review Rupert/Billy the early days."
1,To be avoided,"If you are a begginer looking for information on growing MJ or a more experienced grower requiring ideas then you will do very well to avoid this book. The material is poorly laid out, is often confusing as it is littered with spelling mistakes and seems to have been done in a slap dash manner [...] lots of ideas and details on hydroponic cultivation are very dated and would seem to date back to the late 1970's.[...]"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this set to have some extra sockets around the house. I was hopeful this would be a great product, but unfortunately, it's not. The whole set isn't very good in quality and I figure they would probably break if you used them very heavily. I just threw the set in the garage in case every other socket I have disappears, I at least have this set as a backup."
1,TERRIBLE!,Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement. Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car...I should have known better! Avoid this one! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Looked good out of the box. However, upon first use, the yellow handled driver broke. The plastic handle cracked while trying to loosen a nut. Then, the 1/4 inch adapter broke while using the ratchet inside the 13mm socket.Not a durable set of hardware to say the least."
1,You get what you pay for,"For the money, this is not a bad deal. Yet I found it to be of inferior quality. The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is ""triple chrome plated."" It is rough around the edges and is not like an evenly polished higher quality tool set you see at other stores. The driver handle is cheap plastic that reminds me of a similar one I had that split and broke from the shaft. For a flea market type set that does the job, I guess this is what you would be looking for."
1,worth it for the price,the ratchet is too weak. not even able take off one nut before it broke. need to shop for another one now.
1,Cheapest build quality I have ever seen in my life,"I know this is only 10 bucks and I was certainly expecting cheap and cheerful. But this beats all standards of a poorly made product. The blow molded case is a disaster - nothing fits in its place. The ratchet is the cheapest I have ever seen and the sockets themselves are very poorly finished. Comes with duplicate sockets - one each for quarter inch and 3/8 inch I believe. A simple 3/8 to 1/4 adapter would have sufficed, but that's an entirely separate design issue. I would never buy this again, even for the low price."
1,For display only,"I decided to buy this because I needed to do an oil change on my car. After two minutes of using it the wrench it got stuck and never worked again. You can actually tell it is bad quality just by turning it by hand. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone (not even for a small job). The item is on its way back for a full refund thanks to Amazon great customer service. Lesson learned, whether you use them a lot or not, these tools need to be of good quality so spend the extra couple of dollars and save yourself the hassle."
2,"Doesn't make you an expert, but more than enough to pass.","I only gave this book 4 stars because of the numerous typos. Bottom line is, it's an easy read--a much easier read than the Sybex book or the Cisco Press. If your goal is to pass the BSCN, and if you want a book that's straight forward, with the authors not trying to impress you with unnecessary technical mumbo jumbo, then this is your book. With this book, and the study questions from cheet-sheets.com, you're sure to pass. I passed with an 816 only reading this book once, reading two chapters a week. Just remember, you only need 690 to pass. Good luck."
1,Quick Shot?,"Thomas M. Thomas and his co-authors did a very poor job this time. When I studied for the BCMSN exam, I was glad to have a copy of the McGraw-Hill book, but this one seems to be nothing but a quick shot, published before the others do. Very rarely, I read a book containing such a huge amount of errors. Fortunately, many of them are such obvious that you have to notice them at once; and not all of them can be presumed to be errata (or at least, they shouldn't be). For example, a multicast address of 2214.0.0.10 (!) was stated, and you will be presented a chaotic mixing of hyphenated and non-hyphenated commands which you will surely be asked to keep apart in the exam.Some chapters as those covering (I'd better say: not covering) EIGRP or BGP are much too short because many topics - as route maps - are almost completely omitted. After all, I would recommend to read the Ciscopress book instead to be sure you get all the information needed."
2,One of my favorite CDs,"This CD is full of bouncy, upbeat dance music that is fun to listen to. The accordion playing is wonderful."
2,Dora's reviews,My husband and I watch this movie a lot. It is funny. I had never heard of this movie but I am glad I purchased it. I recommend it to anyone.
1,Disappointed child and mama!,"My 20-month old son loves Road Construction Ahead and many other videos that focus on earth-moving equipment and ""machines"", as he calls them. We purchased this video hoping to add a little variety to his collection but have been disappointed with it. For a young child, perhaps under 3, this video has far too much dialogue, not enough action, and loads of ridiculously unfunny jokes and slap-stick humor that little kids just don't get. My son likes looking at the video box but doesn't enjoy the video at all. Try Road Construction Ahead instead."
2,"Remarkable memoir, remarkable woman","Ayako Ishigaki's wonderful fictionalized memoir is revealing for it's sometimes subtle, sometimes angry, and sometimes tender treatment of the both the culture she was born into and the culture she experienced in the U.S. It's also a remarkable historical document that presents views of Japanese women that may startle the reader. The writing is fluid and engaging. You can read it easily in a day or two."
1,NOT the BEST from the BEST,"The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great. (I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part.) Everyone in the family, including the kids, hated the BAM! written all over their food but the food came out great. It worked fine for three or four months but then the non-stick coating started to bubble and peel off. And it is supposed to be high-end ALL-CLAD? It ended up being returned with no questions asked...makes me wonder how many others were returned. Hmmm..."
1,This has got to be the worst batman movie ever.,"Batman Returns is just plain sick at times. The Penguin, who used to be almost loveable in the original comics, is a homicidal nutball in the movie. The catwoman (who is in herself at times very disturbing.) is blond (she is supposed to be raven haired) and more of a pain to watch then anything else. The only redeeming value is the occational funny line from Penguin."
1,.,"Tim Burton's worst movie, hands down. It's visually interesting, but that's about all. Batman himself seems like a secondary character in this sequel, and unfortunately I couldn't get into Danny Devito very much. He plays the role well, I suppose, but the story is awfully flimsy and there just isn't much to latch onto here. I will say that Michelle Pfiefer ... oh my ... I had a crush on her for months after seeing this for the first time. And it isn't just the skin-tight leather outfit (although it sure helped.) My. But in any case, watching her was the only redeemable distraction I could find in this disappointingly poor movie."
2,"Batman: Returns, Awesome but dosent match ""Batman""","1992 saw the release of the much anticipating ""Batman: Returns"" and it really is a mixed feeling movie. Its enjoyable but in the way it dosent match its predessor ""Batman"" it is very cool how it is all dark and got a creepy vibe and its storyline is OK but it just dosent really meet perfection. Penguin is absolutely disgusting and i really hate him and Catwoman is cool but in other words they are cool villians. Same ""SPECIAL"" featues as #1. This film is good and I reccomend you to see it but if u have to choose 1 out of the 2 ""Batman"" is the way to go."
2,"""Gentlemen, start your screaming!""","Danny DeVito makes an execellent Penguine. And Catwoman teams up with the Penguine. Batman (Keaton) fights the two villains and defeats one of them. However, it isn't clear if Catwoman got away or not. One of the better Batman movies."
2,The best Batman!,"If you haven't seen it, you must. Michelle Pfiffer is the best catwoman...Halle Berry can't hold a candle to her awesomeness. Micheal Keaton is a great Batman. Definite must see!"
1,It;s too Dark,"I don't what I disliked about this movie the most. The fact that Gothom City looks like a war zone, or the fact that the story's focus is not on Batman again (even though the movie is called Batman) or that the Penquin is the most repulsive one ever created for film. The first movie had Jack Nicolson in it, this one has nothing."
1,Eeeyew!,This movie is disgusting. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and it seems the sole purpose of Danny Devito's Penguin is to be gross. At least the original Batman movie had some wit and decent music. Don't waste your time with this worthless use of videotape.
2,The best BATMAN ever!!!!!,"Tim Burton's direction shines in this picture. It's perfect. ""Batman Returns"" is dark and mysterious the way it should be. The series needs to return to these dark roots again; take the neon off the batmobile, take the nipples off the batsuit, and please get rid of Alicia Silverstone!!!! (And bring Catwoman back.)"
2,Great book,"This is a great book, honestly I have using a lot of its know-how on my job.My advise is that all reader should know the decorator pattern to understand better the class structure, and I hope in the next version add some information about it."
1,One man's biography,I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time.
1,Not enjoyable,"The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film. Unfortunately, I do not find myself among them. I could not wait for it to end. I watched the whole thing only because I had paid to rent it, but it was mostly a painful experience.No one is really connected to anyone in this film. Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short. None of the characters have much heart, and there are even several face-slapping scenes! The only appealing character was the young nerdy woman, who appears briefly. Please, let us have more well-written films with appealing characters."
1,April's Shower,It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.
2,depends,"This is a good book if you just want to read about what grace Slick did outside of Airplane and why she decided to do it. It isnt one of those books which documents every single date of release of album and what happened within the record company and how it was marketed in the nation etc.... Those books are good but to me this is a nice change to very complicated books, and although she does write the book in an informal manner, it makes it better as it sort of seems right to talk about stuff away from the band in the tone she uses. this book is mainly sex, drugs, and a bit of rock and roll. Still very funny and good sense of humour though. Just depends what style of book you are after."
1,A horribly written and edited book about the queen of rock.,"Where did Grace find this ""writer"" to co-author her biography? What could have been a terrific and insightful look at one of rock and roll's greatest and most rebellious icons instead reads like entries from a diary. Poorly sequenced and unimagitively written, this book suffers from an obviously inexperienced co-author who has a pre-occupation with Slick's sexual trysts and demonstrates little interest in nor knowledge of her music-making. She should stick to writing romance novels. I'll remember Grace Slick for her electrifying performances and wonderful music, but never this book. Get it from the library and save your money."
1,Disappointing,Considering the life she's led I would have expected more from Slick's autobiography. A big yawn--I skimmed through the last 200 pages.
2,This book had a lovely romantic twist to it!:),"I am not a great fan of Mrs. Alcott, but when I began reading this book, I was immeditaly hooked. The plot was so interesting and something happened in each chapter--and whatever happened always had to do with Edith--wheather it was Lady Ida cursing her or Lord Percy admiring her--it always had to do with her. This book had a romantic feel to it, and it wasn't how I would have expected it to be. The romantic part was kept hush-hush amongst the charecters--but the irony of it was everyone knew about it. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new summer book. It's great!"
2,Astral Projection at their finest,"Astral Projection has been making the greatest trance for years and years. And its great to see that after more than 5 years, they are as good as ever! Although I dont think any track on Another World matched the power of their early classic ""Powergen"", every single song off this album is amazing. Astral Projection have changed their sound a little bit from their prior ""Dancing Galaxy"" album, adding some new progressive-sounding synths to their arsenal. Still they keep their own original flavor. This is my favorite album of 99 so far and if you knew anything about true trance music, you would agree!"
1,Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money,"I was really disappointed by this DVD. My acupuncturist had recommended that I try a Rodney Yee video, but I don't think he knows that this is mostly fluff--there's lots of advertising and talking, but only 20 minutes of actual yoga. So as a yoga session, it's just too short to be of much use except for absolute beginners--but it's clearly not aimed at them, as Rodney uses poses that true beginners would not already know, and does not instruct in how to do them.More important, the yoga exercises are too short. The program is 90% stretching, but the stretches are not held long enough to be effective. The poses are also too brief. And there are not enough of them--real back work involves strengthening back and abdominal core, but there are only a few poses in this program that do that.Based on this DVD, I will not buy anything from this source: it feels like a moneymaker scam to me."
1,Backcare Yoga for Beginners,This product is garbage and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves even allowing it to be sold on line to unsuspecting customers.
2,Terrific purchase,Beautiful Sateen sheet set. Price was great and quality is above average. Will definitely purchase from this merchant for all my bedding needs. Great seller!!!
1,Not much here,I was dissapointed in this little book. It looks like the book was rushed out to capitalize on the war and Rumsfeld media attention. Not much here in terms of learning - Rumsfeld is pretty command and control.
2,Krames Provides a Quality Read on Rumsfeld,I liked the way the book was organized. It distills Rumsfeld into an understandable person with recognizable leadership principles and skills. You can see why he has been successful and even appreciate his no-nonsense approach. A good quick read on a unique individual.
1,Pointless,"What a waste of money! She loves the life she didn't expect? Page after pages sounds more like she's praying for a man to come along and save her. Let's all just bide our time until a man comes along. I don't fault her for wanted to get married, but the last thing I wanted to read this weekend were a bunch of short stories about how all her friends are getting married and she isn't. The reality is if she really loved the life she didn't expect she would talk about all the things she has done because she is single. If I had gotten married, I never would know the joy of living on my own, come vacation time I always get to pick where I go next and I love my career. Believe me, there is something to be said for doing what you want, when you want without input from someone else. Sure someday I may get married, but he would have to be a heck of a guy for me to give what I've got. So bottom line, live your life for you, not for someone who may or may not come into your life."
1,disappointing,"I was expecting so much more after _Dawn and this book wasa disappointment. I know many people who never bothered toread the last book in the series because this one lefta bad taste in their mouths.The characters just didn't connect, no empathy with them."
2,Love it! Love It! Love It!,"Love it! Love It! Love It! ""The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit"" by Thomas Lucier is very informative and a must read for anyone interested in this type of real estate investing. Mr. Lucier tells in detail how to negotiate with homeowners in trouble, how to be the solution to their problem, and how NOT to have the door slammed in your face. He also demystifies the process of dealing with the homeowner's lender by explaining in detail each step in the process of taking the property off their hands. This book, along with Dean Graziosi's [[ ASIN:1593154461 Be A Real Estate Millionaire: Secret Strategies for Lifetime Wealth Today]] have helped me so much in understanding how to be successful with foreclosures."
2,"BUY THIS BOOK, Valuable information and web sites.","This is a fabulous book full of very valuable information. Where to find and how look up information on a property.Straight forward no nonsense information.Many websites resources listed in this book that help you research a perspective property.

2,"information was easily applied,","This book, was very well organized. easy to understand and apply, I ordered three books and this was the best of all three."
1,Don't waste your money....,"Different paperweight, same seller: I ordered 3 of these from this seller. They came defective. Each of the dahlia pictures had flaws/defective markings. It looked like a crease in the picture or a depression made from to much pressure. The quality just wasn't there & I just couldn't give them as gifts as planned. I contacted the seller & shared this with them. They would not provide me with a postage paid return label to send them back & really didn't seem to care that they sent me defective items. There just wasn't customer service offered. I bought it, they have their money & whatever, not their problem. I began researching their reviews & found this was normal for them. I wish I had never made this purchase. I am out even more by having to pay for my own return shipping on these defective paperweights to get a refund & this is money I really don't have to spend. I would never purchase from them again & I hope you don't have the same experience I have had."
2,Just great!,"I heard Van Hunt on NPR and immediately ordered the CD. In his interview with Travis Smiley, he mentions that one of his favorite artist is Prince. Mine too!As other reviewers have mention,this is no ordinary artist and an extraordinary CD. Van Hunt is amazingly talent. I can't say what I like more the voice, music or lyrics. It's very hard to categorize his style. The best way to know is to listen to the sample clips.I've played the CD as background music when entertaining guests and have received great reviews. You won't be disappointed."
2,Good book to understand USA for an european,After my own travel through USA I red Steinbekc's book. It has given me the oportunity to understand a lot of your spirit. His openminded vision is one I have not seen so often over your interesting nation
2,One of the Best Travel Books Ever Written,"I just finished the book and it was a fantastic read. It was a fairly ""light"" book, considering the author; it was genuinely hilarious at times, and, as always, Steinbeck created an incredibly vivid, personal, and accurate portrait of the relationships between nature and society. Shades of his earlier can be seen in the prose style, and his unconditional devotion to the creation and development of images and characters can't be matched by anyone from any time.As far as a ""Travel-style"" novel is concerned, I think I liked this one more than Kerouac's On the Road...but, then again, Steinbeck was far more talented than any of the Beats -except Ginsberg (who might've been in his league, but in a junior-varsity-type capacity) and maybe Neal Cassidy.If you like Steinbeck, you will really enjoy reading this book."
2,Traveling,"I liked some of his other works better, but this one is OK. The concept is good but now it is somewhat dated as his trip was in the '60s."
1,This book deserves less than one star,"This is the most boring book I have ever read in my entire life, and I have read quite a few books. How Steinbeck could say soooooooo much about soooooooo little makes my head hurt. It is very good if you are an insomniac, though."
1,torture!!,"This book is painful to read because you are hosted by a crotchety old man who is annoyed by life and loves no one except his dog. He meets people who he finds boring and visits places that insult him and tells you about all of the lousy things that happen to him and then reminds you of all of the good things that have disappeared about America. If you love Steinbeck don't read this book because perhaps you are meeting the real man and you will feel different about his other beautiful books. If you don't know Steinbeck and want to, try Pastures of Heaven or Cannery Row. Those books are how you want to remember him by, and not by this last, wheezing gasp."
2,As timely now as when released...,"This film is a must-see for those who have power over war and peace. Think about it - the peace treaty is about to be torpedoed by high ranking officers of both the Klingon Empire and the Federation, who stand to lose big time if peace ever breaks out.Is there any similarity to the present Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Looks like it... Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made. Almost seems like the rogue Federation and Klingon officers of this film. But I digress...This picture is a huge credit to the filmakers of the Star Trek saga, just when it was most needed (after the disaster that was Star Trek V). If you are interested in serious science fiction, toelrance between cultures or are in the mood for a good thriller, watch this one. If you live in the Middle East, by all means watch this one!"
1,Booklet NOT included!!!!!!! Paramount execs are tightwads.,"Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.After ""re""-releasing all 5 movies in its ""special edition"" format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular ""no extras"" format, the executives in an effort to ""save costs"" decide to skimp out on the booklet. Booklets which which accompanied the previous five special edition releases!So after all that the executives manages to screw the loyal fans once again -- enough to make one FUME with rage.That's not to down grade the movie -- which is exceptional due to Nick Meyer's direction. Mr. Meyer, if you read this I hope you give the TIGHTWAD Paramount execs a piece of your mind on our behalf."
2,Fine Trek,"Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good."
2,The Final Journey,"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is probably the most entertaining film of the Star Trek franchise. Released in 1991, 2 years after that stinker Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (It had it's brief moments, though) Kirk and crew make their final journey after 25 years of thrilling us with their adventures. Awesome special-effects, excellent acting all around, an incredibly good villian (Chang) played well by Christopher Plummer and a perfect ending, passing on the torch to the crew of Star Trek: The Next Generation. An absolutely thrilling Star Trek film to watch again and again. Kirk returned in Star Trek: Generations meeting a tragic fate at the end. If you haven't yet, add this great Star Trek film to your collection."
2,Not the best Star Trek ever but Great Price,"Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days, very well packaged. Great Buy!"
2,The voyage home is the best,"I liked all three movies but it wasn't until they got to ""The search for Spock"" that they got the editing right on the Star Trek movies. Very intertaining though."
2,Wierd but interesting,Attila was an interesting yet strange book. The character goes through a mixture of complex reality mixed with hallucinations. I specially enjoyed Chapter 5.
2,"Used Boat Notebook: From the Pages of Sailing Magazine, Reviews of 40 Used Boats Plus a Detailed Look at Ten Great Used Boats","As expected from Sailing Magazine, a well written and comprehensive guide in the selection of great used sailboats. Covers all of the pluses and the minuses of 40 'classic plastic' sailboats from small to large. Of particular interest is the review of things to look for and problems that exist as well as performance and accomidations."
1,Not worth reading!,Still trying to validate the paper it's printed on. The only thing I liked about the book was the design of the pages. Found the essays not especially well written and am looking forward to discussing it with our book review group to see if they can actually shed some light on the issues. Guess I wasn't lonely enough to want to crawl up with this book....it made me fall asleep.
1,Author in Jail for Criminal Tax Evasion,"Larken Rose has been sentenced to 15 months in jail for failure to file. If you follow his advice and the IRS prosecutes, you will lose. The information in this video is 100% false by the rulings of the IRS and dozens of courts in the prosecution of those who took Rose's advice. This IRS is aware of people using the fraudulent information in this video and screens returns for people making frivolous arguments such as this.The IRS has a publication entitled: ""The Truth About Frivolous Arguments"" - Larken Rose's arguments are among those in this publication."
2,Redemption for Eddie Murphy,"Finally, a funny Eddie Murphy movie that my children can watch. Not the usual garbage mouth from Murphy."
2,Because Of The Songs & The Year,"1945 was a very significant year in the history of the world, but certainly not for this movie. I was 10 years old & though my parents did not go to see this movie, the song, ""Don't Fence Me In"" was very popular & became engraved in my heart along with ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds.""Since I grew up in southern CA, I saw many tumbling tumbleweeds & I am happy now to have finally seen the movie - even though it is not a particularely good movie I am giving it 4 stars just for sentimental reasons."
2,Excellent resource for busy educators,"Having purchased many types of teaching resources over the last few years, I have finally found one more helpful than all the others combined. Evertson not only outlines the procedures in an easy to read manner, but she also gives excellent examples of her theories in practice. I was expecting a book that strictly dealt with keeping order in the classroom, but what I received was so much more. This book describes ways to teach that will ensure that classrooms run smoothly and more importantly the students learn. I only hope that other new teachers find this text at the beginning of their careers as the advice contained is invaluable. If your budget or time schedule only allows for one book, definitely buy this one!"
1,the movie with kristi swanson was better.,"i think that the show is dumb and that buffy in the movie is a senior! in the show, she's a junior. what's the deal? and i think that kristi is a much better buffy."
2,Hot Buffy Tapes a Must!,"I am a die-hard Buffy fan and I was thrilled to find out that I could get the episdoes on tape. The tapes include:Welcome to the Hellmouth/ The Harvest, Witch, Never Kill a Boy on the First Date, Angel, The Puppet ShowAll of the shows are wonderful and I highly recommed that you buy them!!!!"
1,Poor Product,Don't waste your money on this one. It didn't work for me right out of the package. I didn't bother to replace the batteries since the device is obviously made cheaply.
1,Touchpad mouse,"I have had to use the touchpad type mouse for years due to a pinched nerve, causing my hand to go numb.The old one, from years ago was far, far better than this one! I guess they were bought out and the qualityis not so great. I cannot make the software work with Vista. They made a simple thing more compliacted.I wish that my old one had not worn out and it would work with Vista. Please, someone come up with a REALLYgood touchpad mouse for a P.C."
2,Me too...,"A friend of mine turned me onto these, in one word... great! However, for my first major day of usage at a local outdoor concert, a young kid whom was looking the other way, stumbled over my footrest and broke it. Being that the footrest is really the best part of the chair, I was extremely disappointed. Unfortunately, no apology was offered. I will attempt a fix on my own, otherwise try to return or buy a new one."
1,A beach disaster,"We received two chairs...the arm on the first one broke when the first person sat in it. A 160 pound man, not a giant person. The second one won't fold up. So they are useless."
2,Folding Chair Reviewed,These chairs are so comfortable that we move them from the deck to the inside of the house to watch T.V.......and so easily moved that they go back out again in the morning!
2,Uniquely Superb,"The Cyclical Serpent provides and excellent review of the wisdom of the ages and how they are relevant and to, and supported by, the latest astronomical observations and brilliant theories of physics that are so clearly explained by Dr. Halpern. This book makes the wonders of the universe understandable and their correlations to our every day lives observable. I highly recommend this read!"
2,"Great binoculars, great price","I was looking for inexpensive, but functional, binoculars to use with school groups in outdoor settings. These binoculars are WAY better than I expected for the price. The optics are crisp and the binoculars are easy to focus with the rocker-type focus (easier for kids than a dial that has to be turned). They are relatively small and lightweight (given the power). To be nit-picky, the only minor disadvantage is that they have lens caps that do not have straps to hold them to the binoculars, but that's the case with most of the binoculars that I have already. So...I'll set aside the caps and not worry about taking them into the field. The neck strap is a basic, narrow webbed strap, although the strap on the case is wider and potentially more comfortable for extended carrying."
2,Good Packaging,"Good packaging, awesome for sightseeing. Has a case and covers, which adds to the protection and care of these binoculars."
2,"this is a quality product, totally worth the price","I bought this for binocular for those occassional trips to the national parks. I did not want something too expensive, (as it would be for occasional trips) or too cheap (wanted something with a decent magnification for widlife watching). This is a decent size binocular. Easy to focus, thanks to the instafocus. It produces very bright and clear images, and the 7X zoom also works well for bird watching etc. Tried looking at some birds on trees in the neighbourhood. It comes with a pouch, 4 lens caps, a soft cloth for cleaning the lens and 2 shoulder straps, one for the binocular and the other for the pouch. It has a very solid, well made feel and the entire outer body is covered in rubber for better grip and protection. Overall, a very good product well worth the price."
2,Big Bang for the Buck,"I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew. My wife and I love them! They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other. We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene. They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.I would definitely recommend them to a friend and we might even get a second pair for the travel trailer."
1,Plain stupid,This book is stupid... the romance... the vampires... everything and why did she use that poem? Amelia never actually stated if these vampires are demon or not. They hold emotions of love and that doesn't make 'em demon...
2,I couldn't put it down,"The minute I got this book I started it. From that time on, I never put it down... I loved it. I'm not a big reader, but I was so into this book, I think it is an awsome book, along with the one before it, In the Forests Of the Night. I now own them both, and plan on getting the next one soon."
1,Ugh.,"I picked up this book looking for something interesting to read.And I must say I was a bit jealous to find that this author is a year younger than I am and has an array of books published.But you know what? I'm no longer jealous. Because a retarded monkey could come up with better character developments and plots than Ms. Atwater-Rhodes has put in this novel.I barely got halfway through this book when I threw it across the room, finished with the drivel that she called a story. It immediately earned a place next to Foxfire and To Ride a Silver Broomstick in my collection of ""Books I would never sell to anyone for I would not want them to suffer by reading this crap.""Save yourself some time and buy anything by LJ Smith, Kelley Armstrong, or (dare I say it) Anne Rice. Even Ms. Rice is better than this girl, and I hate that woman."
1,Over Hyped,"This book is many times more shallow then I would have expected from such a praised writer. For all the magazines (Teen, Y.M etc...) I expected to read a story with some depth.Not one with simple, personalitiless characters that easily fall into cliches. But this is not the only problem the entire concept is done in an amaturish manner.It's obvious within minutes of starting the story it was written by someone without any real-world-experience.The only thing that this book accomplished was to prove that Hype can't make a story."
1,Horrible teenybopper fluff,"""Demon In My View"" (the title is lifted from Poe's poem ""Alone"")contains nothing of redeeming value, or any serious literary merit. I think any 6-yr old could produce better art while half-asleep. The story is trite, confused, slow, and stereotypical. The editor should be immediately fired for letting this into the market. The annoying social consciousness, laughable teenage ""angst,"" and downright idiocy will appeal to the ""Dawsons Creek"" crowd I am sure, but this is not for me, or any other discerning and intelligent reader."
2,And I don't have short arms.........,"I had shoulder surgery and had to buy a recliner to sleep in as I healed. I am 5'8"" and don't have stubby arms but I could not reach the handle to put the legs down on the recliner. I saw this and purchased it. My whole family is glad, since even my 6'2"" husband and father had trouble reaching it to."
1,"Big Need for this Solution, Poor Design in the Execution","I am an Ergonomics Consultant with VERY short arms. This product looked like just what I needed to be able to reach the handle on my recliner without over-extending my right shoulded. I injured it about a year ago, and it has been difficult for me to reach the handle more than ever.Unfortunately the design of the product made it only slightly easier for me to reach the handle and the hard metal handle stuck out into the walk way and I must have hit my leg on it 5 times before I decided to return it. I applaud Standers for their attempt at addressing this issue, but they missed the mark in my opinion when it came to design."
1,Left hangng,"Troll Quest is a well written book until you get to the last chapter where the author appears to have just gotten tired of writing. The book builds slowly, a well written storyline headed for a climactic finale and then the reader is left hanging with no conculsions and no sequel. Very frustrating and disappointing."
2,Now this is fun....,"Besides thrills,laughter,easy readings,great conversations and a bit of mystery and a lot of suspense,you will get a fine dose of humour.McBain at his funny best."
1,Do not buy this book,This book has so many mistakes it should be used as a door stop or fuel for the fireplace. I ended up referring back to inside VC++ 5.0 and looking at the COM section in that book. If you need to learn about com see gopalan sureshes web site. He give practical information on COM and CORBA.
1,what a piece of waste!,"this book goes on and on and on about the same thing. the author must love to hear him self rambling in a empty space. there is no useful information in this book. if you want to learn COM and DCOM, buy microsoft press's books."
1,I wouldn't take this book from a friend for free.,"Here's a little blurb from the ""Why is COM Needed"" section:""... Each compiler produces a set of machine language instructions (binary numbers) that are designed to be fed by the operating system into the CPU of the computer in structured ways to produce program behavior...."".With gems like that early in the book, how could I take the rest of the book seriously as a technical work? I pressed on, but basically the rest of the book seemed disorganized and filled more with studying example output from ""wizards"" and such.Maybe if you're looking to study micros~1 Visual Studio ""wizard"" output, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a solid understanding of the basics, stay away.BTW, ALL authors should lay off the lame attempts at humor. Readnig bad attempts at humor are much worse than reading a technical book that is dry."
2,Great Stuff,"The reviewer was quite rough. Not every song on this CD is great, but it has some of the most rockinest music I have ever heard for the most part, especially the first two tracks."
2,great album,"I luckily found this cd at a used bookstore. It was a great find, since it is hard to get now a days. I had first heard it when I was in college. It is one of those albums that sticks with you years later. It is a great driving cd. The songs are upbeat and groovy that make you happy."
2,Bunuel at his best,"This was the first Bunuel movie I saw and it stays my favorite. I saw it in the movie theater and by the end 70% of spectators had left. The reason was that they were not prepared for Bunuel (It was in Gorki, Soviet Union, 1986 or 87). I wasn't either but I fell in love with the movie from the very begining. It stupid to try to reveal the plot, because there's none. If you ask me, the plot of this movie is the same as in That Obscure Object of Desire (my second best Bunuel): You can't get what you crave for. For it's not the plot that matters, it's the mood, l'ambiance. And those little things like the story about Brigadier. If you have never seen a Bunuel film, start with this one!"
2,"Short, but pretty good.","In UC 0079 Zeon learns of a new type of Gundam being built on the colony of Libot. They send a spec ops team to investigate. Bernie's Cyclops is shot down on the mission and he meets a boy named Al. Al is infatuated with mobile suits and follows Bernie around on his mission. Al's neighbor is actually the test pilot of the new machine. As this story unfolds their lives will be changed forever.This Gundam series is only 6 episodes. It's is a bit older so the animation is very dated, but the story is pretty good. Even though this is one of the weaker Gundam series it's still good and worth taking the time time to watch."
2,Best gundam show,I would consider this one of the best gundam series. Highly recommend if one were interested in any gundam series.
1,I got Snaked,"This cable looks good, feels good, is easy to use, but only works if the ends are wiggled and twisted. I could not get it to connect correctly on two different amps and one electric guitar. Pass on this one. A lesson learned; you get what you pay for!"
1,Assembly is a bit tricky,"Disappointed that I found it impossible to assemble the stands. You have to watch out that there are different length pre-drilled holes at the different ends of the pillars. I also didn't have an extensive toolkit to be able to redrill and enlarge the pre-drilled holes to make the assembly much easier. Things were so tight, I couldn't drive the screws in even with a powertool. Otherwise they looked good quality construction and should suit smaller sized rear surround speakers. With appropriate planning you should be able to avoid breaking screws like I did. Onecall don't pay for return shipping and Sanus were happy to send replacement parts, but I decided to return the item anyway. Maybe you'll have more success."
2,Best Futuristic Maiden CD,"This CD is another wonderful CD of legendary NWOHM Band Iron Maiden !!!Listen ""Heaven Can't wait"" and ""Wasted Years"" , and you'll see why these songs are in almost every Live Concerts of Maiden ....Particularly I love ""Deja Vu"", It's melodics chords make me feel in another place in another world.....Really It's fantastic...Also it's portrait is the best cover design of Maiden Albums....I recommend !!!!!"
2,MASTERPIECE!!,"Simply put, the best Iron Maiden album ever made. If you consider yourself even romotely a Maiden fan, you already own this album."

1,Barebones re-release,"The He-man and She-ra Christmas Special has a special place close to my heart. This is why it makes me so sad to see such a barebones release. This DVD has absolutely no extras (well, it does have a chapter selection?). This is not even a remastered transfer. What makes this edition even more redundant is the fact that in 2005 there was another version that was loaded with extras.Skip this release as theHe-Man & She-Ra - A Christmas Special(2005) is the one you want. Unfortunately, it is out of print, but you can still get it from some sellers (albeit at a slightly higher price)."
1,NOT A Learning Book,"This book would have been better had it not included ""Learning"" in the title. This is not a book for learning how to program in Java. Instead, this book plays a lot more like an overview of core concepts in Java for practicing programmers. This book would probably have been better suited in the ""Nutshell"" series, but even as a reference, it's a rather weak text because it keeps pretending to be instructional. This book is pointless.This book is absolutely not for novice programmers. You have to have some experience with the C/C++ language and OOP concepts to really get the meat of this book.This book does include a *few* things that are nice for novices to know, but it's nothing you won't find in any other book on the topic."
2,no title,"From the producers of ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" and it shows. Practically nonstop mayhem. And very much like the last two Mad Max movies, particularly in the costumes, makeup, and the town, which somewhat resembled Barter Town. Liotta, however, is no Mel Gibson; there didn't seem to be that hardness at his core that Gibson can project. However, I did thoroughly enjoy it in spite of the constant violence. Was filmed in Australia, with some gorgeous scenery shots. But far too much violence and very graphic. Although its message was good. I would think some scenes here could cause nightmares among the young and the more susceptible. There's really nothing wrong with the movie's plot; it's just that we're now too good in the technical department, and can make violence so real these days. Maybe we need to downgrade here, and not be so graphic."
2,Pretty Good,"Contrary to the other reviews,I didn't have any problems with these headphones. I had them hooked up in a few minutes, it was very simple. The only thing to wait for is the batteries to charge. I walked around the house and outside without any problems and was outside before I had a little distortion, but nothing too major. I wear a size 7 and 3 quarters baseball hat and had no trouble with these fitting my huge head. They are adjustable to somebody much smaller and also much larger than myself. I do think this is a great product considering JVC website has them for 130 bucks and I bought them on Ebay for 18 bucks new in the box. I will be buying these for my friends and family for Christmas, an excellent product."
1,Don't bother!,"After reading mixed reviews, I purchased this product. It was to be used outside but wasn't tried out until several months later. BIG MISTAKE! I'm sure the HAW300RF is as bad. If you turn your head, you lose the signal even well within range even in the same room! Garbage!"
1,Aurora Leigh from general books publishers,"I bought this book (General Books edition) from Amazon, and am more than disappointed with it. It is scanned and unedited. It is illegible! Now I will have to buy another copy from a reputable publisher. EBB's poem is wonderful! This edition is simply unreadable!"
1,A letdown,"Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic 1999 live offering, Electrica. The only saving grace is ""Para De Chorar,"" the very funky club-style bonus track. Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing ""Ill Parole Negra"") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed. I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band, but this one disappointed on first few listens. Who knows, though. Maybe it'll grow on me. (Stranger things have happened...)"
1,broke on the first use,"I purchased this on the strength of the Mr. Clean name. Big mistake. The handle and mop head parted ways on the first use and refused to be reunited! There was no direction on the packaging on what to do if this happened, the web site was useless, and the 800 number isn't manned on weekends (which is when I do most of my cleaning). After thirty minutes of trying to fit the handle back onto the mop head, I gave up. Everytime I fit it together, the top popped off again. This was a waste of money and time. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
2,A Real Lesson that can be applied to life,"Snow White-a tale of terror isn't just a tale that is merely entertainment. This tale actually teaches you about life. It's very real, dark and hopeful at the same time. I loved Lili and her courage to defeat the evil stepmother. I liked how it was a battle between good and evil. I think it has a lot to teach about vanity, jealousy, and deception. Not to forget, LOVE. Real Love! Lili was a courageous character and I aspire to be like her."
1,are you kidding me ? so much for the hype.,"This movie couldn't hold our attention tonight. Painful to watch in so many ways. Gruesome, really dark take on snow white which looked interesting at first blush. If only there was something more than shock and bland dialogue! Just didn't do it for us. Given the positive reviews I guess we're in the minority."
2,I became a documentarian because of this film.,"After seeing this film, I literally changed career paths from narrative to documentary filmmaking.It's authenticity and depth is unmatched by many other documentaries, probably due to the relationship between the documentarian and the subject. If you haven't seen Apocalypse Now, watch that first. I also recommend to anyone that loves Apocalypse Now to see this documentary, because you will have a greater appreciation for both of them."
1,Pact With The Devil doesnt pack a punch or a hit,"This movie is about a man named Louis, played by Ethan Erickson (The In Crowd, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), and he becomes a model, and his manager is the wilyeyed Henry, played by Malcolm McDowell. McDowell tells Louis about the story of Dorian Gray and how he made a pact with the devil. Louis or Dorian now writes in blood and he soon has eternal youth. This very interesting movie gets it fuel towards the middle but it can't help it. Very predictable. Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, I:Spy) is wasted in my mind and why the hell is this movie introducing Ethan Erickson? He has been in a movie or two before this and a tv series..come on people get with it. Erickson is an ok actor and he does some ok acting in this. Unspeakably boring for a while, then it gets a shot of something and then it goes into a coma."
1,Bad book,"Although there are only a few books currently discussing about the internal of JVM, this book is the worst of them. It copies too many pages such as the bytecode semantics from the JVM specification by Sun Microsystems and these parts consume around half of the books. Also most contents not borrowed from JVM specification is far too simple to be an indepth discussion of JVM. It only took me 2 hours to read the whole book and to find out that it is a bad book."
1,Save your money...,"This book tries to cover topics in a very abstract way. You do not get a feel for the components that make up a VI project. It barely touches on Design Time Controls. It just tells the user what these things are, I could have found that out by looking at the help files of VI. I need some pratical examples of how to use these components, which this book has miserably failed to provide. There is no source code availble on their web site either like they say. I went there and their web site kept giving me errors. In short, if you are looking for help on building useful sites buy another book."
1,Contents need more explanation and depth,"A lots of mumble-jumble materials which never really materialized for once. The instructions at times can be very frustrating with its example and procedures on showing you how to use InterDev. In the end, for me anyway, I find other books, even if they were not specificly written for Visual Interdev 6, offered more useful references and materials that actually kept me refering back to them from time to time."
1,This Chair is bad,"It would not support 100lbs. It fell apart as soon as my hind end hit it. If your looking for an outdoors chair, DONT get this one! Just givin some info, SHADY"
2,bread flour,Excellent quality flour for bread making. This is the 2nd time I have ordered it and will definitely continue!
1,uhhhhh,"when i first heard this album it was garbage,now im in to hip hop like krs-one tribe called quest kweli,but this album is completely lacking tight lyrics or beats please dont buy this album unless you are collecting lol"
1,Technically Inaccurate,"I bought this book because I am working on a software project that involves Exchange 2000. However, the book's author does not use proper terminology. For example, they talk about SAM replication times but Exchange 2000 uses Active Directory. They talk about site connectors but Exchange 2000 uses Routing Group Connectors. I know this product is still in Beta, but RC2 is feature complete. This book could have been better. Only buy this if you absolutely need to implement Exchange 2000 ASAP. If you read Microsoft's documentation first, you can weed through this book for more details."
1,Recent purchase,"I can't really say anything about the product because I have not recieved it. I bought the item in late September and was promised to be delievered early October but never recieved it. It is now October 31, and the item is still not here."
1,Piss poor unoriginal mallcore,"Don't waste your time buying this garbage. This band has the worst singer, no memorable guitar hooks or riffs, some leads but isn't enough to redeem them from the hordes of crappy and redundant hardcore stylings. The bottom line is I've heard it done better by many other bands. If you want something that will expand your mind with crazy offbeats then I would recommend bands like Arsis, Dillenger Escape Plan,or anything by Mastadon. These guys suck and I have no idea why the hell they are touring with Megadeth. I hope they get booed off stage. They should have gotten Municipal Waste to open up."
1,Horrible Song,Nelly is doing more singing than Janet Jackson is on this clunker that alone spells trouble. dime a dozen track with no feeling or meaning. this is a ok B-side but not worthy of a lead off single&especially not worthy to remember the Control project from 20 years back. but Janet Jackson has been played out for well over a Decade to me&this song only adds to that point.
2,"Good book, but Deathly Serious","Elvis Cole used to be more of a smartass and, I hate to say it, I miss the old smartass days. Now, everything is deathly serious and I'm having trouble enjoying Crais' books as much. It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get ""serious"" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down. This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all."
1,The LAst Detective Audio Book,"I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book, but my purchase. My CD was incomplete. It covered the first chapter, 31 minutes. The rest of the audio was deleted, or just wasn't there. I was very disappointed.The Last Detective (Elvis Cole) [Abridged][Audiobook] (Audio CD)Alvin"
1,Surprized,"I have been a fan of Robert Crais, thats why I was VERY SURPRIZED with The Last Detective. I was dissapointed at its length at first, 300 pages, but James Lee Burke can write a great book in just 300 pages, so, maybe can Crais. I was wrong! Very dissapointing. And what was the bear thing all about?"
2,Elvis Cole is back again!,"The return of Elvis Cole is well worth the wait. Robert Crais moves Elvis right into action during the first chapter. He is caring for his girlfriend's son and in just one moment the boy disappears. The ensuing search for the boy centers upon's Elvis's Vietnam memories, and a box hidden in his closet that contains medals and pictures. This is not a mystery solved easily- lots of turns and tangles. Old nemesis and the return of Carol Stanger from a previous novel keep this storyline fresh and right on the edge of your seat. Action and deep thought are all a part of the story. Elvis digs deep to keep his relationship with the boy's mom on an even keel, but this may bethe last chance that won't work out. The return of Det. Stangergives us renewed hope that she will be part of Elvis Cole's nextcase and maybe a new romance..."
1,the stitching came apart in the left shoe tongue.,"poor craftship when it came to the stitching. they look an feel good but, they started coming apart an I only wore them slightly."
2,Daigrepont's best album.,"I'm a big fan of Daigrepont, but not always a fan of his albums, which are pretty uneven. When I want to hear him play this is what I put on.A lot of Cajun music is wedded to tradition, but Daigrepont feels free to experiment. ""Bebe de la Famille,"" for example, has a Caribbean touch. ""Bonjour, Dimanche,"" about a farmowner who's been up all night throwing a party and is listening to the countryside wake up at dawn, is the trickiest song here, simultaneously evoking the narrator's bleary state and the farmyard's early-morning bustle. Daigrepont is expanding the tradition, though, not leaving it behind. There's still bouncy party music like ""Tipitina Two-Step,"" a slow one about his uncle's store where you could speak Cajun French and gamble, and covers of songs by Canray Fontenot and Wade Fruge.All of Daigrepont's albums have good songs, but this one's something special. The worst you can say about anything here is that it's merely good."
2,Mind Bomb does just that!!!,"I have such a huge cd collection and I recently went back to listen to some cds I had not given some play in sometime. I cranked up Mind Bomb in the new system and this freakin' cd is so full of great guitar riffs, keyboards, and awesome vox's. It is so unfortunate that it did not get the respected air play in its time. I saw in them ""live"" here in San Antonio when they opened up for Robhalford's ""Fight"" project, and they kicked some ass. I recommend this cd. GET IT!!!!!! if you can find."
2,Great book,I chose this rating because it is so adventurous to me! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes immigration and labor movement. But even if you don't please at least try a sample of the book please!
2,You have to buy good books for your family,It's a very good book for my 13'th daughter. We live in México and the english teachers recomended us to buy this book
2,I think this book is outstanding.,"I'm reading ""Letters From Rifka,"" and I think it is a real interesting book.I think this book is real interesting bacause its a really good mystery book.I mean you never know whats going to happen because Rifka is always getting into something new.THese are reasons why I adore ""Letters From Rifka""."
1,It never arrived,"I paid for it, i need it next week, i've filed a claim, but still no book? How can i review a service when that service was never provided?I will update this review if and when i actually get what i paid for.James McDonald"
2,A95 Disks,"If you use the Canon A95, this disk is all you will need plus some. You will never run out of disk space. I like the ease of use and the large capacity. Chances are that if you are not a pro, the 1mb disk may be too much space and you may only need something smaller like the 512mb."
1,Pricy,"Of course as all things computer related, as soon as this was purchased the price dropped drastically. Unit works great but buy the 2 gig. More bang for the $$"
1,"Slow performance, bad for large megapixel cameras","My main problem with this Compact Flash is that the ""real-time"" performance is very slow. I bought it a year ago for my 5-Megapixel camera, and it makes me wait a long time before I can take my next photo. This gets frustrating when you miss good photo opportunities.Then, I read this article which reviews Compact Flash cards, and I realized that this particular SanDisk product line is inferior.The review at DP Review says this Sandisk writes at 6x (where 'x' = 150 KB/sec). I since then, have purchased a 512MB Transcend compact flash which claims to Write at 25x. My camera works much faster now. I have borrowed my friend's IBM Microdrive and that is really fast too."
2,More phisolophical than technical for sure,"The book provides some clues on how errors should be considered. It spends a lot of time describing the current situation in a very verbose style. OK that's fun but not very instructive (I mean, we all know half the messages are stupid, unfounded, incomprehensible, etc.). This beeing said I would recommend the book for the same reason...."
2,Bulk Soaker Hose Comparison,"Fiskars ceased making bulk soaker hose in 96'. Excellent product and system using there black and yellow compression fittings. I found an online retailer that carries the same product (part #120, .580 bulk soaker hose in 100' 500' rolls) with many more items, hose sizes in there product lineup. It appears they have a new formula as of June of 2010, that works so much like the original Fiskars. The mfg. is [...]"
1,okay but cheap looking,"These earrings are not worth more than the $5 I paid, but they are cute and the company shipped all items promptly. The ""dangle"" part of the earring above the colored beads look like cheap plastic beads stacked on top of each other."
1,It [stinks],"How anyone could think this was scarier than the first is beyond me. It was so [weak]. Freddy was good for one movie okay, no more Freddy, he's dead face it, people don't like scary movies anymore, they like Scream. Horror is diseased. Too the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween I'm sorry. RIP. We will no longer get real horror. We had a peak with The Exorcist, and went down hill from there. The first was scary, the rest [stink]!"
2,A great horror movie:,This is a good movie. I love the nightmare on elm street movies.The last one isn't that good though but it's okay. The older ones are the best because they deal with teens. Patricia arquette plays in this. Buy it.
1,Dwarf Cichlids by david Boruchowiztz,"I was very disappointed by this book. Vague and woolly. It didn't address the specifics needs for breeding Apistogrammas for example. Great pictures, but you can get great pictures free on the net. The quality of the photography is first rate and if you want a book just for browsing occasionally then its fine."
2,An original mix!,"OK, this is an odd mix! but some of the tracks are great! It has everything from the blues to Ska! However, the track which will gain most attention is George Harrison's. Harrison's voice sounds in faltering shape! The Eric Clapton is a good track, and there are many gems in this album!"
2,New Family Favorite!,I was so pleased to find this movie on DVD & at a great price! This movie was one of my most favorites as a child & now I am able to enjoy it with my fiance & kids. It is the perfect level of creepy & mystery for kids to enjoy & not end up terrified.
1,Boot Legged Product ???,"The movie was like a boot legged video... NOT a Disney movie, NO Walt Disney Castle Credit or anything Disney. Beginning scene as I saw when I was younger was missing and you could see blippy black, white and yellow spots on the screen like you would see in an older projection film.No chapter/scene selections or anythingNOT worth the $18 ..."
2,A Christmas Classic,I bought this CD when it first came out and it's still my favorite after all these years. She is at her best on this CD. A winner that is sure to please!
1,Mariah Carey,"MC can't sing: she's just another Whitney Houston imitator whose only entertainment value is showing off her body!The traditional Christmas Carol ""Joy to the World "" track is positively contaminated, no.. blasphemed, by mixing in parts of the 3 Dog Nite song of the same title.In summary, this album SUCKS!!!"
2,This is a must have...even if you have the original!,"Two bonus songs...fantastic. The videos...fantastic.The video for ""O Holy Night""...gives me the chills!The picture is so clear and her performance is flawless.Worth every penny to purchase this CD/DVD.Go now...buy it!"
2,Loved it,Love me some Mariah Carey. This was actually a repurchase of a CD we wore out...had to get a new one.
1,A Bad Bad christmas album.,"This album is so cheesy, it makes me wnat to puke and swallow my own intestines. What was Mariah thinking by producing such vomit-inducing rubbish!!!"
1,"Sappy, childish, commercial...","...no depth at all in this CD. Mariah has no ""angel"" at all. Ridiculous CD. Don't get it."
1,Mariah has proven herself to be an industry tramp.......,"2005 has shown the true side of mariah, and has shown her greed and hatred for her fans. She knows that they will buy anything that has her name on it, and she is effectively exploiting this!!!!mariah is a ho ho ho ho ho ho!!"
1,Legacy Yea Right!!!!!,"Both The Lable & the Band are Guilty of Pissing Down the Leg of One of the true Great american Rock bands, Like The Other truely Great American Rock band (Cheap Trick) we have been bombarded with Cut rate compilations of past glory, What the band really has told it's fans is This, We have nothing Tangible to say we have milked our cow dry But we are not quite done Fleecing you so Give us your money because we spent most of our fortune sticking things In our noses & veins so Give us more money beause we are now addicted to your hard earned Cash. stay away from this & all further released albums by this band until they give us more than Hits or Live compilations or Rehashed Blues numbers from artists who did them better in the first place save you money & buy yourself a Muddy Waters CD or a willie Dixon cd see where these rip off artists bit thier style from in the first place"
2,"Now they saying Ms. before they mention your name, girl!","I feel as though I have been waiting on this CD forever. I have always been a Kelly fan, even back in the day when she with ""Beyonce & the other girls"", also know as Destiny's child.Beyonce has an overpowering voice that at times can get annoying, although I still love her, but Kelly's voice more soft and smooth. This cd showcases her talents as singer as well as a talented writer.After the BET awards, I was a little afraid as to what this cd might sound like, however after listening to the cd, I've decided that I will just chalk up the bad performance to nerves.I can't wait for more from Ms Kelly.Track Listings and ratings.1.Like This - 4/52.Comeback 5/5 One of my favorites3.Ghetto - 4/54.Work - 5/55.Flashback-3/56.Every Thought is You 4/57.The Show- 4/58.Interlude9.Still In Love With My Ex 5/510.Love - 4/511.Better Without You - 5/512.This is Love-3/5I just wish there were more songs!!!"
1,Teach yourself how not to waste money on worthless books.,"Not only did I waste money on this worthless book, I wasted a fortune on trying to sell my home using the advise of this guy. By the time I'm done, what little profit I made will surely go to my attorney to keep the buyers of my home off my back."
2,Great Hardy,"Good book. Hardy's descriptions of astronomy are beautiful. The characters of Lady Constantine and Swithin are well developed, and Swithin's conflict between love and science moves the book.If I have one complaint, the characters apart from Constantine and Swithin aren't as well developed as a book like Far from the Madding crowd. Jan Coggan, the Maltster, and Laban Tall are one of the best parts of Far from the Madding Crowd, and that is missing from this book. The parson is developed, but he's not funny or lively."
2,Another Unhappy Hardy Ending,"If you like Thomas Hardy and unhappy endings, then you will like this book. This Jude the Obscure meets The Return of the Native, but shorter."
2,Greatest movie ever,What can I say? This is my favorite movie. Don't buy it tho unless your a deep thinker that sees lots of depth in zombie movies. Enjoy!!!
1,No.,"This movie makes no sense.The title character is introduced as an immoral zombie-killer, who picks up grieving trophy wife bimbos at the cemetery where he works. Later he transitions into a blubbery psychotic mess over the loss of a chick he knew for two days and didn't even seal the deal with. Only to meet multiples of her, one of whom has a phobia of erections...If you LOVE zombie movies, stay away. The makeup is terrible, the acting is mediocre, plot? What plot? The zombie action is boring. There's no connection with any of the characters and you spend the last 3/4 of the movie hoping everyone dies."
2,"Dark atmosphere, sexy love interest, great gore!!","Having seem my share of zombie flicks I still can't bring myself to seriously consider them fine film making, but Dellamorte Dellamore comes the closest to keeping my interest for the entire screening.Taking place in old cemetary in Italy, Rupert Everett plays a cemetery watchman who matter-of-factly dispatches zombies with the coolness of Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western using his trusty sidearm.I must confess the acting, aside from Rupert's is 'B' movie quality, but I was consistantly drawn into the movie's eerie setsand the antics of baffoonishly sickening sidekick Gnaghi, played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and naturally Anna Falchi is a sight to behold by any standards.The gore effects are above average and serve the story in appropriate quanities.I've not seen other films directed by Michael Sovai but this one makes me hope I do. According to IMDB this is the last movie he's made, apparently not a most prolific director."
1,Extremely Disappointing!,"All of these positive reviews, calling this the greatest movie of all time are way off base. What makes this movie so great? There are tons of Italian Zombie movies out there and a good 95% of them are better than this drivel.After reading all of these reviews calling this a ""classic"" I went in expecting something of an ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Alive"" type of film which are filled with gore and have some nice comedic bits. ""Cemetery Man"" is simply BORING, that's right it BORING! Slowly paced, dim witted and down right JUNK!If you want to see a good Italian zombie flick check out some of Lucio Fulci's work like ""Zombie"", ""City of The Living Dead"" or ""The Beyond"" all superior works compared to this god awful movie. Save yourself about 2 hours of your life and stay away from this extremely boring film."
1,Terrible movie,"This was a total waste of 90 minutes of my life. Terrible, boring, stupid, and senseless don't begin to describe this waste of film. How anyone can rate it 4 or 5 starts is beyond me. I think I'm open minded. I watch horror, slasher, foreign and suspense films all the time. This has nothing going for it. It is NOT scary in the least. And the special effects are about as well done as a high school play. This is just garbage. I would have given it zero stars, but that's not an option."
1,Cemetary Man,"Italians are good at Gore, but fail at plot. The movie plot was all over the place. DO NOT waste you time watching more Italian gory junk!"
1,More of the same,"Yet another movie that presents the psuedo-gospel of ""get right with God so you don't have to go to hell with all the other sinners"". If you've seen left behind, omega code, etc. This is only different in having a smaller budget, smaller plot, and equally bad acting. Someone please start making movies about the life of fullness and great joy that Jesus invited people to rather than another fire insurance movie like this one. How many do we need? Who are they for? I am sure God can use this for His glory and purposes, but I found it rather dissappointing."
2,Christian movie for Anyone. Plus the Rapture.,"The sign of the times are all present and sooner or later the world dictator will make his debut onto the world scene. The movie ""Six"" even though it is a movie is a close representation of what it will be like in a couple of years. Six talks about the Tribulation time in where all people on this earth will have to use a mark on there right hand or forehead in order to buy and sell anything in the market. The cash society will be non-existent. This is a great movie for the Christian person and for the person who does not know Jesus Christ and who wants to, who wants to change to the Christian Religion. People laugh at this time from ever occurring but if you look at the news things are going on which only indicate that the Lord will be coming soon.Pray alot, and hope to get picked up during the Rapture. As for Six the movie, get it, and watch it, and learn from it."
1,continued disappointment,"The author puts forth a ""New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out.'"
2,Excelent book,"I received my book from within 15days insteadof 8 weeks they told me, excelent and i love this item, signed as they said, very nice buy."
1,THE ALBUM THAT ALMOST DESTROYED HELLOWEEN....,"In this album Helloween tried something new, but without a clear direction the album turned out to be a loser, confusing his hard-core fans and gaining almost none new ones."
1,''Why Helloween Why'',This one is nothing compare with the oder helloween albuns.Chameleon and Pink bubles don't have the real heloween music. I prefere the bands new and old albuns.
1,WORST HELLOWEEN ALBUM,"Why can't people recognize the fact that after Kai Hansen left, Helloween was gone for sure ?? See what Gamma Ray is doing and compare it with what Helloween has been doing ... Anyway, I'm not saying that all Helloween albuns after Michael Weikath took control are horrible. But this ""CHAMELEON"" is. It is exactly whjat its name means: a transformation of metal into garbage."
1,Piece of junk,"Helloween almost was destroyed forever after this turkey, who flopped simpkly because it really was that bad. The band tried to ""innovate"", adding a lot of keyboards, horns and whatever, in a mixture of poorly written songs that nobody will ever remember, and that were scrapped forever from their live set. AS a result, singer Michael Kiske and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg were fired (for differente reasons), the band lost their contract with EMI and had to start all over agains, never totally recovered from guitarrist Kai Hansen's loss."
1,Good unit except.....,"As a previous poster already stated this unit only supports up to 2GB SD cards. Unless Philips releases a firmware update for SDHC cards or you have a large supply of 2GB or less SD cards stay away from this unit. Other than this major shortcoming, it's a pretty good device."
2,WONDERFUL ENTERTAINTMENT,"Don't seek any academic insights from this book. This is a piece of pure entertainment, full of memories and anecdotes that can brighten up a hundred dinner tables over the years. Hoveyda was a founder of France's snootiest film review, the Cahiers du Cinema, but writes with the ease and wit of a free spirit. While recalling his friendship with many of the innovative film-makers of the last century, Hoveyda also debunks some of the myths about the New Wave and independent cinema. A READER IN LONDON"
2,Ooooooh my Godddddddddd !!!,"Like most of Betty Carter's albums, this one demands patience, attention, availability. You cannnot appreciate HER music if you want to discover all the riches at once. If you're a man, you got to be a gentleman. It's been three days now that I keep listening to ""It's not about the melody"". I did not want to talk about it, because it's so beautiful... You know what I mean? It's a bit like when you got a beautiful girlfriend, you're not going to yell at everybody that you've got a beautiful girl friend, are you?... See what I mean? ... Huh, what did I say? nothing. OK, I must be going now........"
2,Excellent and forceful,"The stories are of two types here -- short, one page sketches that verge on being prose poems, and longer, fuller stories which still contain an elusive quality. Although critics, to a man, preferred the longer stories, I find the shorter ones equally compelling. The writing is first-rate; it is nuanced, poetic, and contains a wealth of psychological insight. I think this is Phillps's greatest accomplishment: her merging of the psychological and the political in stories that are always accessible. Those looking for pretension will find it only with reviewers who trash sophisticated story-tellers while including the (see more about me) tag at the beginning of their own reviews."
1,Didn't much care for it.,"I didn't much cre for this book. It had too much sex stuff and not really any stories to follow. I thought it would be a good book, too since other well-known authors have praised it so well. I do not see what all the fuss was about."
1,"Say, wha?","Um, can you say one of the worst movies ever? The only man that fell here was me..falling for the price of renting this horrible movie! Lifeless, dreary, and humorless. Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot: A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues. Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone). Stone looks stoned. Stone looks yucky. Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits. No. Maybe it was the awful acting. Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care. But if you want a ""gripping psychological thriller"" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking. What a waste of talent."
2,Lots of good Information and facts.,"This book helps a lot. It teaches you how to train, when to train, what sorts of things you should do, and different foods to eat. This will help you prepare. It is a great purchase."
1,bad to the bone,"this movie sucked, it was better than the dreamchild but the worst one, the deaths were ridiculous and it had to much humour, the ending was a total let down, the fight between Freddy and his daughter was not a big finale, this movie was a waste of my time, and if your looking for a good movie, this is not a good choice, even die hard freddy fans won't like this, even the acting was bad, don't rent this or buy it, worst Freddy movie"
2,"""I'll get you my pretty and your little soul too""","I loved this Nightmare film, this, the 1st one and the 3rd are my top fav 3 out the series.This one has no horror, but it has the most comedy ever, Freddy will make you laugh your ass off in this one.My fav part is when hes playing the video game, so brilliant. And when hes messing with that dude with the ear plug, really cool."
1,Is Freddy dead yet?,Just a typical Freddy sequel that is actually quite good. A few good deaths and wise cracks. Although they seemed to finish Freddy off quite quickly that it would seem like they had another sequel planned.
1,sucked!!!,"this one just stunk overall there is no dought about that. after 5 I thought it couldn't get worse, well it did in this one."
2,Freddy's done it again!,This movie was great. Robert Englund was holarious. The graphics and special effects were great. I thought there could been more body count though. It was a great combination of horror and comedy. I think you should see it.
1,0 STARS: AWFUL!!,"""Freddy's Dead- The Final Nightmare"" is a terrible installment to what was a great horror movie series. This movie is a total joke just like the previous two sequels before it...this garbage, a horror movie?? Give me a break!! This movie is not scary...it's ridiculous!! I highly recommend sticking with parts 1-3, which are undoubtedly the only ""NOES"" movies that should have ever been made. This movie sucks...shame on the people that made this trash."
1,3-D Sequences barely save this sub-par finish to the series,To fully appreciate this film you have to either seen it in the theater or have a DVD player. The 3D sequence is the film's saving glory. The film seems like it was rushed because the script is bland. I think if the film had brought back Wes Craven then maybe it would've been a superior finish to one of the greatest film series in history.
1,Same ol' song and dance,"A friend of mine bought this book and shouldn't have. Laura Schellhardt isn't a seasoned pro at screenwriting, she is a TEACHER. Not a good one at that.Yes, the book is informative, but it doesn't say anything different that any other book does, other than the Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier. Trottier is a professional writer with numerous credits under his belt. So my advice is to ""Schell"" out an extra dollar so you can buy the Screenwriter's Bible and just leave Screenwriting for Dummies alone."
1,Pseudo-science,"Lomborg's book may appear to consist of logical arguments, and therefore appeals to many, but closer examination reveals this not to be the case.I would urge other readers of the book to treat Lomborg's work with the same view to skepticism as Lomborg himself..."
1,Soft targets and biased selection,"This book pays little attention to the peer reviewed scientific literature on environmental problems. That is the basis for policy and has established the seriousness of many environmental problems. In addition to picking ""soft targets"" of writings by advocates, the book ignores inflated claims by industry about the economic losses that will accompany environmental regulation. This demonstrates its lack of balance."
1,Very misleading and shallow,"So many people will believe anything they read if it agrees with their beliefs. This book contains errors and distortions. Unfortunately, the reviewers just add to the confusion. For example:""...government workers faked lynx presence..."" Sorry, it didn't happen. Read the follow-ups, not just the first headline. Visit the Audubon Magazine website for a comprehensive article on the incident.The marine harvest data is flawed. China has been lying about their catches for years. Even the not very left-leaning U.S. News reported that yields have been dropping dramatically. ""Marine sleuths find that faulty numbers from Beijing have masked a worldwide drop in catches"".This book is recommended for the person who wants to refute arguments about environmental problems and doesn't care about accuracy and facts."
1,Outdated and Uneducated,An environmental book written by a statistician! 90% of all statistics can be used to show either side of the argument 50% of the time! This author uses this skill liberally.The first chapter makes a very valid point: be aware of what you're reading and be skeptical! The rest of the book is slanted toward his OPINION and he disregards information that doesn't support his viewpoints.Many things may not be as bad as some portray but they aren't as rosy as this author portrays either. READ WITH SKEPTICISM!!
1,Not the best,"Wether this verson has been updated and cleaned up, doesn't really matter.What I've seen is a very poor recording, very bad sound (that makes it hard to hear what is being said),and bad picture quality.A film from the master of suspence should be given the recognition it deserves."
2,Singing voice that mind gets warm,It is a famous piece of music collection which keeps being eternally heard.
1,ULTIMATE RIP-OFF,"Do not purchase this download. Track 15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds. It may well be in the master, too."
2,Great!,"So many people have never taken him seriously. That's because they have no understanding of talent or superb craftsmanship. A great example is in the one star review below. Sigh. Making fun of him is pretty cliche. It went out of style 20 years ago. Maybe it's time the naysayers grew up a little. People might of made fun of him, but guess what?. 20 some years later and he is still here!. This CD debuted at number 3 on the charts in a world filled with Britneys and Limp Bizkits. Mr. Manilow has definitley gotten the last laugh. The detractors can laugh all you want, but it won't amount to a hill of beans. He proved himself decades and decades ago and is still doing it. Laughing at him is as meaningless as ever."
1,King of Kitsch,"It is unfathomable that here, in the early days of the 21st century, there are still people who not only listen to the King of Kitsch, but will own up to it. There is a reason why Barry Manilow has spent the better part of a quarter of a century being the punchline of jokes and twenty of those reason can be found here. Sappy songs galore, almost all having the same ""beautiful music"" structure of slow tempo throughout each verse and chorus, before ending in a bombastic crescendo. Sadly these songs can still be heard in elevators and dentist offices across America. Even sadder is that people will pay to hear them again at home."
1,MANILOW A HUMPERDINCK WANT TO BE,MANILOW SHOULD JUST HANG IT UP.HE SHOULD GO BACK TO PERFORMING IN BATH HOUSES.BETWEEN A BIG NOSE AND A VERY AUDIBLE LISP THIS GUY CRUCIFIES THE MEANING OF ROMANTIC MUSIC.HE IS A ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK WANNA BE.MAYBE HE CAN GET A GIG SHINING ENGELBERTS SHOES!IF HE IS LUCKY!
1,For Cultural Lemmings Everywhere,"Please! Five stars for a collection of the sappiest songs of all time? It is pretty hard to take seriously someone who claims to have invented music (""I am music and I write the songs"") yet the abundance of five star reviews here proves that PT Barnium was right...."
2,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!",I was so excited when this finally arrived in the mail! I have been listening to it non stop... It certainly takes me back and reminds me of all of the good and special times in my life. This is a great CD with all of the songs you love to sing along with. Enjoy!
1,It's a shame cos it's a good movie..,..between horror and deep emotions with a capital fault:What the hell they think they are in giving us a clear statement against euthanasia??? We are no longer in the middle age I thought.. Even for American standarts this should cause a big scandal!
1,Absolutely horrible,"Absolutely horrible. 1 star at best. What's there not to like? The acting is absolutely horrible. The special effects, especially the make-up, look amateur - the blood (and there is lots of it) looks very fake. Email me if you disagree. I hope I find a buyer for this DVD when I sell it on ebay..."
1,Yawn!,"I thought the plot really dragged in this sappy, semi-scary film about a young women who's frightened of hospitals, but has to go into one to rescue her husband. Of course, in conquering her fears she saves his life, blah, blah, blah. Her husband, meanwhile, discovers that four of the nurses are blood-drinking lesbians in one of the most blatantly stupid scenes in the entire film. Clearly, somebody on the production staff must have realized that this film was a dud and that perhaps by adding a completely unimaginative girl/girl/girl/girl encounter they could somehow save it. But alas, this film is one patient that was beyond saving."
1,Don't even bother - save your money,"The DVD is a dissapointment. Over 1/2 of the music footage is missing.It's a ""tribute"" concert, yet the biggest tribute to Freddie, Extremes medley of Queen songs (which is BY FAR the show stealer) and them performing ""Love of my Life"" w/ Brian May are stricken from the DVD.Do yourself a favor, hunt down the VHS copy. If you threw out your VCR, it's worth buying another one to watch it with."
2,Great Concert,"hearing George Michael do SOmebody to Love was a great Moment on this set.ELton John&Axel ROse Dueting was something special as well.it was a great tribute.Seal,Annie Lennox,Bowie,ETC.. made this a Special COncert."
2,Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert,An awesome concert of superstars as a tribute to one of the greatest vocalist of all time. I still have the original VHS tape and love it. This DVD (finally) is a must for all the fans of Queen and Rock & Roll music.
1,"Smells nice, doesn't last","Smells great...doesn't last that long. Thought it was me, asked others...they all agreed. We couldn't smell anything after a couple of hours. What a waste of money."
2,Loves kitty,"We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old. He absolutely loved it. Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee. He is now 4 1/2 months old and he still likes it, but he does seem to get bored with it quicker and he likes his larger play mat better."
1,boring...,Thought that this was very cute and had many things to do however I think it looks better than it actually is. My daughter really could have cared less about the entire thing. There really is only 4 things hanging down and they really don't go OVER the baby. I think that the entire point of a baby gym is to have the toys over the baby to reach out a grab. This is a total miss.
1,"Do yourself a favour, do NOT buy this book!","Note the worst book in the world, but fairly darn close. I bought three study guides for this exam and the only one that seemed to be helpful was the Coriolis Exam Prep by Talbert. It got a bit detailed in parts but was the clear winner of the three I read."
2,great scary movie from wes craven!,"I find this movie very well done, it has a lot of scenes that would probably at least make you a little bit scared. This film has good acting by Heather Langenkamp(Nancy Thomson) and Johnny Depp(Glenn) and by Robert Englund(freddy). If you are in the mood to watch a horror film then this is one film that you should not miss"
2,Iconic slasher flick,"This is it. The film that introduced the world to Horror icon Freddy Krueger. Of course Freddy wasn't the ONLY slasher in the '80s (with Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees), but to me, Freddy is the absolute best! There are plenty of moments that'll make you jump out of your seat and there are also some just plain downright disturbing moments. If you're a fan of slasher flicks then this movie is definitely a must-see!5 stars/5"
2,One of the best horror movies of all time,"Fred Krueger, a psychotic child murderer that was torched in his boiler room by the enraged parents of elm street. Ten years later he returns and this time he slashes kids in their dreams. This movie is fun and entertaining, no doubt Wes Craven's best movie. Unfortunately it had to be followed by a couple of try hard sequels."
2,The beginning of your nightmares!,"This is the first Nightmare on Elm Street and it rocks! How many people out there have been scared by Freddy? Millions! In the movie Freddy attacks you in your dreams, and he makes your life miserable. I first watched this movie when I was seven and it scared the living daylight out of me! Ofcourse going to sleep is hard after you watch this movie cause you think Freddy is after you, and he is.... nah, Im just kidding. So anyways, if you want to enjoy a good movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street is the one, I mean, look at all the sequels it has, its a great flick!"
2,SENUOUS AND SENATIONAL FROM START TO FINISH,"I LOVE THIS MAN AND HIS WAY WITH A SONG. SMOOTH AND FLUID; FILLED WITH PASSIONATE AND POETIC LYRICS.LISTEN TO ""BUT BEAUTIFUL"", THE CLASSIC JOHNNY BURKE BALLAD. IT LEAVES A LUMP IN THE THROAT.LUCIEN TAKES HIS TIME AND IT'S A PLEASURE!"
2,Very Interesting View of The Future,"I really liked this book, although there were some parts to it that I didn`t understand. The author creates a future world, where humans are genetically engineered to ""be happy"". I think the idea behind this book is to point out some of the weaknesses of our society (eg. our reluctance to face our problems - we tend to take some ""soma"" instead, which is a widely used drug in the book to make people forget their problems)and to make us aware of what could happen in the future to humanity if we aren`t careful. The future described in the novel is very realistic and some of it is already starting to show up - whether we like it or not. When reading the book, you get the feeling (or maybe you don`t) that something is wrong with this future world. Engineering people to work and be happy is wrong, because the happiness they are feeling is not real. I guess it doesn`t make any sense now, but after reading the book it gives you something to think about. A great book!"
1,Hmm...,"I don't get it. It's very unusual. Controversial in its time, but still widely read throughout schools in the United States. I must say it wasn't all bad, the ideas he portrayed were revolutionary and original, although I was extremely let down at the end. It is clever that drugs aren't for pleasure anymore, they are everyday, for the use of increasing entertainment. That's how someone explained their interpretation, but I still [dislike] my English teacher for making me read it. It just seemed as if I was being led to believe one thing throughout, expecting some kind of epiphany, but got a guy walking in circles at the top of the stairs..."
1,I expected so much more from such a high-rated novel,"I was so enthusiastic and worked up to expecting a splendid and original read, but came off greatly dissapointed and got frustrated trying to think of what all the hype was about with BRAVE NEW WORLD. I tried so very hard to like and enjoy reading this...but my mind just didn't want to cooperate. Such a complex and creepy look into a superfical world into this book was hard to grasp, this just wasn't the type of book I expected. I prefered 1984 and Animal Farm much more than Brave New World. I mean, it's hard to say that emotions can errupture with just a little pill, and vice versa. Oh well, maybe I'm a bit tuff to give such a beloved classic just 1 star, but that's what I deeply and truely think this book deserves. I'll stick to my old favorites: Eliot, Hardy, Orwell, Willa Cather, Wharton, Dreiser, and Gustave Flaubert. Hehe, I never get to tired of my favorites. Viz., I didn't like this classic."
1,The ultimate in idiocy,"A world where nobody is unhappy... this is supposed to be a bad thing in Huxley's story. What nonsense.I find it strange that Huxley supposedly had any affinity towards buddhism... The ultimate goal in buddhism is the ending of suffering... other things... freedom, love etc... are unimportant next to this. To say that you want to ""keep the right to be unhappy"" (as one of the characters in the book says) is the most unbuddhist thing anyone could say...What stupidity... taking pride in your ability to be unhappy..."
1,Doesn't fulfil even the lowest requirements for fiction,"I don't understand why Mr. Huxley is so famous. Okay, he has a very strong message, but then, his writing skills are non-existent. This book completely lacks fantasy and originality. As a result, the possible appeal of Mr. Huxley's ideas is overweighed in a hundredfold by the despise his ""prose"" (sorry for using this word here!) makes you feel. How is one supposed to enjoy the beauty of a wonderful landscape by a scribble of a three-year-old? Instead of this ""novel"", Mr. Huxley should have written a short newspaper article titled ""Things I Don't Like"".If Mr. Huxley is a writer, anybody who talks is a linguist. Reading this book leaves one perplexed - how could the author voluntarily expose himself to such ridicule?"
2,"into medialis they do go, yes",there were corollary tendency. without sshining light the new generation do you? uh?
2,Great Classic,"This book is a great classic of Sci-Fi, couldn't put it down read it in two days and was very engaging."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Brave New World has many thought-provoking ideas. To dream up an utopia in Huxley's time is genious, but the story is not. I read this story for eighth grade, and though it had some things that i'm sure no one had ever thought of before then, they have now. It's not good enough to have a good ides, you have to write well, too."
2,Pleasently Surprised,"I picked this book up at a rummage sale to add to my little library of books. I didn't plan on reading it for quite awhile... until I learned that this book was banned when it was first published in 1932. This is scifi at it's best. There is a lot of scientific information, but not so much that the reader has to re-read every single paragraph to figure things out. There is a very easy to follow story with some great turns, interesting characters, and a picture that is built for the mind to see. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 17 due to the sexual nature of the book, but I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a really interesting read."
1,1984 was much more enjoyable...,"A decent book, but compared to 1984, this book was not that good. Orwell's 1984 was much more enjoyable to read whereas, at times, I felt lost with Brave New World. The line between protagonist and antagonist seemed blurred throughout this book until the end. Perhaps I should read it again to better understand the plot, but overall, I thought 1984 was a better read."
1,"open your eyes, read it, THEN THROW IT AWAY","BNW a novel with many labels: utopian, dystopian, sci fi, a metaphor of the present, a warning of the future, a great book, a companion to 1984...I only half read it in high school. I don't think it should be part of standard curriculum, just as I don't think Fahrenheit 451 should be. Huxley and Bradbury's bursting desire to make the world aware of the disorienting menace of media and information control is wasted on adolescents.The book IS thought-provoking, though I wish it had been a short story. As such it would never as been as popular: the characters ARE interesting, but Huxley relies upon THEM to explain everything. The only descriptions are left to them, and as storytellers, they all fall far short of extraordinary.This is not a world I would want to live in.And 1984 is better written."
2,Best Negative Utopia I've read (And Yes I read 1984),"I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the greatest books I ever read. Everyone already commented on the glimpse of the future...chilling totalitarianism, yada yada yada...I'd love to give you a complete analysis of the book, but it's 10:30 and I'm tired. THe story is thourougly engaging, kept me enticed until the end...kind of expected it, but in another sense it cought me completely off guard...it was a masterpiece...better than 1984, which, while quite cool, struck the reviewer(I have to refer to myself in the third person once per review...it's policy :)) as a bit dry and tedious."
2,An ominous warning of a possible future. A must read!,"Aldous Huxley grips the mind, and keeps you locked to this book as he describes a future, one which is completely homogenius and conformed. Practices like artificial conception and genetic tampering are the standard in this uniform society, where very few choices are allowed, and questions are rarely heard. Huxley skillfully describes this gloomy premonition in incredible detail, and in many instances, including artificial insemination and genetic altering, he predicted the actual future. If it does nothing else, this book should send an ominous signal to today's society.This book is a must read!<BR"
2,Fantastic light,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thinks it's the best headlamp he's ever used. He's amazed at the long battery life and the bright lite. We live in the Cascades and he uses it all the time either for work or even to get firewood at night.
2,Great reliable headlight!,I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice. I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use. The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber. I can't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You can't go wrong for the money.
2,good light,"Super light, cant even feel it on your head. also good because you can clip it to your hat too. 2aa batteries, better than most compact lights which require 3aa. bright enough to do any working task. highly recommend it."
2,Good book for beginners,"The book raises a lot of issues that need to be dealt with in designing a web site. This is not a book on how to create a web page. A lot of the material in the book is common sense, but good as a refresher. The book is well written and easy to read."
1,Slow and obvious,"This book may be OK if you've just been put in charge of an intranet and have never used the web before. If you have spent more than a week surfing the internet in your life, you will feel, as I did, that this book states and restates the blindingly obvious ad nauseum. I actually failed to finish this book, I found it so terribly dry and unenlightening. Another thing that really bugs me about it is that the authors pose question after question, but never really supply an answer. Sometimes they make tentative suggestions that this-may-work-then, but never many good examples. They also reference screenshots of one little area of a given website, but this doesn't work because (if you believe the basic premise of the book) a website is a coherent item, not a distinct set of pages. Therefore highlighting specific elements of a website out of context is meaningless. Better spend your time surfing the web and thinking for yourself why some sites work and some don't."
1,Waste if time; waste of money,"I should start by saying I didn't read the whole book. That's because I found it insulting that we were to believe this was a true biography. I resented the author passing off what he thought Gene Kelly must have been thinking during the AFI awards, I disliked the author painting Gene Kelly as mean-spirited and shallow. It was maddening to have the beginning of every chapter fractured with this conjecture. I considered this a total waste of money. Although I freely share my books with others, this book has been consigned to the role of doorstop."
2,Great country/rock,"Excellent product with great vocals. We do a fast line dance to ""Dance"". Great CD with lots to like!"
2,"Good, Quality Cable","I have used this cable for a few years for recording my Casio electronic piano onto my computer and I love it. Once you set it up for the first time, it is quick and easy to use with a nice sound quality."
2,Every Christian should read this book!,"The church has not acted with love toward the Jewish people. This book explains why we, as Christians, should be more appreciate of them and why we owe them a debt of gratitude. Be prepared to learn a lot!"
2,Babylon & Ting,"OK, so everyone already knows the reputation that this early orb effort carries, tracks such as OOBE and Blue Room are widely recognised as chill-dub classics. The fact is that this album is the epitomy of what makes the orb, the orb....The songs are long and consist of layoured soundscape backdrops for dub rhythms and drifting samples. This album is an extremely accomplished work, which changes tempo, style and even volume with no flaw as you move through the tracks.Blue Room is a favourite track of mine and I wish I had the single, Wobbles bassline adds to the track immensely. Towers of Dub follows it and gives the listener an insight into the orb's sense of humour (you need to have seen Victor Lewis-Smith's TV work) which is black at the best.If you have [the money] in your pocket and your in a music store knowing that this is the only album you will ever buy, go on - endulge me and try this."
2,Space Dub,"This is it - the ""Blue Room"" space-ambient extravanganza from the Orb. Great free-ranging basslines traverse the unknown while little voices whisper in our ears. The second CD contains several outstanding ""Blue Room"" versions. SO sweet."
1,"Boring, but not the worst in the series","If you're a fan of the NOES series, you'll probably end up seeing this one, but let me tell you, it's the same plot they've been using since the original. It's sad. To the point: to rate this movie is hard, but all you have to do is compare it to the rest of the series, and compared to #5: The Dream Child, it's way better. Don't be fooled, this is still a real bore!"
2,PURE EVIL NEVER REALLY DIES!,"Proving there's no rest for the wicked,the unspeakable,evil Freddy Krueger(RobertEnglund)is again resurrected from the grave to wreak havoc upon those who dare to dream.But this time,he faces a powerful new adversary!As her friends succumb one by one to Freddy's wrath,telephathically gifted Kristen(TuesdayKnight) embarks on a desperate mission to destroy the dream stalker and release the souls of his victms once and for all.After Kristen gets killed her friend Alice(LisaWilcox)is the world's only hope.Alice now has Kristen's powers she is a DREAM MASTER.After Alice's friends start to die including her older brother,Alice prepares to fight the deadly killer for the last time.After Alice kills Freddy she goes home to her boyfriend. But is he really dead?WELCOME TO WONDERLAND ALICE! Rated R brief nudity,violence,and language."
1,Not easy to dance to,I was so disappointed with this dance video! It is so confusing and not fun at all. She will say in the video now go to your right and she is going left and I don't know which way to go. When she says dance to the left she is going to the right. They should have done this video in front of a mirror. Big disappointment.
1,garden gnome,"A real let down the pictures look so good, but in reality they are very small and get lost outdoors in a garden setting, the plants overwhelm them, good price but they are not very practical"
1,Only the obvious copied and pasted,This book I found rather disappointing. It is DEFINITELY for the beginner. So much that most information is nearly copied from all the help information provided during the installation process itself.If you are a beginner I would not recommend buying this book. Look for something else!!
1,Penelope lays an egg,"Fans of the original Hal Roach series should be outraged at this piece of junk, which is highly overrated at even one star. The cast of look-alike children are completely devoid of talent, the script is wretched, and the direction is even worse. P.U.!!"
2,A great movie for kids,"The Little Rascals (1994), *****, starring Travis Tedford, Kevin Jamal Woods, Jordan Warkol, Zachary Mabry, Ross Bagley.I first saw this movie on the exclusive Starz On Demand service that came with Comcast Cable. I love the Little Rascals and that is my main reason for watching it again and again. In the movie, I love how there's every main movie genre--excluding science-fiction and fantasy and animation. There's romance when Alfalfa (Bug Hall) woos his words of love to his young soulmate Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). There's drama when Waldo interferes in the budding, inseparable relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. There's comedy when Alfalfa goes about half-naked when he undresses from the ballerina costume and when Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins). There's plenty of action during the cross-city go-kart race. That's the best part of the whole movie. I recommend this film for male and female, young and old. There's everything for everybody."
2,Best Kids Move Ever,I've never seen any child who didn't want to watch this move at least twice if not three times.
1,disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed and caught very off guard by this book. I completed this book with a women's group and couldn't believe the point of view. I felt like the book expected and told women that they should be ""June Cleaver"". Very disappointed in the message that women should have no say so in anything and just fall to the feet of their man. Also, I did not understand how this book's message was in any way the message given in the bible as to what a wife should strive to be."
1,Very statistical,I was kind of dissapointed with this material. It only talks about statistics... more like a thesis or something...Was hoping something more conductual-psychological oriented.
1,Be A Doormat For A Man's Ego,"The entire book was about stroking a man's ego at the expense of anything the woman may want.You have to submitt yourself towalking on eggs in order to keep his ego full of pride.Isn'tpride a sin? This book is not helpful,the book will cause thewoman to second guess herself."
2,So interesting!,This has been a very interesting read. I purchased it because I just started dating again after 27 years of marriage and the death of my hubby. I have 3 boys and lots of men in my life and never knew some of the things I learned here! I suggest this for all women.
2,fun,nothing but fun freddys one libners genious his kills bizzre gross and inhuman the actings great aspecialy by alice freddy and her frien yolonda.
1,And they continued the series because why?,"Nightmare on Elm Street, A: The Dream Child (1989) Robert England, Lisa Wilcox, Erika Anderson, Valorie Armstrong, Michael Ashton, Kelly Jo Minter, Whitby Hertford, Danny Hassel, Beatrice Boepple, D: Stephen Hopkins.In the fifth installment, the nightmarish dream-stalker Freddy enters the dreams of survivor Wilcox's unborn child, attempting to place the souls of those he killed into the fetus, and enjoys his favorite pastime by going after her friends. Again, bizarre effects are the only pro here, but the movie's a bust. They saved the worst for last, but it's followed by FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.Running Time: 89 minutes and rated R for language and gore/violence."
1,Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,"The second to worst film in the series. Not that good. Kind of boring with hardly any death scenes or comedy. Starring: Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Danny Hassel, Erika Anderson and Kelly Jo Minter."
1,The new Vhs and Dvd version is terrible,"This version of Nightmare on Elm Street is so terrible.Where's the special features at either on this new Vhs or Dvd there's no deleted scenes like the uncut vhs version.Dan's motorcycle scene was more graphic his face was ripped off and a needle stabs his abck,and Greta's death was longer Freddy cuts her stomach and feeds her own livers.There should be a new Vhs or Dvd version of the uncut version."
1,A sore dissapointment,"Freddy [Robert Englund] returns to haunt alice [Lisa Wilcox] and her friends once more. But this time, Alice is pregnant with a boy and Freddy is using her unborn son to haunt her. As this is all going on, Freddy continues his rampage on those around her and it's again up to Alice to find a way to stop Freddy. This is one of the worst movies in the series [Behind only Nightmare 2], Mainly because of the weak storyline. There is, However, A rather insightful subplot which involves Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger. The film's gothic tone could've been very beneficial to this film [If it only went with a better story!]. The acting is bad and the movie seems as if it has no genuine thrills to offer and therefore, It runs out of steam very quickly. If you want a good Freddy movie, Look elsewhere! Followed by Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare."
1,who could expect anything from this mess?,"this, like the entire nightmare on elm street is another dull, silly and boring excuse for a movie. No one should expect anything but boredom from this."
2,good read about write,"There are many good photographs and tasty tidbits in this fascinating glance at the writing inspirations behind our favorite songs. A little of it must necessarily be speculation, but it is thoroughly researched. One question: where did he get the drawing that inspired ""Lucy In The Sky..,"" and is it authentic? He doesn't give a source."
2,Love this film--and the blu-ray looks spectacular.,"One of my top ten favorite films, Polanski and the spot-on cast made one for the ages with this one...and I was really knocked out at how good the new HD version looked. Really wonderful to see a film of this age look like it was shot yesterday...Now I just want ""The Last Picture Show"" to get the same treatment, and I'll be happy :)"
2,As Close to Perfect Film Noir as one can get,"Early Jack Nicholson is edgy and powerful, and Faye Dunaway is an absolutely superb emotional wreck, in this examination of evil, and the limits to our ability to combat it. The surprise climax is very, very powerful."
1,"Fine performances, but...","Watchable for the performances, but wildly overrated, as is nearly every Polanski film. ""LA Confidential"" probably could not exist if ""Chinatown"" hadn't, but the truth is ""Confidentail"" is everything this film isn't. Now if we could have just time-morphed Nicholson and Dunaway into ""Confidential..."""
2,Great job again Anchor Bay!!! This 4-DVD Gallagher Set rules!!!,"Great job Anchor Bay Entertainment!!! This great 4 DVD set includes 14 great Gallagher shows,very funny stuff indeed,Gallagher is a very unique and one of a kind comedian!!! So if you love Gallagher,this set is quite a bargain,the animated slipcover is also very cool,when you open it up a cardboard Gallagher smashes a cardboard watermelon,sort of like a kids pop up book!!! It's Sledge-O-Matic!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
2,tops,"We have had a cake pan like this for over 38 years and everytime we use it my husband always said he wanted another. So, when I found this I COULDN'T WAITE TO ORDER IT. It's great for holding bar-b-que meat in as will as baking. And with the metal lid you can stack other dishes on top in the frig."
2,great,I had been looking for a cake pan with a metal lid for awhile to replace my old one... this is so great I ended up buying 3 and giving them away....you won't go wrong buying this..
2,"Exactly that ""An American Coup""","Really gives good insight on what really happened as opposed to what we were told on that fateful day. You may believe all, some, or maybe none at all but it gives you a lot to think about. Fascinating."
1,Add us to the negative list.,"When we rented it, we believed the people who had given 5 stars. After viewing, 1 star is stretching it. I won't repeat, just read the 1 star reviews and believe."
1,stupid people who only listen to those that agree,"These Idiots wouldn't know a conspiracy if it were to kill them personally. The only thing this movie shows is how easily led some people are. If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would."
1,Loose brains,"Watch the documentary that was aired on the National Geo or Discovery channel of experts looking into the claims made in this video and they explain it all and conclude that the planes brought it down. But you arm-chair experts know more, bull crap.The floors of the towers were made of concrete, which were VERY heavy, just a few weakened steal beams as seen on the news is all it would take. The weight of the upper floors on those beams caused the upper floors to come crashing down upon the floor that was hit and caused a domino effect of ever increasing weight that just smashed the towers.Use some brains people."
2,Better than I thought,"I watched this a couple of days ago. It was funny, and a bit on the ""creppy"" side, but it was great. I'm glad I took the advise and watched it. Existential crisis at its best!"
1,Even the lead actress couldn't figure out this movie,"Unique beauty Emmanuelle Devos led me here (seeRead My Lipsto understand why), but 'La Moustache' is a hard movie to like despite another winning performance by this beguiling actress. While suspenseful, the movie is ultimately infuriating because like another recent French release,Cache (Hidden), not only is the viewer unable to figure it out, turns out the actors are unclear on the concept as well. Indeed, in the ""Making Of"" featurette included on the DVD, Ms. Devos literally shrugs her shoulders and admits to giving up on figuring out the movie and simply focusing on her role. Moreover, director Emmanuel Carrère and writer Jérme Beaujour tell featurette viewers that they reviewed the first cut of the film and realized that they needed to chop out the explanatory scene (hopefully the one that lets on whether it's the wife or the husband that's gone off the deep end). Maddening."
1,An exercise in futility.,This film is like two films in one. The first half of the movie (in France) is wonderfully taut and suspenseful. We wonder about the motives of the characters. The second half (in Macau) is filmed like an amateurish indy film. The ending is a frustrating exercise in disappointment and need to be explained away only by watching the interview with the director (on the DVD). I borrowed the book to compare the endings and think the book ties up the loose ends better. All in all a rather frustrating and meaningless movie after the suspense in the beginning.
2,Another good Ahern story,I have liked Aherns characters every since his survivor series. The series also has some good characters and action. Kind of a fun read.
2,Freaks,"Even people jaded by the extreme ""realism"" of the 21st century will be shocked by this one. I don't think any mainstream film maker today would have the guts to film this without some sort of political or socially correct manipulation. The story itself is rather pedestrian - opportunistic beauty takes advantage of besotted midget, and runs afoul of his friends. The action takes place in an old time circus, complete with the freaks that are no longer de riguer. The shocker is that few special effects are used, and the freaks are played by themselves. The result is a film with less of the 30s Hollywood melodrama, and a more realistic portrait of people who are physically different - some tragically disfigured. I found the experience moving and harrowing at the same time."
1,Good music,It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
1,Damaged goods... Pay attention to vendor name.,"The item was damaged, and previously a returned item. Half of the wire top was not attached.Guessing from the vendor name and the fact that this was a previously opened item, I believe it was a defective item. The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items... fool me once... never again!"
2,Excellent guidebook for visitors to the Old City,"If you have the time needed to follow the guidance in this book, you will find it to be a most worthwhile purchase. Although several years old, it's still new enough to lead the way through the various revelations that one can find in the Old City of Jerusalem."
2,The Consummate Traveller,"Just when I think I've written a great travel story, I go read Palin and remind myself how it's done. I just love his incredibly obtuse descriptions and attention to unimportant detail. To read this, or any of his books, is to travel side-by-side with Palin as if a companion. I raise my glass to you."
2,Must see for fans of traveling shows,Michael Palin provides an offbeat and interesting documentary of his trip from the North Pole to the South Pole. This video makes you wish you could have gone with him!
2,sucked in.,"I found this book to be one of the best in the Anita Blake series. For me, it started off a bit slow but quickly sucked me in. I don't want to give up any details, but the wonderful detail of the 'fight' scenes, the tension between Anita and Jean-Claude, and everything in between makes this out to be a very good read."
2,Circus of the Damned,"If you loved Ann Rice you will love laurell Hamilton. Read thenm in order, this one is #3."
1,The Decline of Our Gang,"Do not confuse the 52 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shorts with the classic comedies produced by Hal Roach Studios. When Roach sold Our Gang to MGM in 1938, the creative spark quickly diminished until the series became unwatchable. Apart from the initial 1938-39 shorts (highlighted by ""The Little Ranger,"" ""Aladdin's Lantern,"" ""Men in Fright"" and ""Alfalfa's Aunt""), these one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts. Spanky, Buckwheat and the gang were badly served by MGM's joyless, heavy-handed approach. On the plus side, the DVD set features excellent and uncut 35mm prints - which cannot be said for the sloppy RHI/Genius ""Little Rascals"" collection."
1,Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy,"I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from 1938 are OK, then MGM trashes the series beyond recognition. Though Hal Roach stopped producing comedy shorts for economic reasons, it must have pained him to see what Leo the Lion did to his beloved property. If you are truly an Our Gang completist, then consider Roach's ""Hide and Shriek"" the grand finale."
2,One hell of a businessman,"Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners."
1,This is what killed my ear for music.,"Not trying to piss anyone off, this is my personal opinion after years of torture with this music. I HATE THIS CD AND STILL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST MY MOM FOR MAKING ME LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE! Its not that I hate folk music, I love folk music (I love all music) and lovely people like Judy Collins and even early stuff by the seegers but half of these songs are off key and its twangy and horrible training for any young ear. Let your kids listen to real music please and not stupid kiddy versions that if they have any intelligence they will know are beneath them. You aren't doing your children any favors by buying them this crap. I'm sure there's some redeeming value because some people like this but I just cannot see it."
2,I love this,"I love this. My children have all loved it. It's just great, authentic folk music, easy to listen to, easy to sing, easy to apply to whatever you might be doing. The way folk music ought to be."
2,Good Book for Experienced Test Takers,"Buy this book if you already have substantial experience with NT4 and Windows 2000 and you need help passing the MS tests. I passed the monster 70-240 with this book. The ""On the Exam"" tips were especially helpful. Also, the ""In the Real World"" comments were very entertaining."
2,Antidote for a bad mood,"Natalie MacMaster's music will lift your spirits any time, but don't miss a chance to see her perform onstage. She is a terrific entertainer as well as a masterful musician."
1,"""The Reaping"" should have been called ""The Sleeping""...","because that was what I was doing after a few minutes of watching this Cardinal Sin being called a movie.If at confession you're given penance by your priest to do a thousand ""Our Fathers"" or to say the Rosary a hundred times, then count your blessings that he didn't force you to watch this movie just one time. Perhaps there truly is a place called Hell, because I felt like I was there for an hour and a half.This movie could have been so great, given the genesis of the story and staring Hilary Swank, one of the best actresses of our day, but it ended up being a complete mess. Even the quality of the blu-ray transfer was terrible.Please save your $19, or go buy ""Seven"" (which deals with this genera brilliantly), ""28 Days Later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", or ""The Skeleton Key"", which are all far superior films that you will enjoy time and time again.Happy movie watching :)"
1,Of Interest to Preteen Girls,"Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read! But, of course, I've never been a little girl, the target audience for this story. It reads like a diary, without the ""Dear diary, ..."" part a nd covers Jane's life - as imagined by young Charlotte. I only read it for a literature class."
2,Excellent rendition,"Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book."
1,What a piece of crap,The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque.
2,The best book I have ever read!,I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week. When i first picked up this book i felt i would not beable to finish it because of my ablity to get bored really quick. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I got in trouble in 2 classes because i had been reading it under my desk until i reached a point (which was very rare) that i could put it down. I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone! I keep on going back in the book to a part i liked best or a place in the story that captivates me. It seems i will never grow tired of this book. I hope all that have read it feel the same!
2,My All-Time Favorite Book,Jane Eyre is a wonderful masterpiece! I absolutely love it. The characters are so well drawn that you become one with Jane and everything she feels and endures. Mr. Rochester has to be the greatest male figure in literature! Move over Heathcliff! I got goosebumps by the end of the book and wanted to immedietly flip it over and begin again.
2,The best book I'll ever read!,"This book is a wonderful story. It is a real page-turner. I couldn't put it down. Charlotte Bronte does awesome discriptions. I recomend this book to everyone who likes most classics. I wish people still wrote books this good. I guess you could call this book a trying-to-find-your-place-in-the-world story. Jane is totally amazing! Even if I am only 11, I can understand what Ms. Bronte is talking about."
2,"You'll either love it or hate it,",I was given this boom to read over the summer for school. I saw how thick it was and I thought oh-mi-god!! I read the first 2 chapters and could not get into it. But by the time I reached chapter 5 I couldn't put it down.It's one of those books you'll either love or hate.
2,Jane Eyre,"This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances."
2,"A ""Regular People"" Review","OK, I'm no smarter than you are, and I read Jane Eyre and thought it was great. The book has so many themes to it, its not just about love, or money, or whatever- a lot of things are touched on. The main character is someone you'll never forget, just as I write this I'm mentally going over the book and I have that warm feeling in my stomach, thats how I know its a great book, so read it..... and keep me updated!"
2,Jane Arrogant,"Jane Eyre, a woman with courage, with passion, with determination, demonstrates a remarkable amount of pride while she lives her life. Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world. Jane Eyre shows how one can mature in to the person that they will be for the rest of their life. Because of this book, my life has been enlightened with good morals and I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
2,Wonderful!,"The introduction includes a dedication and thanks to William Makepeace Thackery, author of Vanity Fair. Bronte and Thackery both admired the enormous capability of women even if not recognized by nineteenth century society. Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!"
2,Beautiful classic!,"I just finished reading this for the first time. I'm so happy I did. It's a great read, albeit a long read but worth the time spent."
1,Jane Eyre review,It was boring and filled with doodoo and i didnt like it at all and it sucks and i hate jane
1,cheap paperback,"Classic novel, great price but the print is from the top to bottom of page and very unappealing to read!"
2,My favorite book!,"I am 14 and I love this book!!!! I have read it 2 times and could read it again. This book is my favorite book ever, it held my attention all the way through(unlike the Jane Austin books which I like, but take a while to get instering). This is definalty the best romance I have ever read! Let me finish by saying I read it once as soon as i finished I was like man I should read it again, not much latter I was going for a long car ride so I did, and as soon as I finished it I thought the same thing, and I would have but my grandma wanted to read it(and this is such a great book that I had to let her read it beacuse everyone at least once should read it). One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre)."
1,The most BORING book in the world!,"I am writing this because I just had to read the book as a requirement for English. It is the worst book in the world, and it drags on and on and on. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who likes action, mystery, or high paced books. If you want to be bored out of your mind, sure, go ahead and read it. Don't say I didn't warn you! If you ask me, sparknotes are the best thing for this book."
2,Jane Eyre,"Enjoyable read! Did not read this while growing up, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing as well as the story. Refreshing!"
2,Jane Eyre Still on Top,"I loved Jane Eyre in high school and I still do now.The heaviness of the Victoria description, while way too heavy for me in books such as The Scarlett Letter, were much more comprehensible and approachable in Jane Eyre. I loved the character development in the book. And the story line of course, from rags to riches, had you rooting for Jane all the way. Adversity turns aside and she lives out her life in happiness and love. A wonderful story!"
2,It made me love to read!,"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie."
2,A Bront Sister's Masterpiece,"When I was looking through the books at the High School Library, the librarian, Ms. Pimentel, asked me if I was looking for anything in particular. I replied that I was not and she said to me, ""Every girl from the age of nine and up should read Jane Eyre."" I asked her to show me where the book was. It looked terribly boring but I wasn't about to say, ""I'm not interested."" So I took it. That night, I read through half of it. I couldn't help it--I was not able to put it down! What would happen to Jane next? Questions would race through my head and so I wouldanswer them myself by continuing to read. I finished it the next night. Ms. Pimentel was right. Every girl SHOULD read Jane Eyre."
1,"Slow moving, feminist book.","I thought this was one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. Mainly focused on ""romance"" and unappearant drama. The ending to this book is also very predictable, I won't say it here because that will give it away. If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy ""love"" novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap. The only reason I can find that this novel my even be remotely considered a classic is because it was written by a woman and it is Victorian."
2,Jane Eyre: I was missing out by skipping the end.,"I tried to read Jane Erye in college, but I didn't budget my time well and didn't get to the end of the book before I had to take the test over it. Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture ""if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out."" Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about."
2,A job well done,This book is one of or the best that I have read in a long time. The writer of the book did an excellent job creating and evoking a variety of feelings within me. I am glad I read this book and I hope you will be too.
2,"Good, solid copy","Jane Eyre is my very favorite book, and this is the copy I'll pass down to my grandchildren. It's aesthetically pleasing, and I'm sure it will hold together for many years. No arguing over the price, either. Thank you, B&N!"
2,A Great Edition of a Classic Novel,"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up. Dame Darcy brings the Gothic elements to life in her illustrations with an artistic flourish. I love these illustrations! They both complement the novel and are great on their own. This book was great to have on hand in class discussion on Jane Eyre and gothic literature.The text of this copy is the second edition of Jane Eyre with it's great preface by Bronte. It is a wonderful novel."
1,Too small,"I did not realize the ""collector's library"" edition of this book would be so small - almost too small to read."
1,Vintage Classics Edition--proceed with caution.,"I just received this Vintage Classics edition of Jane Eyre, chosen for the striking red cover, only to discover that 50 pages are missing (251-298). There is nothing more frustrating than being caught up in a wonderful book and having to come to a screeching halt because of a manufacturer's error, especially since this was my first time reading Jane Eyre."
1,"True love is blind *well, it is for Jane, anyway*","Bronte shows through Jane that sex is Not one of woman'snecessities. Rochester is ugly, but he has a mind. I wish all womenwere of this opinion."
1,The book never came,"The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back."
2,Nice classical read,"This is another good classic I had to read for Literature by Women in college. Following Jane's life is sad, yet interesting. It takes some good twists and turns. Recommend reading it!"
1,Bootleg Version,"I'm sure Raintree County is a grand film, that's why I wanted to watch it. Unfortunately I was unable to watch the film due to bad quality of the picture. I think I know what happened there. All the original prints must have been lost because this picture looks like someone has had put a little cheap camera in front of a TV screen and recorded it from the VHS version of it. Even worse, the camera wasn't focused properly and the white balance must have been way off. On the other hand the picture on the cover of the DVD is blurred, so I guess no one can accuse the producers of unscrupulousness and dishonesty! Problem is I bought this online so I had no idea."
2,Incredible energy,"I don't know how Jimmy Sturr does it. CD after CD, the energy level is amazing. He always includes a cajun number or two, in this case Cajun Fiddle, and a country track, this time Big Ball's in Cowtown. He's so prolific that, on track 12, he tells he Can't Afford to Be a Star. I hope that's not true, Jimmy."
1,"Nice try, but...","This book is a sincere attempt to deal with the incredible mess of LINUX networking. It's better than nothing. It has a lot of useful information. It also has a lot of typos and misstatements and turgid descents into pure confusion. It needs summary sections covering ""all the things required to..."" and a serious troubleshooting guide."
2,My son loves it,"Great toy for my 9 month old. I couldn't even get it wrapped for Christmas! My son chews on it because he is teething, defiantly not meant to be chewed on but I still love it :]"
2,Absoutely Wonderful,Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week. Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years. Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points. Not any more. My new best friend the Back Buddy can do all and more that was advertised. Some of the best money I ever spent.
2,Great for spot massage,The Body Back Buddy is great. This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose. This is perfect for use in between massages. It is much better than using the door jamb. I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
2,Awesome deep tissue pressure!,"I get so tight in my neck and back, and it's hard to massage that away by myself. This thing looks funny, but man, it packs a punch. The pressure points are small, so be careful if you're not into deep tissue. There are pointed spots and more rounded spots, so if you like it on the lighter side, use one of the rounder spots. I use both. I tied a satin sheath over one of the protruding ""branches"" and that works great for sliding the thing around (over a shirt/blouse), without ""sticking"" when it comes to the plastic/skin contact. I can get rid of the tension in my neck and back very well with this thing. It sometimes hurts the day afterward, and I don't care. I just use it again, and the muscles are loose again.If you like it gentle, be careful with this. If you're like me, and aren't that delicate, then get this thing. It's well worth the $20."
2,Covers it all,Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
2,Body back buddy,This product delivers what it claims. I find it very useful and extremely effective at leveraging hard to reach places on my body and massaging deeply areas regardless of location. I would recommend this product to anyone who has muscle pain/ tightness and can't afford / doesn't want to visit a private masseuse. Considering what you get this is a great value!
2,Helpful product,"I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back, as well as my upper traps and neck. It's very helpful in reaching otherwise difficult spots. My problems are quite chronic so this hasn't fully alleviated my trigger points but with more use I'm sure it will. I've found this works well with the ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" which you can buy here on Amazon."
2,Small but nice,"It's pretty well done, nothing to say about that. It's really tiny though, and won't hold anything bigger than small letters."
1,not the same in the picture,"when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice, big enough to hold letter without them hanging over and it also looked like it could hold them sideways.But when she got it and opened it up. It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed. Of course she hung it up. i dont understand if your going to advertise a product and someone buys it atleast send the one that is advertised.Other than the size it is nice work. I love the light color of the wood."
1,Too Small!,This product is way to small to hold any mail.... if you are looking for something to hold your mail in do some research first this only holds up to an index card size envelope!
1,NOT RECOMMAND...,"TOTALLY DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION, TERRIBLE ASSEMBLING... VERY SMALL...NOT RECOMMAND... IF YOU WANT TO BUY ENVELOPE CASE OR SOMETHING... TRY OTHER PRODUCT...."
2,Gift for teacher,I gave this to my favorite math teacher and she loves it. The projects make math concepts easier to understand.
2,Highly underrated,"Great little movie. I'm surprised it didn't get better reviews. Kids and adults liked it. Check it out, good addition to your movie library."
2,Another Bette Davis Classic that does well,"This is a pretty good performance by Bette Davis, Karl Malden in a movie that features a ""poor twin"" and a ""rich twin"". The ""poor twin"" kills the ""rich twin"" and takes over her life.Pretty similar to another movie called ""Stolen Life"" that explores the same theme, except she takes over the twins life after an accident, not after killing her.Although not one of her best, it is still a good watch and a good performance by both actors."
2,Very Good,I enjoyed this old movie. It is one of Bette in her later years but she still had it.The storyline was a twist too..
2,BRAIN DONORS?! MORE LIKE LAUGH LOANERS!,"This movie is just too good for words. It gives you as many laughs as the red green show. The slapstick shenanighans keep comming as the laughs keep rolling. I once laughed so hard i fell asleep and woke up and turned the movie off. One liners, Obesity, Gags, Puns, ensue. Go and rent this now along with once bitten."
2,"An amazing book, one of the best I ever read","A sparkling defense of the one thing most people seem to think indefensible, Christian orthodox thought (You know, old school). This book is a positive, intelligent, funny defense of the faith. One of the best I've ever read."
1,Horrible Formatting,"This book has THE WORST formatting I've ever seen. It looks like it was hastily put together using Microsoft Word. Very amateurish. The cover doesn't even have the title on the spine, so I can't recognize it on my bookshelf.The version from BiblioBazaar:Orthodoxyis MUCH MUCH better, well worth the extra dollar or two."
2,A REALLY GOOD GAS GUN.,"GUN IS VERY GOOD. LOOKS REAL, EXCEPT FOR THE ORANGE TIP. HEAVY, BUT NOT TOO HEAVY. SHOOTS WELL. CAN USE TRIGGER, SLIDE OR JUST POINT AND SHOOT. MAGAZINE HAS A BUTTON TO REMOVE BB'S LIKE A REAL GUN. I HAVE ONE PROBLEM THOUGH, ADDING GAS IS A PROBLEM. IT ALWAYS LEAKS, EVERY TIME. I HAVE A GAS REVOLVER, THAT NEVER LEAKS. I END UP GETTING BURNED, IF I'M NOT CAREFUL. I'M SURE IT HAPPENS WITH OTHER GAS GUNS. REVOLVERS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THIS GAS LEAK PROBLEM. I GIVE IT A 4, CAUSE OF THE GAS LEAKAGE. THANK YOU"
2,If you love Cajun or if you love rock 'n' roll,"you'll love this great CD. The Bluerunners, yeah! Get 'em all!"
1,not very useful,It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass. I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing.
1,Marginally Acceptable,"I would probably have returned this ""loupe"" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe, a 4x Schneider that cost me $80 on eBay. I thought that, for $6, a 10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras. It didn't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus, more or less. One's eye has to be back about 5-6 in. from the ""loupe"". This all means that you only see a very tiny area, which makes using it a real pain. Comparing what I see with this thing at 10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x, I wonder if it's really 10x.I''m not a happy customer. This is the first crummy thing I've gotten from Adorama, having been a steady customer of theirs for several years. I'm disappointed and saddened."
2,"Nice loupe, good price.","I bought this to replace an 8X Agfaloupe I used to have for slides and negatives. Both are good. At this power some of the negatives edges are cut off, but it's easier to see facial expressions. If you need near full frame go with 8X, more detail 10X or even 15X."
2,Good Clear Quality Loupe for price,"Good Clear Quality Loupe for price. Construction could be better, but its a great value for the price."
2,Healing from diarrhea and Ulcerative Colitis,I have struggled with diarrhea from Ulcerative Colitis for the past year or so. I have tried many alternative therapies and as a last ditch effort to stay off of prednisone tried what this book recommends.I have been completely amazed at the results. I went from diarrhea all the time to better than I have been in many many many many years (I'm 43 now). I highly recommend this book and I thank God that He led me to it and made me desperate to try what this book recommends as it has been a major lifestyle change in what I eat.
2,Restoring Your Degestive Health,Love this book and Love Dr. Brasco -- just recently acquired him as a physician was so awesome to have a physician PERSONALLY call you when you're having issues instead of office help -- doesn't happen much anymore -- I learned alot from talking to him personally and from this book.
2,A Whimper not a Bang,"I give this book 4 stars for taking on the topic but agree with other reviewers who find it disappointing ... perhaps because one gets one's hopes up to read a title like this, ""the story of the King James Bible"". McGrath has done some thorough research (it is his profession) and introduces some interesting data from the past but he is unable to weave his story together in a way that conveys with power, passion and enthusiasm what was one of the most stunning events in Anglo/American history. I think this book suffers in great part from lack of good editorship. I give it 4 stars for subject matter and being a unique attempt to explore and present in laymen's terms information about this spectacular creation, second only to Shakespeare for those of us who love the English language! -- but I give it a 2-1/2 for the rest."
2,In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How,"Very well written, extremely informative and interesting. I learned alot more of how the Bible came about and how different Bibles developed. Interesting not only to the Christian community but also to history people. Fascinating read."
2,"Thorough, complete, and quite witty as well","Alister McGrath has a gift for clarity of expression and unbiased treatment of the theological thought and history of any era of which he writes. In the Beginning, unlike his more scholarly works, makes the periods surrounding that of the King James Bible very accessible, even to those who have little knowledge of the time. His highly readable, often hilarious, style provides a very easily understood, very comprehensive treatment of both the theology and politics of the High Middle Ages and Reformation times."
2,worth the read,"I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story, the background information provided was interesting as well."
1,Gets there,"It was an interesting read. At first it was tough to follow, but about halfway through you really get interested and the reader cannot put the novel down!!"
2,GIRLS ARE MADE FOR LOVING,THE MOVIE IS A GREAT CULT CLASSIC FROM THE 70'S. A LITTLE SLOW AT TIMES BUT FUN.
1,Can a book be any duller?,"Abby, the successful engineer returns back to her hometown after 10 years where she meets Chase the former high school hottie. He has a big secret which we find out is the fact that he is illiterate... Their differences in education don't seem to matter, they still get together and plan to spend their future as a married couple, endless rambling on about it later I wish I had not wasted my time on this book."
2,Beautifully colored,"I use the Universal deck in my professional work, but I love the coloring of this deck for personal use. It's strong and evocative, but in a quality way, not loud or garish."

1,old-school text,"Oi, how much more convoluted can a text get? With every edition, this text gets less organized. Or that is at least true for the last 3 editions, anyways ... Eg. In how many chapters can the topic of ""symmetry"" be covered? Keeping it to 1 would be much easier to digest, thankyou.The text is written in old-school rambly style... sure, it covers all topics, but it is hard to learn from (and in my experience, even harder to teach from). There are better options out there. Nesse ""Intro to Mineralogy"" text."
1,returned my copy,"I am surprised O'REILLY published such a weak book. To keep it short, it is one of those ""click here, click there, you are done!"" kind of books. I doesn't go much deeper than the Cocoa tutorials on Apple's developer site."
1,Good School Bag Not A Great Travel Bag.,"I bought this bag for traveling. It is not very comfortable, the shoulder straps feel like they are filled with packing paper, and compared to similar priced bags the material is cheap. It looks great and has plenty of storage. I was replacing a 5 year old Targus Port Bag. Due to the edition of roller gear on the new port bags I decided to go with another bag. For my needs, I should have gone with a different company. Also to note is that the storage is great however, a fully packed bag will not fit in the over head bin of a smaller jet airliner."
1,Not worth the time....,"I really was excited to start reading this book, thinking it would be full of smart, well-crafted essays that would truly make you think (you know, like Bill Hick's stand-up did). So, I was deeply disappointed to find this book just to be fill with uneducated rants that spent more time worrying about fitting a new Bush joke in, then about actually making a point. Great idea, horrible execution."
1,A bunch of whiny losers,"Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy."
1,Bad re-imaging,There are several parts of the film when it just goes to a still photo and voice or backround music is heard. If I knew so much of the original film was missing I probably would not have bought it. I was disappointed in my purchase.DPrice
2,Best movie musical ever,"An epic musical, flawlessly produced by Garland and Luft. A classic tale of stars treading on the (often perillous) arc of fame and popularity, has been beautifully told in song and story. Garland, Mason, Bickford and Noonan: superb actors -all. And that Judy Garland sang those great songs...They don't come better than this great movie musical, the most brilliant of all: a seamless marriage of song and story, with it's one true competitor being Garland's Wizard of Oz."
1,Wonderful Production but 1937 Version Was BEST,"Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in 1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD."
1,not enough,It looks like a microsfot brochure for the people who have no odea about Axapta. it is giving some basic knowledge for beginniners.
1,I did not understand the codes.,Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me.
1,I just can't get into it,"I've had to force myself to read halfway through this book. The pilgrim chapters are the most interesting, but overall, it's just boring."
1,awful squeaking,"yes this is cheap but that's for a reason. the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it. and worst of all, it is increadibly squeaky, and is getting worse."
2,just listen it,"Scene from the second story: The god machine. All I know about this band, they from Montreal(Quebec) and they have a another album before scene from the second story. If you like post-rock music, you gonna really like this band, you just have to close your eyes and.....the energy of they music is unimaginable. I can't choose a song in particulary because they all make the album. If you like Mogwai, Slint, ...try to get a copy because unfortunately is discontinued...but I really don't know why!!!!!!"
2,"Good Ctrl, Promising Software (doesn't work always)","Nice controller, comfortable, Plug n play. No problems, if the game detects the buttons, but had problem with quake 3, with the controller activated, the whole screen started going round and round (spinning). MDK 2 worked great though with analog controls. The analog controls work fine in Unreal tournament as well.The software is promising but could not get much out of it. The best use is to use it as plug and play and enjoy the games it supports."
2,Very confotable and configurable gamepad.,"It's confortable, specially if you have big hands. I use it to play Fifa 2003 and X-Wing alliance. The software that maps the keys of the gamepad to those required by the game allows you to use it for any game.Actually I prefer it over a joystick for flight simulator games. It's a lot more confortable."
1,these are double dobby stripes,nowhere in the description does it say that these sheets are dobby striped. i was looking for solid white sheets. another disappointment!
2,Good general source,"Although exploring nothing new about the Eastern Front and even making some mistakes in the introduction (for example about the Red Army Purges) this book is a very good source to have for the general account and movement of the German Army throughout 1941 on the Eastern Front as well as the respective response from the Soviet side. Although more sources could and should have been used, I can understand why they were not, as the book would be too cumbersome and hard to follow. Detailed studies can be found in various other books of individual unit actions, but that is not what this book is for. If one has an interest in a certain action and/or day that an event occurred on, they can do their own research with this book being their beginning general account/source."
2,A source for some information,"This work contains some interesting information, and can be used as a source in researching particular topics. But it , in my opinion, was never really comprehensive enough. And having had its most recent edition close to fifty years ago is not up-to- date."
1,Don't believe the Hype,"I bought this movie after watching the previews on another movie. I am an action junkie; and this movie looked like tons of action. It was not. They must have shown all of the action scenes in the preview. This movie is VERY LONG, VERY SLOW, BORING, with a very disappointing ending. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
2,Glimpse into a hidden world,"This collection of stories is more than simply a memoir of a childhood lived within a secluded harem. It is also a story of a process of change that took place decades ago as the country of Morocco was becoming an independent nation state.I was fascinated by the stories of the women who spent their lives hidden from the outside world within the family enclaves of the middle class in Morocco. I've purchased it for friends and colleagues who were interested in women's stories, both from a feminist perspective and from a humane one.The stories are told with sensitivity and compassion, as well as a deep respect for, and understanding of Islam."
2,Important read,Well written. Insightful. Entertaining. Informative. Important issues for our times. Interesting to compare Mernissi's childhood experiences with all that she has accomplished since.
2,Amazing,"The content, research, and intellect that went into this very detailed book is nothing short of amazing. Very deep and extemely well written, you will find you cannot stop in the middle. If you want something to stimulate your thinking, challenge your ideas, and push you, READ THIS. It should be a textbook. OUTSTANDING...BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY..."
1,Keep Looking!,"This book was too ambitious. It covered too many topics, spanning from childhood to adulthood, without really getting to any helpful information. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Safekeeping,"I read this because I so enjoyed ""A Three Dog Life,"" about a later period in the author's life after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury. ""Safekeeping"" is not as engaging, but worth a look for those who enjoy memoirs and are interested in crafting their own."
2,_,"This outstanding essay is included in Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins. Great as it is, I would recommend spending a few dollars more to get American Power and the New Mandarins which contain this same text as well as chapters on ""the responsibility of intellectuals,"" ""the revolutionary pacifism of A.J. Muste,"" ""on resistance,"" and much else."
1,Bridesheads Revisited,"Interesting read, not really sure what I expected. Tended to be a bit ponderous. Still, it was a nice change from the usual modern story I often pick up"
1,The SLOWEST read I've had in a long time! Boring!,I usually read a book in one or two nights after dinner. I've been on this book for over a week and have absolutely no problem putting it down. It is just a SLOW read; certainly doesn't have anything in it to hold my interest.I'm a person that refuses to give up (except for a few that I filed in a Mistakes folder) on my kindle. I think I'm up to 62% read now and will probably force myself to finish it but it will definitely get put into the mistakes folder.In other words --- it's just plain BORING!
1,Not JavaScript Objects,"Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called ""Ideas for what to do with JavaScript""."
1,Waste of my Money,"I have worked with javascript for some time and wanted to learn to create javascript objects and impliment them into my code. I thought that this would be the perfect book for my needs but I have never been so wrong. The book could be called ""creating data structures using javascript"" because it jumps right into complex examples of creating data structures with very little explanation of what is happing from a language prospective. I did get far enouph to write some BAD object code and post it out to a news group who got me on the right track. THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU IF YOU ARE TRYING TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. It is now in my trash basket."
1,Faulty Information?,"Apparently the author has lived abroad too long. On page one he states: ""A child born in the U.S., for example, is a U.S. citizen even if both of his parents are illegal immigrants."" Not only is this untrue, a baby born to LEGAL immigrants isn't automatically granted citizenship. The rules changed long before the publishing of this book--the author should verify his facts. I can't help but wonder if the whole book isn't fully of erroneous information (I only read the first ten pages, which are available at the publishers site)."
1,"my child called this ""the worst game ever""","I will say the 3-d fx do work...for a hand-full of pictures, you have to lay out all the cards ( you will need a massive table or the kitchen floor) and search for random objects great concept poorly executed. as the title of the review stated. The 10 year old said ""this is the worst game ever"" we played it once and it's collecting dust on the shelf."
1,bearing problems,Both the original and a replacement Keller dovetali bit quickly lost the lower seal on the bearing which will allow sawdust to build up in the bearing and will lead to premature failure.
2,Great and professional product,This is one of the best RC Ni-Starter out there. I did a lot of research before buying this product. It's with no double one of the most durable and professional.
2,Best bedding set out there!,"The Safari set is the cutest set around and affordable!My mom purchased almost every item in the collection online.The ONLY downfall was that we couldn't find any items in a store near us and there are items we would like to get, like the lamp, and Target doesn't carry it anymore.With a 10% discount, we payed under a dollar in shipping.We were even more satisfied when we viewed the items in person.I HIGHLY recommend this set for a baby girl or boy."
1,Rethink before you buy,"It is in no way the bedding that I don't like. I absolutely love the bedding, however as far as Target making it accessable. that is an entirely different issue. If you plan on getting this as a set you better start checking E-Bay now, because that was the only way I could complete the set. Unfortunately I didn't buy EVERYTHING at once and by the time I went back to purchase the bumper and dust ruffle the manufacturer had discontinued the item.(It wasn't a significant amount of time either). In addition Target was VERY unwilling to help. To make a long story short- if it says arriving soon, rather than a ship date chances are you won't recieve that item, because it is no longer made. Again the bedding is adorable, but for the hassle you'll have to go through to decorate save youself the time and go elsewhere."
2,Love the Look and the Quality!,"I've purchased or recieved almost all of the pieces to this set for my baby boy's nursery and I absolutely love them. This set has bright colors and a fun feel to it! With a different wall paint color, it could easily be for a girl as well. The quality is excellent as far as I can tell and is an improvement from the plain pastel colors that everyone else has to offer!"
2,Look on EBAY,I bought the set as well and love it!! I went on ebay and saw a seller that had a lot of the accessories I wanted. I emailed her and asked her if she could get other items I needed. Now I have all pieces to the collection.
2,Very difficult to locate all items,"I absolutely LOVE this set; however, it is terribly difficult to locate all of it! Only one store in my area even has it in stock, and they don't have everything. I bought the dust ruffle and it doesn't fit on our standard crib- it is an inch too short (not length of the ruffle to the floor, but end to end), I was very disappointed. I adore the &quot;wall hanging&quot; animals, but, not only are they unlisted online, but they are quite hard to find. Once Target sees the popularity of a pattern-they should make a better attempt to make it available; might I suggest a way to locate what local stores have it available to save a multitude of phone calls etc..."
2,Perfect for newbies (like me)!,"I'm new to c++ and decided to try to learn it through this book.It works magnificent in teaching me how C++ works, how to code in it and how to convert C code.It is writen in a very conversational way and it always have some code besides the explenation (I for one enjoy reading the code also when I'm reading the explenation of a new feature!).This book is realy good for teaching people the basics!I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I do (I ain't finished with it as I'm writing this review)."
2,Suhrhold deck Brush,My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years. It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint. The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor. It is still useable after 25 years.
2,Locke gave a thorough understanding for society.,"I thought that this book did a good job of explaining the role of the society and of the government. It also sets up a State of Nature to justify the State. It tells the role of the individual, and the rights entitled to the individual upon entering the State. I enjoyed this book, and enjoy Locke's philosophy."
2,Optima Deep Cycle Yellow,Great Battery. I use lots of accessories and with a high output ALT this battery does the job. If you run AMPS etc this is the battery for you. Lots of reserve power for the Optima Yellow Category. I recommend it as your next Battery....
2,"Detailed and informative, BUT.......","Robert Gordon's account of Muddy's life encompasses the entire spectrum of a great bluesman's struggles and successes from birth to his death in 1983. The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the 1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in 1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book."
2,funny BUT bad,It is FUNNY... VERY Funny!!!!! its just too bad he has to be so vulgar... beyond the very often F Bombs he drops..... he is a very funny man!
1,Just so you know...,"Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me), but I do take offense at his ripping off other, better comedians. It's not an easy thing to come up with material...well, good material anyway. Think of it like a song or a novel. If you wrote a terrific song, performed it at some club and then heard a crappier version of it, recorded by another band, on the radio wouldn't it bother you? Why is comedy any different? If you think it is, then by all means buy this hack's junk, but if you respect integrity don't support this jerk."
1,Hoff doesn't really understand human nature.,"I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic, but he preaches the importance of appreciating things as they are and not struggling against them, while ignoring the fact that the nature of humanity is to change things. Humans struggle to become (or at least appear) other than what they are, and this involves changing the self and the things around oneself. Hoff foolishly ignores this and reduces humanity to the level of fish that are trying in vain to whistle."
2,The Irregulars,This movie is so pleasant and funny that any audience will love it. The resultant outcome is not conservative at all but does play to most everyone's joy.
1,Inconsistent performance,"(+)Great price, high speed(-)HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby. The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away. Yes, I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location. The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used. It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I've bought, third satisfactory result from them. I've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points. Although DLINK isn't at the bottom of the heap, it sure hasn't performed at the top. Checkout 2WIRE (hard to get retail) or Netgear's equipment."
1,absolute junk,"I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new, or older, drivers, the installation is never complete. their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem (though they have tried).i will not spend money on another dlink product."
2,a very good wireless card,"This card has given me the ability to be crazy and sit outside with my laptop and do my work from there. For some reason I feel much more creative when I am outside in the open air rather than inside in the boring stale air.This card was installed in almost no time at all and it felt like it was almost too easy. But after the reboot I was able to find and see that the card was installed correctly and the quick time wasn't a bad thing, but a good thing.The wireless range seems pretty good. I use a DI-524 as my wireless router, but I also don't have a very big home. Either way I am satisfied and would think others would as well."
2,"Fast and stable, if you don't protect access","It works fine with D-Link DI624 wireless router, if you don't set any kind of protection tool. I have got stable and strong connections at 108 Mbps in any point of my house, even with many walls between DWL-G650 and DI-624.At this moment, I am connected for almost 6 hours, without crash and always at 108 Mbps. It works fine with my Sony Vaio notebook and with Toshiba's. But its stability vanishes when I configure any tool for secure networking (WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK ...). So, it works fine, but is not secure."
2,A real winner,I am glad this was my first choice for a wireless adapter. I was told to go out and buy a wireless adapter and with help from the local store's employee he recommended me this card. He said D-Link was a good reputable company. I believed him and bought this card and brought it home. Besides if he wasn't right I could always return it right back to him. :)Either way I was able to get this working by following the intstructions and was connected to my work's wireless network in minutes. I thank the helpful employee who helped me and I thank D-Link. Thank you both.
2,works really well,"I think most of my frustration is due to my ISP, but this thing has been great really. The best feature doesn't even come in the box, but the tech support is phenomenal. I spent a bit of time on hold, but the guy I spoke with had me up and running in no time at all.In general, the setup is easy (I'm using it with the D-Link DI-624). The program installs everything for you, I ran into trouble after my ISP shut down my service for some foolish reason and made me change some settings which I guess messed with my network setup. In any case, this comes highly recommended for anyone that wants to set up a wireless network, even if you aren't particularly computer savvy, as I am not."
1,Does not install properly on HP notebook running XP,Did not install properly. DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful. Drivers have not passed Microsoft's scrunity. I cannot recommend this at all.
1,Poor quality,"Very poor recording. Sounds like it is muffled or filtered. Fortunetly most of these tracks are recorded correctly on the 2 CD set ""The Magic Touch"". Skip this and go to ""The Magic Touch"""
2,Works Great.,I do a little bit of gaming and have compared wireless to running a hard wire and don't find any difference in speed or signal strength. It works well throughout my house (two story 2500 square ft).
1,Piece of Junk,"I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review, its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router. Each update creates new problems. Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs!"
1,Don't Waste your time or money,"This unit is terrible, its poorly made, cheap does not work well with Macintosh computers and the tech-support is terrible! The tech support - barely speaks english, is difficult to understand and the phone connections are awful - made me wonder why they even offer tech support. Trust me this is not a good product."
1,shipping,The router is good- ... 3btech is less than dismal on shippingI ordered with a 3day select ups ship and received over the 3 dayperiod - they had some lame story about not shipping until the 1st full business day - .. which was two days AFTER I placed the order - they refused to do anything refund wise -I will never do business with them again-
1,piece of crap,"d-link needs to get its act together. this router of airplus is a laugh. never seen so much problems from one equipment. lost connection, rebooting itself every half hour, losing signal, rebooting computer to get back signal. returned twice over a span of 3 weeks. fianlly returned back for good for another brand. a linksys speedbooster. now that works great!!tech support wasn't helpful either..spent more time on phone with tech than anybody else. still didn't get the problem solved. each one kept telling me to return the router back and get another one after there book runs out of troublehsooting ideas. tired of that...:( the tech needs help with updatng there knowledge of the equipment and manners. d-link needs to rebuild there router again.its not worth it......buy a linkys speedbooster or netgear instead."
2,3btech & Amazon,I ordered a DI-624 from Amazon by way of 3BTECH. They sent the wrong Router which was an upgrade a DI-624M. But I used the DI-624 on my system and there is a difference in the speed. 3BTECH told me they where the same but if you read the manual they are not. They would not take it back without me paying a shipping charge and restocking fee. Don't deal with 3BTECH because Amazon will not back them up and you don't get the same service like when you deal with Amazon. Stay away from this 3rd party company. You can only contact them by way of e-mail.
1,dlink sucks,i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful. they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap. i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps.
2,Great workhorse,"I've been using this router for years and it has never given me problems. The setup is easy and the maintenance is non-existent. The signal is strong enough to get to my Xbox 360, which is downstairs and across the house.What's so amazing is that while my computer and its components get replaced every few years, this little workhorse has stayed with me through it all.Highly recommended."
1,Waste of money - no range,"From the word go, this router has been painful. I have a 1-room radius from this piece of junk. Sometimes, I one bar on my iphone with it sitting ontop of the router!Easy set up and everything, just doesn't work when set up!"
1,Connection Problems - cannot use all features,"I have had this router for over a year. It worked well for the most part. But every once in a while I got problems with connection, for which I had to call customer support.Now suddenly it has become a big pain ... Both wired and wireless connections drop every 10 mins because router reboots itself. I have made over a dozen calls to tech support, but the problem has remained.The other thing is that D link tech support always tells you to go with basic 802.11b config with no encryption ( the most they would let me do was WEP, and always turned down WPA ). So even though this router has a lot of cool features ( super G, WPA, gaming mode etc. etc. ) , you are not allowed to use any of them. That is because if you try and it does not work, tech support will always tell you to turn all of them off. Thus all I have is a powerful router being used as basic 802.11b."
1,Didn't work for me...,"I futzed with this for about a week. Had d-link tech support's number programmed into my phone (power down the router, press the reset key, replug everything, yada yada yada). I bought this router and the PCI wireless card for my desktop because of the excellent reviews I read on this item at CNET and PC Magazine. The PCI card froze my desktop EVERY time I turned the network on and the router would not connect to my laptop even when the units were a few feet apart. Exchanged for Linksys and have had not one call to tech support. I suppose this will work for a lot of people, but for me this operated as a 1 star product. Do buy from a place you can easily return (like Amazon!) because if your experience is like mine, you will get fed up talking with the tech support people and try something else!"
2,Over my head?,"Frustrating at first because it took me a little while to learn how to use the D-Link Router. Once I learned what all of the terms meant, it was smooth sailing. Now I have a safe wireless computer, am able to work outside or at a neighbor's house! One more thing I must say, this is working on an OS X v.10.3.9. This wireless system almost felt like it was made for my little Mac. I did a lot of research to find the best wireless router for this computer and this is the only one I could find that claimed to ""welcome Mac."" computers."
1,Ripoff,"I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago; my family got cable and a wired network just wasn't feasible with our layout, so we went with this D-Link device.Connection drops every few minutes, and sometimes it won't come back up until the router is rebooted...which requires unplugging the router and the modem, then putting them through their boot cycles one at a time. When it works its best we do this every other day, at its worst we do it daily; today it had to be rebooted three times in one hour.I've tried multiple connection devices, DWL 122, DWL G650, DWL G520, and whatever one came built into my sister's Dell. Getting closer to the router hasn't helped; it still even dropped packets. (As an example, an instant message or two may simply never reach me.)Needless to say, my family's looking for something new since their tech support's suggestions were useless."
1,Buy another router-unstable connections,"DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers, wired and wireless, attached to it. What's more, it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection, which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to 10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold. But the issue is not resolve. Upgrading to new firmware (2.50)won't resolve the issue either. Furthermore, replacing the network card for a new one won't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing, calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face....go for it..."
2,Caveat usage,"Like the previous reviewer, I am finding lots of incompabilities between vendors. My D-L 624 works just peachy with the built-in in my wife's Dell, and likes my Proxim Orinoco. It hates my son's Linksys when any form of encryption is enabled, but with WEP off handles it fairly well. For work I coupled the D-Link 624 with the 650 card and it works just fine. I had my son buy a Linksys card because the router that he's sharing at school is a Linksys, but which refused to recognize the Proxim card that works with my D-Link. I think all of this indicates just how imature this technology is. It probably ain't you if it doesn't work.Also, DLink does a pretty good job of updating their firmware, and you probably want to take the time to update the BIOS (easy, just follow the fairly clear instructions) before you start loading MACs and enabling things (you can't import your old settings after you flash the bios - you start over from the beginning)."
2,Delivers as promised,Not only does this product deliver all that is advertised but the service from D-Link is without a doubt the best in the high tech industry. Every vendor should take notice.
1,can't handle browser idle time (poor support),"Installation was easy and everything looked great. Until I tried to access the internet via my browser the next morning (""page cannot be displayed""). All ideas of the helpdesk how to fix it didn't change anything (we exchanged about 20 emails) so that they agreed it was a hardware problem. I returned it and got the next one with the same problem. The answer of the helpdesk this time: don't use ZoneAlarm. And if this is not the problem, then it must be Windows XP. Unfortunately, shutting down ZoneAlarm didn't fix the problem. So the problem must be Windows XP in their opinion. That's an easy excuse because nobody can prove anything and I got stuck with my router and my problem. So I returned it.Conclusion: if you have a dial-up connection and don't stay connected while being idle, this is a good product. If you have a cable modem and don't shut down your computer all the time, try a different router."
1,Awesomely horrible product,"Wow. What can I say other than this has got to be one of the worst electronic purchases that I've ever made. The DWL-G650 is a pretty good PCCard, however the DI-624 router is absolutely horrid! From the moment I plugged it in it wouldn't quit rebooting itself every 1-2 minutes kicking me off the network. Firmware flashes didn't solve the problem at all nor did a replacement product. (Incidentally, Amazon.com was WONDERFUL about sending a replacement product). How D-Link gets away with selling this product is beyond me. I'd read similar reviews on the product with it constantly rebooting however I must admit that I'd written those off as the typical ""home user"" that really didn't know what they were doing. Well, as a network engineer and systems administrator at one of the world's largest computer companies, I have to throw my towel in to the absolutely worst network product I've ever worked with here in the DI-624. Please... avoid this router at ALL costs."
2,"Not as good as season one, but...","Season one South Park was hilarious, an absolute riot - But unfortunately it lost its way a little in season two. However, season two is still really funny and these DVDs are well worth buying. If you have a high (and I do mean high!) tolerance level of all things foul, then you HAVE TO buy South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut - UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY, YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING MORE FUNNIER!"
1,Not so funny,"Just got through watching this. The jokes are cruder, less funny, and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again. I enjoyed the first 3 volumes but these don't cut it. Also, you can't fast forward thru the credits or FBI warnings (that appear with each cartoon. I was disappointed in this release."
1,Awful!,"This is one exploitation that has no story; or the story is so hard to follow that it is incomprehensible. Rita Calderone is gorgeous, but other than that - this movie is thumbs down."
1,In a word: Terrible.,"How anyone could rate this debacle above one star is beyond me. First of all, this is not the Grateful Dead that you hear playing all your favorite songs. This is a sad and withered remnant of the once great band. I love the Grateful Dead so I decided to buy this box set hoping that, although the shows are from the early 90s, that the band could still rock. Unfortunatly, I was wrong. Their playing is awful. Its sparse and sprinkled with lame synth garbage with whatever keys player they dredged up this time, it really doesn't matter who. They play such classics (hint: sarcasm) as Wang Dang Doodle, Touch of Grey (which was, incredibly, their only chart topper even though its an awful song), My Brother Esau, and sundry other lame songs. Do yourself a favor, if you love this band, don't buy this box set, its like watching a dying lion. You know how powerful it was in its heydey, but all you can see now is a sick, mottled mess. Stick with their audio stuff."
2,Recommended,"The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery. I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality."
2,Awesome!,Omg These are so dang cute! I can't wait to try them out! I used the top part as a 'cookie' mold but I'm gonna use the entire thing next time. :)
2,Could be compared with Living Colour,"These guys remind me of a softer Living Colour (Vernon Reid, etc.) Not bad for mid nineties. The music hasn't aged much at all. Highly recommended."
1,"terrible, even at a low price","I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home. Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair. The charge doesn't last through one haircut.The trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut, and they don't trim evenly. I finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I was extremely disappointed in it."
1,Piece of junk - do not bother.,"I've been very disappointed with this since we got it. Even with the unit fully charged & operating with the cord plugged in, it struggles to keep up with normal hair cutting. It takes multiple passes to cut, what would have taken our last trimmer, a Norelco plug in model that lasted 8 years, one pass.Build quality: poor. Everything in the kit feels cheap.Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy. Do not buy this trimmer."
2,Excellent for the money,"I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer. The Wahl model 9627 is compact and flexible. The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to 1 and 3/4 inches long. The unit can be used with or without a cord and the smaller size makes it easier to maneuver than larger ones. It does an excellent job of cutting hair. It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff. It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty. The money I am saving on haircuts makes that a bargain."
2,"If you want to improve your health, read this book","I highly recommend all of Norman Walker's books. Although written many years ago, I think they are even more relevant in today's world. It is an easy to read book with information that will have you wanting more even information about the subject. Also, please read all his other books."
2,Great!,I thought this movie was awesome. I've always thought Dana Carvey was a hilarious actor and this movie was just as funny as he. I recommend it!
1,A waste of talent,"This movie was probably the biggest bomb of 1994. It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones, Dana Carvey, and Kevin Pollak. However, this was very unfunny. Mind you my heart really wasn't into this movie anyway as I had a rejection the night before I saw this, so I couldn't focus into the movie, but there really wasn't anything to focus into here. It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not ""THE"" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than ""Ishtar"" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either. Like I said this was the biggest bomb of 1994."
2,The beauty is in the truth,"People,wake up!The truth may hurt sometimes,but,it gives a picture.Lee has given me what I needed,an insiders view,albeit a bit of a kick to Beckett at times,but,I was never there,was I?I see music,or hear music,and,Tim Buckley is me seeing,hearing,and knowing my home.Lee has given me an answer to why my home is thus,and thank the lord I am not alone.I read Blue melody 3 hours straight,and finished it off this morning,I ate it,rather than read it,and,Lorca and Starsailor demand my attention,these seem to me to be the main message in the book,don't talk,just listen..As much as David Browne may seem sincere in his writing of ""Dream brother"",there is no substitute for knowing the man,Tim Buckley,than for reading Blue Melody,by a friend who was there.Starsailor,you will never dim.Lee,shine on."
2,My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them,"My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far, he is doing ok with whitefish and salmon. That is why this treat is so good. It does smell strongly of fish, it smells good. Its got a crunchy texture, its unlike any other pup treat I've found. My pup loves it, when I take the bag out of the pantry he runs to the kitchen and sits for his treat. Don't even have to call him.The 28oz resealable bag is great, the treats last a long time. If your pup has allergies, you may want to think about giving this one a chance. Guaranteed, your pup will love them."
2,A realistic view of what it is like to have dementia,This was a book that was kind of hard to read at times because it was written by an individual who actually had Alzheimer's. However if you really want to see how the individual themselves are affected by the disease this is a good book to try to read.
1,Only for those in absolute need of resolution,"I never thought I would say this about a book in this series, but I hate this book. I was absolutely disappointed with the way Card chose to resolve his story. I'll give him license since he may do what he will with his story, but I feel so bitter about this ending to such a magnificent saga that I can't recommend this to anybody that isn't dying of curiousity at the end of ""Xenocide"".And to those who believe you fit in this category, I'm sorry for the feelings you will like possess upon completion. I honestly feel the same unrest now as I did when I finished ""Xenocide"". I hope everyday that Card will come to his senses and revise his plot here to be more logical, less rushed, more conclusive (which some may argue with), and more fulfilling to a character of such quality as Ender Wiggin."
1,Should never have been written,"I highly recommend NOT reading this book, which managed to diminish the magic of Ender's Game for me. Stop at Xenocide, which was pretty good, and skip straight to Ender's Shadow, which is VERY good. This book is exceedingly disjointed, makes way too much of the Valentine/Peter dichotomy, and is boring, boring, boring. Where I couldn't put the other Ender books down, I had to really struggle to finish this one. And then wished I hadn't."
1,Weak ending to a great series,"I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed, this story isn't really about Ender at all but about the 2 Ender ""clones"", Peter and Valentine. While this does not make this a bad novel, frankly, I was hoping that Card would have found a way to make the demise of Andrew Wiggen, one of the more interesting protagonists in science fiction, more memorable. Wiggen's death is reduced to almost a footnote in this installment and I could never generate the same degree of interest in either Peter or the young Valentine"
1,A poor ending to a great story,"I can't tell you how dissapointed I was in this book. It was not what I have come to expect from Orson Scott Card. Many authors take a concept to the point where they just fill pages with words (i.e. Piers Anthony & his Xanth tales), but I expected more from this author. I know Card is capable of better work Treason, and the entire Alvin Maker series are a testament to that, but this last book in the Ender Wiggins saga is not in the same class as his other works. My best advice is to ignore this book and enjoy the Ender Wiggins Trilogy"
1,How could this happen?,"I dunno--I liked the other three books in the series. For some reason, though, this one just seemed tedious. Character interaction is there, sure, but it seems dull and plodding. Everything about it just seems to lack the spark that usually makes Card so great. I suppose if you've read the rest of the series you'll probably want to read this one too, but don't expect too much. Card's biggest (only?) letdown."
1,Card should have quit while he was ahead !,He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of ..
2,GREAT ENDING TO THE BEST SCI-FI SAGA EVER WRITTEN,"""Jane closed her eyes, smiled, and then all four of them were gone. Only the mothertree remained in the center of the clearing, bathed in light, heavy with fruit, festooned with blossoms, a perpetual celebrant to the ancient mystery of life"" I write this last paragraph of ""Children of the Mind"" from memory as I felt it was worth it to memorize the ending to the greatest SCI-FI saga ever written. This book ending the ""Ender's Saga"" is a masterpiece of writing. The characters are rich and full of life both good and bad. The morale battles waged are gripping and thought provoking. I recommend without any reservations that anyone who loves to read a well written story that they buy all the books in the series and pass them on to friends, family and loved ones as you will be giving them a gift of more than just words on a page but a gift of what life is all about."
2,A new triumph of a great mind,"This book, the forth in the Ender series shows whyOrson Scott Card is one of the best writers of ourtime.Every novel in the serie has been as different fromthe ones before it as books in a serie can be.In this novel Card brings to conclusion the storyof Ender Wiggins in a way that is both surprisingand highly imaginative.This is a book that no Card fan, and in fact noscience fiction fan, can afford to miss."
1,Too many miracles....,"Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated, it had the same rambling tone, as if the author didn't quite know where to take it, and wrote the story while searching for a way out. In doing so, the story became too unbelievable, to be enjoyable. There were too many miracles, too many near deaths, too many almost destructions. Every time Card couldn't think of a way to get himself out of a tight situation, a new ""miracle of science"" was discovered, making the story a winding tale. The question is raised: Is it fair to give a lightsaber to a man facing lions?The ending left you hanging, but I, for one, have no desire to learn or read more. I have a feeling this was not meant as the end of a series, but the beginning of a new saga. A saga that may draw in others, but will continue to destroy the perfection of the original, Ender's Game"
1,Things kind of got crazy...,...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
2,Very scary and very good!,Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! The only thing I didn't understand was the ending. Otherwise this was a great book!
1,"I didn't get ""it""","I like Adam Sandler, but I didn't like or ""get"" this movie's point at all. Forewarning: This is not Sandler's typical role. I'm all for him branching out into different styles and I think he's quite capable, except I had a very hard time getting past that because of all the weirdness in this film.The opening sequence is just bizarre and you wonder throughout the entire film what the point of the instrument is. The relationship between Sandler and his love interest is equally bizarre. This has DEFINITELY an indie type of film feel, but does not come close to ONE HOUR PHOTO, which I think also has the same type of feel, yet is far superior. This movie is disturbing at times and confusing at others. I felt like I was doing drugs during this movie (which I can assure you I was not). The ending is a ""Huh?"""
1,Move on,"I saw this movie when it was originally released and have to say that may thoughts of it have not gotten any better in that time. I had high hopes for it going in and kept waiting for that moment when I would feel that my money had not been wasted. The moment never came. This was an awful movie. Boring dialog, uninteresting characters, painfully slow pacing. This is really no different than any of the other movies Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed. This is the worst of the big 3 but they are all highly overrated."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I've seens some bad movies in my day, but this one takes the cake. There is no subtle charm in this movie whatsoever. There are several scenes that have nothing but silence - no background mood music, nothing. Then, many of the other scenes have painful background music that drags on and on. Further, the cinematography is horrible. There are random camera shakes which I thought are part of the plot line when in fact it is just poor production. Not surprisingly, Adam Sandler cannot hold his own in a non-comedic role. His acting skills left a lot to be desired. As I walked out of the movie after about 40 minutes, I noticed that the door in the back of the theater was left open. I soon realized why as more people began walking out after I did. Make your own decision here, but I strongly recommend seeing anything else, or go golfing or something. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't Bother,"How anyone could think this movie was anything but complete garbage was beyond me.I guess a lot of these reviewers are extremely ""deep."""
1,Not Worth Watching -spoilers-,"This movie is a bore! And kind of annoying!It's not a romance/comedy! Drama...er...a little? Not a lot.Alright, the story itself is good. Plot is terrific, characters alright. Acting is great.The constant music through-out the movie was just annoying. The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating. The only character that wasn't a complete Mary-Sue (or one-dimensional) was the main character, Barry.This could have been a great movie if it wasn't for the script, the shooting style, and the annoying background music."
1,Save your time and your money...,"I saw this movie after seeing trailers for it on a couple of occasions. I thought it looked like a light comedy/romance. What a waste of my time and money! The only thing that kept me from leaving the theater was the hope that it HAD to get better eventually. Wrong. I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan, but that wasn't it at all. I actually thought he was pretty good in this, but I thought the movie itself was disgusting and depressing. One review I saw said it was a ""dark comedy""....well I agree that it was definitely dark! Not much of a comedy, though. Thank goodness we all have differing tastes, because some people may see something redeeming in this movie, but I truly thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!! Again, save your time and your money!"
1,"Sad, sad, movie","I love quirky and insightful movies. I watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SPANISH PRISONER, GLEN GARY GLENROSS, and all the rest and enjoy them over and over, relishing in the twists and turns and messages that these movies dispense. But, I'm not going to slap kudos on PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. This move is as disturbing as it is sad. The violence is not enjoyable. It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone."
1,punch drunk love,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Adam sandler is the ony reason i kept watching. No plot, No real story to the characters. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time,"A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work, but do in the most amazing way. The best American film since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr."
2,ANOTHER GREAT NOVELLA BY THE AWESOME DIVAS,"I truly enjoyed this work of fiction by my favorite authors. I hate to tell what is in a book, but when you see these four authors and including Felicia Mason, pick up the book and run to the counter. Each story centralized around age, divorce, widow, lost love and true love. Each story was awesome and you wouldn't be upset at all that you decided to purchase it. Pick up this book and let the adventure begin. Read the other reviews and they will tell you a little more. I love to read and watch a good movie and I get highly upset when I am told about it before I got a chance to read or watch it."
1,Flexrake 100A,"I have had a hula hoe for year. It has worked will and the handle is worn out. After receiving this aluminum handled Hula Hoe it broke after two weeks. It is because of the way the aluminum handle is inserted into the hoe head. They make cuts along the end of the handle and insert it into the taped end of the head. This makes it very weak. I bent after a little use. I contacted Hula Hoe and they are sending me a new handle. However, until they swedge the end ot fhte handle to fit the head instead of cutting it the handle will only break again unless it it reinforced with a wood plug, which is what I plan on doing. Intill the design is changed I would recommend only the wood handled model."
2,Four Stars - For this price you know what to expect!,"I'm not going to get into many technical details. Not because I can't but because at this price range you KNOW what you are getting. With that said this unit has performed very well. Most of us will never run this at the high end of the volume spectrum, so distortion isn't an issue. The average person will be more than satisfied with this unit. One thing I will mention is that the ""Auto Calibration"" (for speaker set-up) using the included mic was not close enough for me. Most people probably wouldn't notice. There is a Robust menu for customizing your sound with many features found in higher end receivers. The remote is a little cheesy, as most are lately. I'm using it in a smaller home theater in my bedroom. Main/only home theater use would be fine, plenty of power and way better than the receivers that are in most ""canned"" systems (all in one's). Good receiver/great price (approx. two hundred dollar range)."
1,My third POS Sony...,"The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers. Complicated setup, heat sensitive. Give it a pass. This is my third and last Sony product I will ever buy. I've got a '70s era Pioneer in the shop that runs forever, I think I'll give them a shot this time."
1,Worst receiver I have ever bought,"Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working. Up until now, I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years, so I am a little peeved. I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products, so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon. And FYI, I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors..."
2,This book is well written,This book is well written. I love the details of the history of Seven Oaks. It does include some pictures which help to illustrate of a time and place long lost.
1,BEWARE! Pan and scan DVD,"These two movies are not Conway's best, but they are still pretty good. The only problem, and the reason for the 1 star rating, is that the DVD presents these films with the sides cut off. In other words, Pan and scan. Had I know that, I would not have bought this."
2,Great Movie,In received my video very fast. I love doing business with Amazon. I never had any problems with them. The movie is great if you like Tim Conway. I love the old movies. They are classic to me. So you should enjoy the movie if you enjoy him.
2,Farm Aid at its best,"You gotta see it to believe it. Call your friends, grab some brew and dance the night away!Song List:1) I Love You (M.

1,Not so good,"Bad, It really couldn't catch my attention. So so acting and not so good effects. The plot has been overdone."
1,"""But what are her chances?!""","This movie is great to watch if you're having a bad movie night with snarky friends. As a serious movie, it's a joke. The acting is atrocious, the effects are beyond cheap, and the plot *rolls eyes*. But like I said, it's good for a laugh especially on a bad movie night."
2,Another Supreme Vampire title!,this one is good very good in fact! imagine vampires came forward and revealed themselves to the world (only about 4500 world wide) sun does not harm them they are allergic to silver (umm werewolves eh sheesh) and beheading is fatal its a modern future that looks decayed such as ww3 took place (in london no less lol) but the explanation of vampires as an evolutionary step rather then supernatural was refreshing for a change yes they can climb walls yes they drink blood and yes they are super strong ( as demonstrated in the video of vampires showing themselves lifting something not so light hehe)4 of 5 stars only one star loss for being a little talkie but theres enough action and vampire action to make this film a must own to any true vampire fan!
1,a million thumbs down,"I only gave this movie one star because there wasn't an option for NEGATIVE 5 stars, but since I did give it one star that star goes to the pseudo 'special effects' (split screen, going backwards, speeding up) which is the only plus about the move. The rest of it tanked, big time. The plot was numb, the characters numb, the acting from some seemingly talented young hot stars was numb. Overall, this movie made my brain go numb. The voice overs were nauseating! Yeah all those things happen to teens in college, but they went a little overboard.It was really bad and I didn't realize it was a Sundance movie, otherwise I would have been a little more prepared.The only treat was looking at the cute gay guy named Paul. Shannon Sossamon was the only stand out 'performance' if there had to be one.DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE...!"
1,When the movie ended the fun began,"Seriously, the best part of this movie is when the credits roll. That's when Erasure's ""STOP!"" kicks in, a raucous song that will have you up and on your toes.I tuned in and out of this movie when it was on HBO, it never really held my attention. Sure there were some cute actors and actresses who were stripping down now and then but the whole movie was just bizarre. I kept watching though because I was bored. Finally this piece of junk ended and my favorite band started singing.Instead of buying this, just go buy any one of Erasure's great albums instead. More bang for your buck."
1,Awful,"Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it."
1,where are the rules?,"Simplicity of it... the first of 45 minutes of it was intriguing, then it just falls apart."
2,Quite Possibly ...,"This has to be the best, or one of the best pieces of cinematography that I have ever seen. The spit shot scene, the numerous shots of time fast-forwarding and rewinding, the multiple character thought patterns, all help to add this to my favorites list. I am very impressed with the well thought out characters, extraordinary dialogue, and character motivation. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend that you do it's an excellent piece of movie magic."
2,Excellent book,"The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although, the story is about events that are happening in a particular Armenian family, in reality it is the life all immigrants in America. The stories some how effects all Americans. I am positive that some where in our lifetime we were criticized for a certain cultural trait. It is the story of the ultimate underdog who is determined to succeed. At the same time it is a very fun and easy book to read. I could not put the book down.Saroyan has to be the best writer to come out of the West. He should have been recognized more for his genius work."
1,Really Sad!,"I remember the first time I heard Nelly, it was back in 1999/2000. I am sad to see great musicians fold under the weight of the music industry. She sold-out big time and will never be the same. The album title is very appropriate as she is nothing more than American sex appeal and MTV. I miss the music..."
1,GWEN'S LEFT OVERS,"I bought this album cuz it was on sale for $7 bucks. It ONLY has 3 good tracks: Maneater, Promisuos,& No Hay Igual. The rest of the album is boring and unexciting. This album sounds like Gwen Stefani's left over from LOVE, ANGLE, MUSIC, BABY."
1,a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani,"sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves,lets get Timberland. Timberland during the mid to late 90's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker,but never really added anything to himself beyond beats&he eventually fell out of Groove. Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound&style that while has a minute or two coolness,loses it's appeal rather sooner than later. vocally she is a lightweight. her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland can't be found.this is only her 3rd release&the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone. the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen's Solo Album,but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole."
1,"A little catchy, pretty disappointing","It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way. I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around. While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so ""give it to me"". It's also missing the ""rap/yodeling/soul"" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album."
1,What a sell out!,"I loved Nelly Furtado's cd Folklore. But what I used to love about Nelly Furtado was that she prided herself in her music... not bumping and grinding with Justin Timberlake. Why does nearly every single famous female feel the need to suddenly become a sex image? She's a gorgeous girl and she doesn't need to sport a baby tee to prove it. For that reason alone, I can't see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music."
2,whatchutalkinbout?,"people are saying nelly sold out and changed but why? She was always a little bit of r&b and hip hop anyways beneath all those folk tunes. She was in a hip hop group before her first album, cited mary j blige as one of her favourite artists(queen of hip hop soul), duetted with missy and did turn out the lights which sounded hip hop. Stop messing around with nelly just cause you don't have the talent she does for songwriting and being able to switch genres and looking damn beautiful all the time! What's also great about this Cd is that she's having mass appeal reaching out to blacks, whites, europeans, asians etc. and people off all ages from mothers to teenagers to college kids. and this isn't something every single artist out there is able to do. My hat goes off to this chick for kicking booty this summer!"
2,Plain and simple,"YOU NEED THIS CD!!I have been waiting a long long time for another N. Furtado album and it was honestly worth the wait. Granted it's completely different from her previous work (which are also great) but its ok for artist to change, evolve, and simply play around with other forms of music. Honestly, I perfer to listen to artist who are willin to take chances and try different things because I know I'll be entertained. This cd is crack from beginning to end.CAUTION: May be addicting."
2,Cold War Fun,I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid and when my Dad recommended getting this I was glad you did because it is so funny. The humour is still fresh despite the cold war being over. A movie like this could never work today but its still good clean fun.
2,movie,"I wanted a copy of this movie because my husband is in it.I haven't watched it to the end yet, so I hope he is in the credits.Came quickly,good condition."
2,Classic movie!,"Been looking for this movie on DVD for years. One of the all time classic comedies. Comedic timing perfect! Not your ""action packed"" comedy, but nonetheless a star-studded classic. Put on par with the original ""Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."""
2,"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming","A very entertaining film made during the cold war. There are numerous humorous scenes that typifies a New Englander, from the town drunk who envisioned himself as reinacting Paul Revere's famous ride to the old Veteran who thought he should organize a militia to protect the city from what was viewed as an impending attack by Russians who only wanted to find a way to get themselves back to sea. I think it is well done. Alan Arkin does a great job portraying a Russian officer who is frustrated with his Captain."
1,"the movie is great, but the two on dvd i received are NOT coded for the USA!!!","this is suppose to be a multi-national, coded dvd, but 2 for 2 were rejected by my new dvd player. i then placed both into my lap-top and a message displayed that 2/5 codes worked while 3 were inactive (USA, being 1/3 inactive codes). so, don't purchase this dvd unless you watch it on your computer online. HOWEEVER, the movie is excellent!!! it is totally clean, comical, with some drama, romance, and warmth of humanity. so i have cept one of the 'not coded for the USA' copies for my laptop, because i cannot get it anyother way apparently. NOT EVEN FROM AMAZON!"
1,Mail Order Ties...,"I can't recommend ordering ties on line--or at least, from this vendor. Tie was not Navy--it was ROYAL blue. Plus, the stitching started falling apart after 2 uses."
1,Mixed feelings,"So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori ""schooling"", but this book didn't give me anything new, in fact most of it was pretty dated. And much of the theory was very common sense, such as how to show your child how to do something, I was like ""um...yeah, no kidding"". Also, I don't know if this is because it is so dated(40's?) but many of the tasks for ""3 to 5"" year olds my 1 1/2 year old can do, or is already learning, I felt like much of the things this book guides you to show your two year old, my bobbler already gets. There is even a part where it suggests we start teaching colors at age 3, my kid knows all his colors even though he can't say them. I am not bragging here, it was just weird. Also the ""busy board"" is put together with upholstery tacks, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid playing with something that included tacks.There was NOTHING here that I couldn't find on Montessori sites, or mom blogs."
2,Excellent addition to your collection,I collect action figures and when I saw these I immediately thought they were the most original action figure I've seen in a long time. They are fun to assemble they have a good number of variants coming out and they are completely interchangeable. In fact the website even encourages you to make your own parts and to paint them. They are capable of providing hours of fun for anyone from 8 to 60+.
1,disapointed 8 year old,"My son bought the green and tan stikfas. First he was disapointed that there was only one figure. He'd imagined a number to set up a battle. At this price that is unlikely. (Maybe this is a creative toy for grown ups in there early 20's with lots of money.) He built it, searched the web site, did an experimental bit of decorating and left it on the dining room table for a week. They are currently living in a zip lock bag."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I was looking forward to getting this book. Well, I just got it in the mail and am extremely disappointed with the information. Many of the towns I am very familiar with because I have either visited or done research on my own. The bottom line with this book is this: the information is not just old it is ""very old""! Save your money, buy a different book, or just do internet searches. I wish I had."
1,Buy the green stuff instead -_-,"It doesn't seem to matter how much I press the edge in to the surface, I just canNOT get a clean paint edge with this tape. It was only super important to have a perfect line on one wall (accent color), and I can't even get that one wall out of this tape. I've done touch up about 4 times, and it's not even a big wall!The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that this is the ""delicate surfaces"" tape, and it DID come off more readily than the regular blue tape. I'm working over fairly old molding in places, and the regular tape left gunk, and took up the finish - this kind did NOT damage the molding at all."
1,Doesn't work as well as original,"I recently put in bamboo flooring on my stairs and needed to paint the sides of the stairs where they were scuffed during installation. I used this ""Delicate tape"", which didn't do anything like a painters tape should. It didn't stay put and was constantly curling up at the corners, the paint seeped through onto the new stairs. Lastly it actually removed a lot of stain (stained black by manufacturer) from the floor boards.Don't bother with the fancy tape names. Stick with the original. I can only assume that Scotch found a way to skimp on the glue and called it ""delicate"".As a side note, I bought two of the other ""New Styles"" of tape, one which was supposed to keep lines crisp and straight. It did neither. It was worse than the Frog Tape, which doesn't live up to its name either.I hope this review is helpful for others. There is nothing I hate more than touch up work when painting, and this tape, and the whole new line from my experience, creates a lot of touch up."
2,Running Blind ( Jack Reachger no 4),I always enjoy the Jack reacher series. They are easy read and always keep you gussing. Jack always comes out on top. Too bad he can't settle down with a good woman.
2,uncanny,"like the way he fiqures out the truth, lots of action. always getting himself in danergous situations. Great character, well written"
2,Gripping,"I am now on my fourth (in a row) Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child who manages to combine hard action, originality and excellent storyline twists which keep you guessing right to the last page. Thoroughly recommended."
2,Good book,It was a very good book! I cant wait for the next book in the series. Reacher at his best.
1,Not the best Reacher,"An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable ""twist"", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money."
1,Horrible,"I hated this. Read the first Reacher book a couple of weeks ago, absolutely loved it and got completely hooked. Just finished Reacher #5 and about to download 6.If you ask me, the first two are stunning (5* masterpieces), #3 is good but not as good (different feel to it but still interesting, 3-4*), but this was horrible. The CIA came across as completely unbelievable, the 'twist' was visible a mile off, and the whole thing was based on a flawed premise (SPOILER: hypnosis just doesn't work like that).Five was better but also flawed (3*?).The first two were so good that I am going to plod on, however. Hope the series gets back on track.[this reminds me of the John Rain books, where the first two are stunning and then the whole thing gets tired fast once he leaves Japan and gets his annoying sidekicks...]"
1,This IS 'Running Blind',"This is the same book as 'Running Blind'. If you own that title,(good book, by the way), don't waste your money on this."
2,Running Blind (Jack Reacher No. 4),"I thought the ending was a bit ""flat"" compared to the first three Jack Reacher books. Also, I thought the degree to which the FBI tried to set Reacher up stretched believability and necessity. However, all in all I have enjoyed the Jack Reacher books and will purchase future titles."
2,"Good who and ""how"" dunnit. Keeps you guessing.","Great dialogue and keeps you guessing until the end. Although it is an earlier Jack Reacher novel, it shows that high tech and CGI are not necessary to make a good exciting story."
2,good read,"Just past the middle of it. Not as much violence as the other books but it has more curves in the plot than JLO... If you dislike the FBI, than you will love how Jack screws around with them."
1,dvd does not play,"I was very excited to get this movie on dvd which did arrive very promptly. Unfortunately, this disk from Movie Mars will not play on my dvd player. When I press play, the message CANNOT PLAY is displayed. I have ordered many dvds from Amazon and have never had this problem."
1,3 Defective Phones from ATT and Counting,"I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, ""DOA"" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though..."
1,How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??,"The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and ""click"" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it."
2,Functional and Fairly Durable,"I received this hamper as a baby shower gift and then turned around and purchased one to give to a friend for her baby shower. It's quite attractive and available in several nice colors. Since it doesn't scream ""baby,"" it maintains its usefulness over the years, and folds up into a nice slender package when not in use. The durability of the inner mesh lining is my only issue. I've had to repair the cloth loops a couple of times when I tried to haul heavy loads - but the repairs were simple (I'm no seamstress, so it was REALLY simple) and the hamper is still functional after three years of use."
2,Java Programming with Oracle SQLJ - above average,"My knowledge of Oracle and Java is beginner/intermediate level and I like this book a lot.The book explains how SQLJ relates to SQL, PL/SQL, Java, JDBC and it provides a good introduction to the JDeveloper IDE (Integrated Development Environment).The book is written very clearly and the appearance and organization of the text is well up to the O'Reilly standard.I can't comment on the worked examples yet as I have not yet tried them out."
1,Awful Fake Compilation BEWARE!,The music is not by the original artist. Like buying bad Karioke. Very misleading.
2,A history of a major Wall Street bank and more.,"When in 1976 Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis, and George Roberts left Bear Stears to form KKR, Wall Street realized these three dealermakers might become a major force in the restructuring of American big business then beginning. What could not be predicted was the heights KKR would achieve. It has risen from the ranks of upstarts to become a major player in ""The New Establishment."" While KKR has been the subject of other books and articles, none could be considered ""definitive,"" as is ""The New Financial Capitalists."" It is more than a history of a bank, however. Baker and Smith have addressed the problem posed by the separation of ownership and management delineated in 1934 by Adolph Berle and Gardner Means in ""The Modern Corporation and Private Property,"" indicating how the leveraged buyout programs of the 1980s helped resolve it."
1,Does not fit!,"Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette. The description ""For GM 87-05"" is too vague."
1,Wouldn't Recomend to Anyone,"Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. Hooked all the necessary wires up, disassembled the dash and popped out the radio, only to find that the harness DID NOT EVEN CLOSELY RESEMBLE the factory harness. If one is looking for sheer disappointment, have at it. Buy it in bulk then. Heck, go ahead and tell your kid Santa isn't real while your at it. Whatever tickles the ole pickle."
2,I never ordered this but get to review it anyway!,"Gotta love the internet, I never purchased this item but love to review things. How is that any different than professional sports I will never know. Semper fi, never been in the military either......"
2,Metra Harness,"I LOVE Metra products!!!!!!!!!!!!They make installing a stereo SUPER easy,allows you to solder all the connections easily in your workshop or kitchen or wherever your good lady permits you to work,then you can makesure you have a sturdy and safe set of connections,remember the vehicle is either the family transport,or the way you get to work,go out in with friends,so why risk a car fire and a pile of plastic crap on the floor where your carpet once was.Spend the extra $$$$ its really worthwhile................if you need to speak with Metra they are very helpful"
1,Well....not quite what I anticipated,"This bag was going to be for me to use at college, and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that. It is more made for elementry to middle school kids. So luckily I have a little sister to give it to, but otherwise, I'm pretty disappointed."
1,why do people like this so much?,It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it. I think it is not good for a child. Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke!!!
2,"Simple, good backpack","This backpack is everything a backpack should be; simple, functional, and well-fitting. I would undoubtedly buy it again, although it seems as though it will be holding up for a long time to come."
1,This looks nothing like it does in the picture . Very misleading,I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
2,hannah montana clock,my daughter loves this clock. She's 7 and wanted to start waking up by herself. It works!
2,jansport backpack,"It's a great book bag. Very roomy, and sturdy. The pattern is pretty: young teens adore it!! Price is fair for this item."
2,JanSport backpack a hit,"Great backpack! My son goes through them like you would not believe. This time, I think he'll have no choice but to make this one last!"
2,Perfect!,I've used Jansport backpacks for years and the quality is great. I wanted to find a rare color so I purchased it in Light Purple Passion and love it! The color was slightly different as I thought the strap/padding part of it was black but it turned out to be a dark violet & the strings to the zipper were striped not solid. Even though it wasn't the same as shown (not really a good thing) I ended up liking it better than the sample picture.
2,High School Backpack,"I especially love the color of this backpack, it is very cute, however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks. Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack."
2,receive faster than i expected,The product is nice and I got it faster than I expected. Very nice purchase experience!
1,Bag is here as it is but the fabric is cut from the top.,I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it. Problem is it's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag. This is not what i really imagined to get.
2,It's fresh!,"My bag has remained fresh since its still wrapped in plastic, but everyone should know what to expect from Jansport bags: durability, comfort and versatility."
1,light duty backpack,"Purchased it for junier high school student. it's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be. Overall, it's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you don't like it after receiving. Will not buy those bag anyway."
2,Great Backpack!,"Great Backpack! Love the color! The only thing, is that it gets dirty easily. I got a pen mark on the pocket, and I'm not sure how to remove it :("
2,"""Kim...hits the spot""","I remember years ago, riding on a bus, listening to the radio. ""Kim the Waitress"" came on and I was blown away by what an excellent song this was. The feel of the song, as well as the instruments used during it were absolutely intriguing. The fact that such simple lyrics can be transformed into such a revolutionary ballad is inspiring! So anyhow, years went by and I became content with the fact that I would never pin down the artist of this wonderful song. But...I did. And I listened to the rest of this brilliant cd, and was blown away by it as as well. Go figure!"
1,Not up to the standards of the first two LPs!,"Freak City Soundtrack finds our Chicago lads getting a little too close to their Marshall stacks - The Jesus & Mary Chain would be jealous of the feedback that permeates this record.For those who thought International Pop Overthrow was a little too candy-coated, you'll definitely get your fill of crunchy guitars on this one.The late Jim Ellison does a great job of taking the pi** out of ""guitar gods"" with his one-note solo during ""Help Me Land.""Still, I'd try IPO or DU (if you can find them) before FCS. Why these MI CDs go out of print in under five years while record companies continue to churn out copies of fossils like ""The Best Of Cat Stevens"" is beyond me."
1,Static in My Ears is more like it,"I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is, a local Cleveland band. And that's about as far as SOB is ever going to get by writing songs like this. If you enjoy thin sounding music created with Casio keyboards and lyrics that are reminiscent of sixth grade theatrics, then you'll more than likely enjoy the tracks on this disc. I had a problem just getting past the weak and monotone vocals.This disc did absolutely nothing for me. Other than make me wish that I were deaf.On a positive note, the lead singer is kinda cute."
1,Stuck in old Testament,I always liked Davids first books and was looking forward to reading the 2 end times books he wrote but his proof text is all old Testament and has NOTHING to do with America in fact the verses he used was spoken by the prophets for Israel only and not the Church. It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.
1,"Sad, Sad.....","Mr. Wilkerson is, as far as I can tell, a decent and sincere Christian man. This book, however, is a strange trip into whacko-land!The Bottom Line: This book is full of ""prophecies"" that are obviously false. Time has been cruel to the Pastor's prognostications. Big thumbs down."
2,LOVE IT!!,"Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this."
1,In a nutshell,"This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it. I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark."
2,Plugged it in ... Next thing I know I am Connected.,"Install the drivers, shut down, plug it in, boot back up and Windows knows right where the drivers are. Then suddenly it's installed and I am connected to my router. After being connected I went in and configures WEP to work and all those fancy things.I like this card and was surprised at how easily and quickly I was connected with a nice strong signal. My desktop is upstairs, but the wireless access point is downstairs. This card still gets a good signal."
1,Careful: Will Freeze Up Your Machine,"My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally, the installation manual had erroneous information in it. Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience, and that just about sums up D-Link. I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality, dependability, and reliability of their products."
1,One of the worst films I&#65533;ve ever seen,"When Snipes is playing in a film, I'll routinely pick it up, confident that it won't be bad and might be terrific --- he's done some great stuff. Sadly, this film is an unbroken string of cliche laden dialogue, actions and plot lines. I watched it for 25 minutes before going to Amazon's Reader's Reviews, which is what I usually do before taking out a film. If I had done so, it would have saved me some money and 25 minutes of my time. Mystery Science Theater 2000's Robot and Servo would have had a field day with this flick. It's bad enough to get their undivided attention."
1,Snipes can do better!,"This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins. The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin. The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state. The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action. Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the ""who-done-it"" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable. Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I love Wesley Snipes, I have enjoyed many of his movies, but this is one is really really bad. It is painful to watch this film, if you can even call it that. The only part of this movie I found cool was the credit sequence at the beginning and the opening shot. The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose. The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown. The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly. The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable. The one-liners made me cringe. The conversations between the characters is the same old, same old. This movie is completely unwatchable, and I recommend you don't watch as it will destroy your respect for Wesley, which no one want to happpen."
1,WTF,"I am very, very, very confused as to how this movie is getting an average of 3.5 stars.Now I can understand that some aspects of a cluttered film like this one can be appealing to some but I have no clue as to how somebody could derive enjoyment from the plot. The movie played like a broken record: nick cage would complain (in a voice over) about his fat balding body, his brother (also nick cage) would talk for awhile then main character nick cage would try an aspect of the story and end up masterbating.This must have happened five or six times in the film with parts about the wirting of the book that this crap movie is based on. I don't see how the production studio could get away with the plot they used. They portrey the actual writer of the book (a very real person) as a insecure, ugly, drug attic who tries to kill the brothers (It's a shame she coulden't didn't succeed sooner).In Conclution this movie was a piece of sh**. save yourself some money and skip this one."
1,Where to start?,"This movie was so slow and long. Once you finally reach the last 45 minutes, you have reached the best part of the whole movie. Just let this movie run while you are busy doing something else."
1,More Hollywood Schlock,"Yet another braindead, hollow, formulaic Hollywood concoction with the standard ingedients: load up on bankable stars, throw tons-o-money at it, pump up the ""buzz"" and voila!, another Hollywood blockbuster.I can't believe all the hype surrounding this movie. An inane script with absolutely nothing important to say about anything. And what's with all the buzz surrounding the Kaufman's? You'd think they were the Next Coming the way critics go on and on about their supposed brilliance. It amazes me to see how much praise is bestowed upon writers whose only strength is their cleverness. As if being clever constitutes great screenwriting. Does ""Memento"" ring a bell?"
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"I have attempted to watch this movie twice. After getting part way through it both times, longer through the second time just to force ourselves to give it more of a chance, we shut it off due to the fact that we were so incredibly bored.I have absolutely no understanding of what any of you, who liked it, see in this movie. Perhaps it gets better, but when over half of the movie is dead, I don't see how it could."
1,Might be the only one but I hated it.,"From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone else loved this film more than I did. I wanted to leave the cinema (two of my friends did) when I went to see it. I found the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper well acted and touching but I was irritated by the parts of the film that featured Nicolas Cage's character, Charlie. For me it was almost as if he was getting in the way and I left the cinema with the distinct impression that I would have enjoyed it much more if I had simply read the book."
1,"Over-rated, lame-arsed-pomo dreck...","Well, at least Kaufman seems to know that he can't write a third act to save his (or his fictional brother's) life. The emperor is officially desnudo, my friends."
1,"don't be fooled, this movie is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!","like many unfortunate souls out there, i had heard how great adaptation was, blah blah blah. i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life. i'm writing this for one reason only: to try to stop you from doing the same. believe me, even bill and ted's is a better film. this movie is pathetic."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie was BY FAR the worst movie I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, that is not an exaggeration. When I saw it, I went for free to the Sneak preview screening compliments of my local radio station, so I didn't actually waste any money on this atrocity (thank the gods). However, It was so utterly bad that I felt I had still been wronged for having wasted my TIME having gone. In addition, this movie has in fact ruined Nicholas Cage for me FOREVER, I cannot take him seriously anymore. The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie. If I had a copy, I would not sell it, I would BURN IT!!!"
1,watch something else,Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his interpretation(s) but I can't understand how this movie can get 5 stars... it is boring boring boring and quite ridiculous in some scenes.
1,This is horrible,"I'm sorry, there is something very sick about this CD. These kids have absolutely no talent and sing about things like insects stealing your food. Whoever created this CD has made a mockery of ""mentally challenged"" kids everywhere. I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this, but....I'm afraid it's impossible"
2,Fast Music From Slow Kids,"The next time Bono or Scott Weiland whine about how being a rock star is some sort of elitist job, I want to huck one of these kickass CDs into their heads and kill them. As for the band, all I can say is wow."
1,What a Joke,I have to say that I don't feel I need to say this music is good because these kids are retarded. I laugh every time i listen to this. I feel bad for the people with normal mentality who produce it and play the instruments for these kids. HILARIOUS. All the people who say its good are probably just a bunch of single white females with no lives who complain about everything and blame violence on t.v and video games.This CD sucks. But it gets me laughing
1,THE MUSIC KINDA BLOWZ,It just wasn't good i do better sometimes it was funny though so maybe it's worth buyin you know!
2,Peony,Bought this book to read for book club. It is very interesting and believable. The club enjoyed it as well.
2,Awesome Access Point with 802.11g speeds,"This AP has some good quality features. Filtering, WEP, soon WPA, and more. I have this plugged into my 4 port router and now I can access the Internet with my laptop and DWL-G650 (wireless adapter for laptop). These two products give me great range (throughout the house, and even outside), good security, and a reliable wireless connection. This is all I need for a small price."
2,Fantastic!,Beautiful Music! Its like a magical evening with pitch perfect angels singing to you! I highly endorse this! 2 thumbs up!
1,DONT READ!!!!,This book is the downer of the century. Just when you think something is going to happen BAM!!!! the book is over. I accidently finished the book. Thats pathetic! Most fiction has a rising action that is not present in this book. Its a great book about nothing.
1,"If I believed in burning books, this would be the only one I'd torch","This stands as the longest work of ""literature"" I have ever been forced to read. Not due to the page count, as it is actually rather (mercifully) short; it is merely the most monotonous and plodding work of fiction ever published, in any language. When I read the book, I had hoped for a punchline - at some point the story would actually take form and progress. Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch. Its only merit is that it is a prime example of what aspiring writers should NEVER produce. If this book were distributed in Guantanamo, Amnesty International would object, and rightly so. This is the pinnacle of academic torture, and those who assign it should be investigated, very closely."
1,Awful Literature,"I'd give this book 0 stars if possible, it was a horrendous read, a truly awful book that is forced upon high schoolers everywhere."
1,Not Suggested for the Clinically Depressed,"And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed, you will be after reading this novel. Seriously, I did not find the novel either a) beautiful or b) worth reading. Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong. The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors. Perhaps, if the storyline of the book were my life, it would depress me very much. The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable, but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact. I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel, unless you have a flair for masochism."
1,Wharton gets her point across,"If I were to use four words to review this book, they would be: ""thank goodness it's over"". I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic ""lovers' pact"" set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there. I recommend staying very far away from this novella."
1,Ethan Frome,It's classics like this one that discourage me from reading classics! and if I have to come up with additional words: here they are!
1,"AWFUL, BORING, DONT READ!","I decided to read this book after seeing it on a list of supposed classics and the positive reviews here on amazon. Boy do i regret it.I am now wondering what is the criteria for labeling a book ""classic"" because i can not appreciate ANYTHING from this book. Watching paint dry would be a better way to pass the time.I'm also starting not to trust the postive reviews on Amazon since this the second time i've been burned by you guys (Huxley's ""Island"" also sucked)"
1,The WORST book in the history of ink!!!,... Ethan Frome is a worm with no backbone who was afraid to stand up to his overbearing wife. Period!! The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. ... This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading. After reading this piece of garbage you'll wish you were illiterate!!.
1,Times have changed,"When Edith Wharton wrote ""Ethan Frome,"" long, long passages of exposition were perfectly acceptable fiction. That's changed. No one who doesn't have to read this book will read it. A pity; they'll miss out on Wharton's lucid and luminous prose. But for today's reader, it's a dull, dry book."
1,How BORING!,This book was so detailed - i don't know how someone could drag out a 48 hour period of time into 9 chapters. Very detailed and drawn out. If you dont have to read it don't.
2,Wonderful reference!,"It is really a shame this book is out of print! I have had my students read it for in-depth, inner knowledge of the Supreme Court. It is a book that holds the interest of the reader whike giving factual information about our highest court. Now I must find some sort of alternative, equally as intriguing. I truly wish the publisher would consider returning the book to print!"
1,I tried hard but I failed,"It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it, every time! Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner. Doesn't matter if she's a Nobel Prize winner, if this is her style, I don't think we'll ever click."
2,Sweet and depraverd,"Saint Reverend Jen, partron saint of the uncool, makes the Lower East Side, tenement to the world, seem like shangrila. She has a way of making the depraved seem sweet and the bizarre seem like common sense. This guide may not tell you what beds Washington slept in, but it may tell you what beds you can."
2,Should be a good read,"Hi! I'm a teenager that was in a small group (called a ""D""-group) in which Wendy was my leader. She's a very gifted writer and a strong Christian, and her books are fun to read and interesting. I would definitely recommend it."
2,They don't make great classic movies like this any more !!!,Trail Of Robin Hood is a great movie with Roy Rogers and my favorite actresses is Penny Edwards. I feel all these movies need to come out into theatres again so people can take a step back in time to remember and see the greatest actors & actresses in the world.
2,"Groovy, funky, out of control good!!!!","I purchased this album after hearing ""slide"" on download.com. That song is so slick that I assumed the rest of the cd must be good. I was right!!! Kind of reminds me of Vikter Duplaix meets Van Hunt. Got some r&b grooves, some dance/funky house. Some uncategorizable tracks as well but it is all nicely done."
2,Nice Booster!,"This is a wonderful backless booster seat. Much more plush than most you find for sale. Light weight, comfy, and nice fun color. My daughter loves it!"
1,$3 Bucks Down the Drain - Just Awful,I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!! TOTALLY TRASH
1,Volleygal,"If I could leave zero stars, I would. I picked this up thinking it was de Palmas Dahlia- what a complete waste of time... I forwarded through most of it..not sure why...I guess I was hoping I hadn't wasted my money. Please don't encourage this guy to make any more movies...seriously, it was awful."
1,"TERRIBLE, UNWATCHABLE GORE FEST","I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 ""versions"" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon. Wrong. Just avoid this movie it is really awful."
1,Everybody Dies,"John Cusack and Ray Liotta, amongst others, get lost in a motel in the middle of nowhere. It`s a rainy, obscure night, and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason. As each character dies, the closer we are to descovering who the murderer is...This James Mangold`s thriller (""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Kate and Leopold"") has a few nice twists and surprises, but the character development isn`t strong enough to make us care much and the multiple changes on the last part only make it worse. It has a suspenseful atmosphere, competent acting and neat direction, though the final result doesn`t step above average. A decent, schizophrenic thriller, but nothing great or terribly exciting. Watchable."
1,Ghostly Court,"In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a kind of round table court proceedings surely.What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably."
2,wow - a film that's scary and smart at the same time,"I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie more than once...unless you're looking for clues that give away the ending. However, I found that although this movie might've started out as a typical horror film, ...it dosn't end that way."
1,Lame Hitchcock Ripoff Wannabe,"Even John Cusack can't save this. I expected to see something different. DO NOT BE FOOLED. This has been done before though some people believe it hasn't. This was a rip off of many Hitchcock stories as well as some horror films.PEOPLE GETTING BUMPED OFF AT RANDOM: Original...not!KILLER WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES: Been there, seen that!A BUNCH OF PEOPLE STRANDED TOGETHER: What did they use a generic script?Maybe, just maybe I'd give an A for effort if this hadn't been so boring. This is definitely one of the most disappointing films I've seen. Nothing was original. The director and writers tried to imitate Hitchcock's brilliance and failed miserably. Word to the wise: DON'T MESS WITH THE MASTER.Skip this or you'll regret it. The only thing good about this film was Rebecca DeMornay. Even she couldn't rescue it."
2,PSA: Skip other guy's review below-it gives away the ending!,"Public service announcement: If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not read the review below entitled ""Seems interesting, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK"" as the mental midget who wrote it exposes the twist and gives away the ending. What a moron!By the way, the film isn't bad, but not great. Not as mind-bending as Memento or Usual Suspects, but better than many so-called thrillers floating around out there. As mentioned above though, the film does fail Psychology 101."
1,Identity crisis,"John Cusack is always great, Rebecca DeMornay's few minutes onscreen are well done, and Ray Liotta delivers as expected, but I'm really surprised they all agreed to work on this film. What a disappointment. Anytime you find yourself laughing when yet another character is murdered in some tired old horror movie fashion, it's time to hit the stop button. Even when you realize that everyone with a room key is going to die, it isn't suspenseful or even an issue because you don't really like them anyway, and they certainly don't care much about each other. The ""plot twist"" at the end is a total cop out and fairly predictable. (Wasn't it 20 years ago that Bobby dreamed an entire season of Dallas?) Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I'd watched the alternative ending(s), but the final version was more than enough for me."
1,UMM.... WHAT CAN I SAY?,"First off, was she her own editor? Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book, the more I read the madder I got. Most of the time the book didn't make sense. I paid way too much for this book and it was only 100 some pages, and it didn't have any kind of meaning. I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy Fly on the Wall by Trista Russell it's better and cheaper."
2,Buzz words and phrases,"Back in the 70s this group became legend among musicians of every genre at the time. We found hundreds of ways to filter lines from these recordings into every day situations and never got tired of listening to this hilarious spoof that took every one of us back to the days of southern local radio shows that our parents listened to religiously in the 50s. Like all satire, it's not that much of a stretch from the reality of what those shows were really like. This is one of those moments in time that just can't and won't be duplicated ever again. A diamond in the rough, indeed."
2,Good ole' boys playin' for 'em good ole' boys,"In the words of ole' Roadhog himself this record is ""mighty fine"". I heard these guys live when they opened for the Stafford Brothers and Mother Mayball Carter last Winter down to the Johnny Mack Brown Highschool gym and was imeadiately impressed. All I can say is buy as many copies of this country classic as you can get yer hands on before it goes out of print.Five stars jist aint enough, Thanks boys and keep on a'singin'"
2,British Science Fiction At Its Best!,"Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book ""The Midwich Cuckoos."""
2,I FEEL HER PAIN!,"When I first heard this song I was startled! This song sounds like it really came from deep inside her heart. We've all been hurt my men in ourlives..and yes we all feel like SCREAMING ""I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ..I SYMPATHIZE. Every time I hear her song I BLAST IT!..So I can hear her scream to her full extent. She is awsome! I recommend this to all women who have been deceived and lied to by men. Womens National Anthem!"
1,Let's Tear Down This Wahl,"HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it's cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it's not close.....takes 15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it's a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn't too bad and it's all down hill from there."
2,Great Selection,"I have to say that I like Rhino and Varese Sarabande's CDs so much more that the slapped-together compilations that I find in the ""cheap racks"" at Tower (and other stores). This CD has a ton of great '80s hits on it...and the liner notes are really fact-filled, too. Get this and the Rhino New Wave CDs...you'll be set for your '80s fix!"
2,We love it,I use it to decorate my sons's bedroom. There's not much dr Seus decorations stuffs on the market. But I did it with this and other stuffs and looks awesome. Ans my son loves his room.
2,Spice Girls In America Was An Awesome Documentary!,"The Spice Girls new video is Girl Power packed, funny and entertaining all at the same time. It's like Spice World, but not scripted! This movie rocks!"
1,never gonna come,well i ordered this and everything went good.well until they called me and said they were out of stock for at least 4-6 weeks.and in the status it said shipped but i guess it wasnt.and they still havent put out of stock on the page.so im trying to help u out of a month and a half wait.DONT BUY THIS!!!
2,AMAZING AIRSOFT GUN,I love this gun. I'm a new guy for airsoft and this gun help me so good.When I was fighting with my airsoft gun I bit evrybody in 4 seconds it's an AMAZING GUN.It's a good product.I think evrybody can buy this gu if you have money and I think a lotof people wish to have it.YOU CAN BUY IT.
1,Can only be used with full zoom,"The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight."
2,Pretty good,"I liked this book. Precise, easy-to-follow, and a page turner. I'm interested by graphic design, and is Illustrator 10 is one of vector programs. This book is recommended if you plan to know anything about the new version."
2,The Machanic,"An excellant film shows Charles Bronson at his best the steely eyed hero out as usual to wow the watching public and as usual chooses a script to suit I think his rugged personality.Truly an actor pulling you through every twist and turn. I can thoroughly recommend this DVD as it is exciting all the way and you never know what the character is thinking before the next something else happens. A film though to watch I think on one of those rainy days with your popcorn, may be a bit slow in places but you need to get right into it to appreciate it. If you like the hitman type of film then this is it but it is not difficult sometimes to feel sorry for the victim."
1,Big Disappointment,"Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with."
2,you people...hahahahahaha,"you know, i always thought that people who review the flicks on a website were just people who are small inside, and wish to be big and important...and influence the daily lives of others like yourselves. but lately i have noticed that movies that are so good sometimes need to be reviewed about. wether it's an awesome flick or a piece of shizzah, you just want to talk about it. and yeah, it makes you feel like you're doing something...writing on the internet! being an influence on peoples movie tastes! woooo(...)! so exciting! THis movie was pretty good, and now i consider myself...one of you! NOT!"
1,Overhyped & Overrated,I seem to be one of few in my opinion of this movie which is that it's not a good movie. I felt the movie was boring and lacking of a good plot. I bought the movie believing it was a really good movie based on what I had heard but was really disapointed once I watched the movie. This movie in my opinion is very overrated.
1,Clean Slate II,"Remember the Dana Carvey comedy ""Clean Slate""? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud. The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun. Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree. Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be. A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed."
1,A Wildly Overrated Film!!,"I cannot believe how many people loved this film. It is grossly overrated. Discussions around this film center on its ""groundbreaking"" backwards structure. Well, there is a little known film from the early 1980's called ""Betrayal"" starring Jeremy Irons and Ben Kingsley. It is a film about a love triangle that is told backwards. TV's Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode. So this film is hardly groundbreaking. As for the story, I found it boring. Yet another revenge story, HO HUM. This film is just yet another variation on the Pulp Fiction influence."
2,nuF eivom,"I've read that some people find the way the intro stuff is presented -- i.e. the way you get the movie to play in your player -- to be confusing, irritating, bothersome, etc. I don't get it. It's easy, just click on ""Work"" and it goes, there are other things you can do leading to other screens and more, which I think makes it a far more interesting ""play me screen"" than the standard stuff. The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's ""The Information"" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the ""backward-drawkcab"" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end. More of a psychological movie with a little action now and then. It's not exactly breaking new ground, so I give it four out of five stars. But it is, as my title indicates, a Fun movie."
2,Engrossing and Thought Provoking To Say The Least,"Wow, what a movie...I've had a few in the past that made me go directly to the internet to see what other people thought about the ending and specific plot elements. This movie, right from the start, sucks you in and does not let you go until the ending credits roll by. I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it. You can formulate your own stance on the ending from the various events presented in the plot. A must see, and a great DVD!"
1,"Thanks robe4, for the spoilers...","This movie wasn't very good, and not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Read the above guy's review and you wan't have to waste your money on this pseudo-intellectual pig. If you want something to wrap your mind around, get Waking Life by Richard Linklater."
2,wow,what a movie if u dont loke this great movie theres somthing wrong with u its just pure genius loved this movie its on my top three next to the lord od the rings trilogy
2,A great movie.,"This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once."
2,Unforgettable.,"Great exercise for those who like to think about the films they watch. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan whose original screenplay makes the audience feels just like Pearce's character, who knows what is going to happen, but not what happened in the moment before."
2,You'll watch it over and over,"Heck, you'll have to. This movie makes you twist your mind and think around corners. After the first viewing I was wondering if the 'mystery' was ever solved! I see this as one of those great 'little' movies that are simply wonderful, like ""Slingblade."""
2,SMART MOVIE!!!,"Brilliantly made movie. Guy Pearce is outstanding. I've never seen a movie made the way this one was. It was a little hard to follow. You have to pay attention through the whole movie. If you miss one part, you may as well start from the beginning. It is well worth the staight attention you have to pay. This is one of those movies where every time you watch it, you discover something you didn't see before. This movie has such a great story to it. I absolutely love the way it was filmed and put together. Kind of a suspensful, who-done-it, sort of movie. Rent it when you have time to get the most out of it and no distractions."
1,Navigational Nightmare Extremely Frustrating,"The film is great, don't get me wrong. It is a five-star film. Just do NOT buy this special edition without being warned. The ""special"" part of this is that the director made it almost impossible to actually watch the movie. All of the great extra features on the disc 2 are not available unless you figure out some sort of puzzle and answer random questions the way that the director thinks they should be answered.There are cheat sheets for navigating the menus available on the web, but you really shouldn't have to do a Google search in order to watch something that you paid for!"
2,One of the most original and satisfying movies ever made,"Just effing brilliant. The type of movie you can watch over and over again, not necessarily to learn new things, but the very concept leads to thought-provoking inner dialogues about the nature of the self, the soul, time, and memory. The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!) What role does his subconscious play in his actions? Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions? Do we even have a subconsious? What will his future hold? How can he live? A masterpiece that should have won some Oscars."
1,The hours....,"What an awful, awful movie! Flitting through 3 lives, we discover 3 miserable people. No reason for this movie but to waste an hour and a half. The potential of these actors together would have been awesome but they were wasted on a trash movie."
1,Nicole Kidman? Who?,"Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were equally as good if not better than Nicole Kidman in this movie. I really have to wonder why the academy gave the oscar only to Kidman.And... as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses, I found myself thinking, ""Who is that Nicole Kidman?"" She looks nothing like the Kidman I know today, December 22nd, 2004. What did she do to her face? Botox? Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat. THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film. The faded blonde hair of late, the flat eyebrows and expressionless brow take the uncommon beauty out of her.I gave this movie two stars for Mel Harris, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Kidman. It was a mesmerizing film, but it was ultimately too in love with itself."
1,The Hours,"I do not have much to say about movie ""The Hours"". All I will say is that I wasted an hour of my life on watching it in theaters. This movie is short, dull, boring, and its about deeply trouble lesbians. The critics out there must be crazy! They are hailing this movie as best picture of the year! Give me a break! It shocks me to hear that this dull movie has actually been nominated for nine Academy Awards! This movie is terrible. I do NOT recommend you watch it."
1,serious technical flaws,"audio and visual faults made this otherwise interesting story impossible to enjoy. I have had the same problems with other videos and don't know if the problem lies with my computer or, if the issue is with the download function."
1,"pretentious drivel, but oh so significant!","pretentious and obvious and oh-so-significant; in other words, is this not the PERFECT movie for meryl streep? a big disappointment from stephen daldry, after the wonderful debut as film director in ""billy elliott"". nicole kidman won one of the most undeserved oscars since luise rainer, nd i usually like her. and oh god, theres that ""important"" philip glass score ..."
1,Only because there is no 0-star ranking,"This movie is absolutely dreadful. I am sure that there are a lot of people out there who love this movie (I know some of them), but if you are looking for a plot or decent acting, skip it and buy something else. With such a great cast, this movie should provide more...Streep looks incredibly bored throughout the movie and I just can't get past that horrible nose on Kidman. Just awful."
1,High expectations unmatched by reality,"After all of Meryl Streep's successes we had just about concluded that If Meryl Streep was in the movie, it would be a winner especially when you add in the rest of the remarkable cast. Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a maelstrom of depression feeding on depression. We could not even finish the film. Others may see some redeeming qualities that we missed."
2,Streep Deserved the Oscar,"While it took me more than one viewing of this film to understand its focus, I believe that Streep's performance was far better than that of Kidman's who won, by a nose (pun intended)! Kidman's part seemed to consist of a lot of hard to understand mumbling."
2,A JOURNEY THROUGH PARIS,"Polemic Polanski made a decent kind of thriller, with good action and good plot twists. Great climax, also."
1,"Good movie, bad DVD","I would love to buy this movie on DVD, but only after good features have been added. First of all, widescreen. No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio. Second, this Paris-based movie should have full French language support. I checked other regions for this DVD and it *is* available in widescreen with French, but not here in Region 1 (where both English and French are official languages -- both languages should be supported in both audio and subtitles on all Region 1 DVDs). Other DVD features, such as audio commentaries, featurettes, and other forms of information, would be much appreciated."
1,Could be better,Should have been written as acceptable or even worse. Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed.
2,Timeless book,A light but inspiring read. Insightful and encouraging. This is 'hope' in a book for women with a style crisis.
1,Very poor piece of work,I bought this CD to listen to the sound or rain and thunderstorms. You can hardly hear the rain and thunderstorms for the much louder and very poor overlay of very poor music.
1,I only give it 1 star because that's the lowest you can go!,"This is NOT what I expected at all. I simply wanted a cd with the sounds of a rain storm...that's it. I didn't expect to get some cheesy music played very poorly. You can barely hear the rain over the music. The CD states that it's ""Rain Storms: Sounds of Nature."" Any person should be able to safely assume this does not include music. I guess I assumed wrong. Don't buy this."
2,A Good Soundtrack For a Movie I've Never Seen!,"There's an interesting story behind my decision to get this soundtrack. A few years back, I saw a David Cooperfield special and he did an illusion that had a song that was unmistakably done by U2 because I recognized Bono's voice. Of course I didn't know the song title, and it doesn't appear on any of their albums. So I looked through Amazon and came across this album. After listening to a sample, that was all I needed to place my order.Now the question is was it worth it? The answer is yes! ""In The Name of The Father"" and ""Billy Bola"" are two cool songs by Bono, The two classics ""Voodoo Child"" and ""Dedicated Follower of Fasion"" are great, plus the instrumential pieces are very good. ""You Made Me The Thief of Your Heart"" sounds like something from one of those ""Pure Moods"" albums and rounds off the album perfectly.Of course one of these days I'll have to check out the movie."
2,All time favorite,"I bought this soundtrack 8 years ago and is still one of favorite ever. I have always been a big U2 and Bono fan, but this CD introduced me to the music of Trevor Jones. This and the Last of the Mohicans soundtrack CD contains some of the best musical pieces I have ever heard. The favorite being ""Walking in Circle""."
2,The Rainbow and the Rose; Revisited,"I read The Rainbow and The Rose , along with most of Nevil Shute's novels, many years ago. Interestingly, I've never read On The Beach. I have, however, recently begun buying copies of Shute's novels for rereading. I wish to see if my sixty year old personna interprets them differently than I did as an eighteen year old.At the time I first read The Rainbow and The Rose, I thought it as good as A Town Like Alice. I could not wait for Ron Clarke to become airborne once again, as he made his way across Australia, so that he would continue to experience the visions that were some sort of gift to help him sort out his feelings toward the woman he once loved and the man who'd won her heart so many years ago.I thought back then, and I think today that the book would make a wonderful movie, if done correctly and with the right people.I urge anyone with even a passing interest in Shute's work to read The Rainbow and The Rose."
2,Great for my 3 year old,Great movie- my 3 year old loves this series and it was in good rewind condition. Good price & delivery time = thanks !!!
2,Good And Very Entertaining,My 5 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this whole series. She wants to watch them over and over. They all seem to have great lessons and messages for kids to learn. This one was good and very entertaining.
1,The Time of Great Confusion,"I couldn't understand if they were speaking language or else not. Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if this is how those graceful creatures spoke to each other. Although this movie was a bit too artsy for me, I still thought it was pretty good even though I couldn't understand what they were saying. Overall, this is my third favorite Land Before Time movie, only the seventh and the ninth are much better. Littlefoot still rules the Jurassic Period."
1,Grandmother,"Not a good movie for young children, very sassy, bullies and bad language for young children. You wonder where they get some of the things they say these days....well examples like this movie."
2,Typical Christie....Awesome...,"Ok, there is little point reviewing an Agatha Christie mystery. It would be equivalent to saying that Kasparov plays a good game of chess, or that Mike Tyson hits hard. You just know that Dame Christie can spin a great yarn of intrigue, and this is no exception. Pocket Full of Rye beings with a dead body (with a pocket full of rye no less!) and suspects aplenty. As it turns out, almost everyone in the house had a reason for offing poor Mr. Fortescue. Then more murders occur, which by definition one would think would make the mystery easier to solve as there are less suspects. However, Ms. Christie is too clever for that, and much as in And Then There Were None, the reader is baffled until the very end.My only [small] complaint is that Miss Marple is a relatively small part of the novel, and it would have been nice to see a tad more of her.Relic113"
2,A Complete Guide To Float Hunting Alaska,"I was fortunate enough to meet Larry at a book signing recently. He gave a slide presentation which included many photos of his hunting experiences. The photos and advice shared that evening were enough to motivate me to buy and read his book. Once complete, I was chomping at the bit to get on an Alaskan river. The book's resources are endless, as are the maps and details of where to go and how to get there. His knowledge of Alaska's rivers and animals certainly makes him ""the"" hunter to write this kind of book. Wow!"
2,The dogs love them... yes they smell but so do dogs...,My dogs love these things... have ordered several times... people say they stink... of coure they do... who cares... I Just ordered more...
2,Good Start - Predictable Finish,"This film had some very intriquing elements to it. Kate Winslet was solid and Kevin Spacey was excellent. The direction by Alan Parker gave it the eerie elements that keep you uneasy throughout. However, as the story unfolds it becomes somewhat predictable where it is heading. This cheapens the ending but the film is still worth seeing."
2,Political,"Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet star in ""The Life of David Gale"" as a death row inmate and a news reporter. They carry their emotions gracefully giving this movie the emotion it needs. The writers found a unique style to darken death row more than the average movie. The debates about politics are eye opening to many. The editors add handwritten words and images to desplict the intensity of the next scene. The many surprises will keep the audience watching every scene closely wondering what will happen next. Those who look away for a second will not understand the rest of the movie unless they rewind it. The end has the biggest surprise(shhhhh). Afterward, one will not be disappointed, rather enlightened."
2,"Excellent,thought provoking,thriller!","Although,the critics did not like this movie,that just proves that not all xritics should speak for the movie going public!I really loved this film.Great personal political film without making it seem so boringly political.Kevin Spacey is wonderful as a brillent UT professor who is an advocate for saving death penelty inmates from well...death.His partner in crime is a wonderful Laura Linney who is more passionate in her goal to abolish the death penelty.Kevin Spacey finds himself accused of Rape and Murder and with 3 days left to live.Kate Winslet is the reporter that gets sucked into his story.Kate Winslet is by far the best asset to the film.It is wonderful to see her just use her amazing talent in jeans and without a corset or taking her clothes off!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,good movie,I Think this was a very good movie. I only give it 4 stars because of some of the scenes..they were meant for teenagers..sex scense and a naked chick i know it was suppose to look like a rape but they could have made the movie with her clothes on ew! But there was good acting..good plot..and a very suprising ending! GOOD JOB
2,encouraging poster for REAL women,"this poster with marilyn monroe on a bench press is quite sweet, everyone at our gym soo loves it that i bought it as a gift for a friend who got a new house. should make a nice addition to his gym. i here tell she was a size 14 or 12 ... not a 2;)"
1,Nothing more than I know before,Absolutely basic information about boat interior.Good for beginers.Information about table chart and equipments are very old. We have XXI st century
2,Great shovel for the trunk of your car...,"If you park in the street or want to have all the winter gear in your trunk, this is a good choice. It takes little trunk space, but can move quite a bit of snow."
1,Bizarro Humming/Singing Ruined It For Me,"I like a lot of Keith Jarrett's music and the music on this CD is great -- UNTIL you hear Mr. Jarrett start bleating out off-key humming/singing, which ruined the CD for me and made me dump it off my ipod. Sometimes it's not too audible, but once I noticed it I couldn't focus on the music anymore. Too bad -- be forewarned. Wish I had taken the reviewers' comments more seriously (instead I went by the glowing 5-star review from the All Music Guide to Jazz)."
2,Deleted Scenes make it worth it,This movie has been one of my favorites for several years. Being able to view the deleted scenes was a great way to see more of what Rob Reiner was trying to create with this picture.The 'making of' special that is also included on the DVD was excellent as well. Provided plenty of comments from Rob and Nora giving an excellent view into the creative minds behind this wonderful picture. I already own this on VHS but had to add the DVD to my collection. I am glad I did.
2,"Not just another ""chick flick""","This is the standard to which all modern ""romantic-comedies"" should be held. This is a truly funny and romantic movie, without being too sentimental or sappy. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have wonderful chemistry, the writing and acting is sharp, and most of all--this movie is laugh-out-loud FUNNY. Too often, movies of this genre are way to weepy and cute to interest most men (and a lot of women). This movie keeps the tone light and realistic, and the humor is sarcastic and clever, so that everyone should enjoy this wonderful story. And yes, the diner scene is a classic...I laugh at the woman's line at the end of the scene every time."
1,Yawwwwwn,"I am probably not the person to review this movie. I think Billy Crystal has about as much acting talent as a ball of lint. No human male actually acts like that, but, hey, it's only a movie. A ""chick"" movie! I did not laugh once. This was supposed to be a comedic love story, wasn't it? Well, it wasn't. If you are female, you will love this flick. If not, find an excuse, any excuse, not to see this movie."
1,a contrived cliche,"yuck. i really hate this film. first of all, it's as if ANNIE HALL was remade as a television sitcom. ANNIE HALL is a much better movie! It's a classic. This one is hopelessly mediocre and it dates really badly. The second reason I hate this film is how it engages in all this ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Uranus"" nonsense. The gender roles are so boring - the man who is dark and cynical (his name is BURNS - how profound! and obvious too!) and the woman who is bright and cheery (and whoa what a surprise - her name is Albright!) Relationships are complicated. They don't work this way. This is hollywood fantasy at its worst. It's dangerous because it dupes people into believing that their lives will end up like the ones they see on screen when the sad fact of the matter is - most marriages end in divorce and there is no such thing as happily ever after.do i sound cynical? i'm really not. and before anyone accuses me of anything, i've been happily married for ten years. so there."
1,You'll need a shower after this one...,"If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car?? Anyway, just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy getting stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial ""wazoo"". Just don't see it. Wait, I take that back! See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. He's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, other than that...wow...BAD."
1,Hard Read,"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter"
2,Very Stylish Sneakers,"I gave my 3.5 year old daughter, whose favorite color is pink, a pair of these for Christmas. They are adorable and, as my daughter puts it, ""extra fancy."" So far they seem comfortable, too."
2,good movie,"Bought this as a gift, receipient requested it and said she enjoyed it, so that's good enough for me. Happy New Year."
2,satisfying and fun,great movie with Depp as Sam who falls for Joon played by Masterson who is mentally ill and who has an older brother played by Aidan Quinn. wonderfully acted with Depp doing great bits. for his loving women fans. a not to be missed Depp film I might add.
2,An odd wonderful dramatic romantic comedy.,"An Normal but Mentally Ill Artist named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) falls in love with a Odd Quirky Outsider named Sam (Johnny Deep), who has the Talent and does Tribute to his favorite Comedian Star:Buster Keaton. But her Over-Protective Brother named Benny (Aidan Quinn), who doesn`t want her to be seen with Sam but the love between Sam and Joon is Stronger than anyone think.Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (The Avengers) has made a Bittersweet Romantic Comedy. This film has a great supporting cast-Including:Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt, C.H.H. Pounder, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi and William H. Macy. This is a Rare Film, which has become a classic genuine film. Grade:A-."
2,Benny and Joon DVD,This is a wonderful movie. It arrived within a few days in perfect condition and was packaged with care to the contents. We are very pleased and would recommend this seller.
2,Benny and Joon,"I'd forgotten what a great movie this is! Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Aidan Quinn are fabulous. This most untraditional romance will really touch your heart."
2,I love this movie,Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie. It always makes me laugh and cry no matter how many times i have seen it. The sister ya she is a lil off but Sam fell for her and her brother Benny is skeptical and overly protective of his sister. Its a great story and makes a great addition to any house hold collection.
2,Great CD!!!,"I bought this CD the day I went to go see the movie. The whole CD is wonderful, but the Faith Hill song is the only letdown on this CD. I recommend getting this CD, but when you do, don't listen to the first song."
1,hans falls short on this one!!,"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!"
1,Viva Plant protector net,"Even though I ordered the largest size of netting protector, it did not cover even 1/2 the diameter. I have a potted tree in a very large pot that I did not want my young sons (1yr & 2yr) getting into. So I ordered this product thinking this will solve my problem, but it did not fit and tore rendering the product completely useless and big waste of money! The sizes need to be specific to the diameters of the pots so that you can measure. I am now back to my original home made cover which is a giant plastic plant water catcher that I cut in half with some heavy weights on top to keep the plastic on. Looks bad when not covered by a tree skirt, but it works!"
2,Working Windows Works,"... It arrived on Friday, and was an easy read, with lots of diagrams and helpful hints. On Sunday I attacked a 73 year old double hung window which had been painted shut for decades, and everything I encountered was just as described in the book. By the end of the day, the window had been reassembled and both sashes now function properly. My total out of pocket cost was less than $20, including enough materials to do several other windows. To make this review a ""5"" the author should include a reference list of where to find those ""hard to find"" parts (including internet URL's)."
1,"Thoughtless, effortless, just bad","Maybe I could take a great song by a great band, such as Girlfriend - July For Kings, and sing my own version. Ordinarily that wouldn't really get anyone anywhere, but if you are on TV and plug your CD, then I guess it might. Reasons not to buy this CD.... 1) His first single isn't his. 2) He was the bachelor, not the American Idol. 3) July For Kings has a much better cd for a lower price due to the lack of Hype. 4) Clay Aiken puts this guy to shame. 5) His pretty-boy face, not that pretty. 6) The CD consists of thoughtless effortless jargon babbled with the intention of making money. 7) This album is awful. 8) Those who recommend this CD say things such as ""what a hottie"" ""he sang so well on the bachelor"" ""he wrote all his own mateial"" all of which doesn't make any sense. 9) He is awful 10) You could spend the money on stuff that isnt so.....awful, such as underwear that is three sizes too small, or maybe ear muffs."
1,Horrible Attempt at Music,"If you're a delusional fan of 'Bachelor Bob', it rocks!!!!For anyone else, it's easy to see why Bob Guiney never made a career in music. His sound is described as being similar to John Mayer, yet Mayer has considerable talent. I would call him more of a poor man's combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms. No tracks stand out, although I'm sure 'Girlfriend' will get some airplay when the album gets a full release. It has a feel of an album written 10 years ago, with a sound that's been heard and passed by.If you like John Mayer, buy his album. He has talent.Save time and buy it used in a $1 bin."
1,fake,"if i were all of u wanting to buy this cd, i wouldnt. cause he dosent sing this song. a band call july for kings do and how do i know this cuase my the band started in my hometown. and i would also know cause my cousin used to drum in the band when they made the cd. so go out and get july for kings cd swim cause its the real song girlfriend its tons better"
2,Will make you laugh out loud,Reminded me a lot of some of Lewis Grizzard's work. Great travel book that you can pick back up anytime.
2,A Classic !,"I never thought about reading this book until I heard the Jimmy Buffett song ""That's What Living is to Me"". The intro of the song starts with the comment in the preface of the book by Mr. Twain,""Be Good and You Will Be Lonely"". I realized then that there must be some great substance in this book, since Jimmy had probably based several of his songs on the book. Being a good Parrothead, I read the book and now understand the substance. Twain's account of his steamboat voyage around the world is a classic. He mixes his subtle humor, clever storytelling, and sarcasm with his observations of life on this fascinating journey. If you don't have a sense of humor, this will give you one. Sometimes it will make you just grin, other times, you will laugh out loud."
2,"Kentucky's Domain of Power,Greed and Corruption",I believe Jim Murray is doing a tongue in cheek- he actually gives the book a high rating so I think his comments are teasers to get the readers in Ky to think and read the book no matter if it lowers the opinions of the Big Blue Zealots etc Honesty is never out of style-Truth can always bear being examined-Ky has had glorious times in sports but it has also had its dark ages and pages-the fans cannot just claim the good and disclaim the bad- it is all of one cloth- Ellison merely tells it like it was found in her research and definitely allows the reader to see when she has her own interpretation and leaves the reader to make their own judgements -honoring their own intellect integrity and dignity
1,Can Not Read,"Please tell me how I can, either speak to a customer service rep. or send a notice to someone. I received a book, with the proper title ""Kentucky's Domaine of Power, Greed and Corruption"", however upon opening it, I found that the contents were ""The Sighted Singer"", a book on poetry. I have no idea on what I should do. I tried to get into my account, but have forgotten my password. I followed the procedure 3-4 times, and can't get an e-mail, from you giving me the password. Please e-mail me, as what I should do.... If I don't hear from ypu soon, I know nothing to but file a dispute with American Express, which will stop the payment. I would like to have the book, but I can find no way to speak yo anyone, except through this review. I hope you can help me."
1,Defective oxy acetylene torch,This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.
2,Fantastic,"This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature) 120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday, so I'm hoping the life of it lasts or else I will need to re-review. So far so good. I'm not listening the directions though...I AM using foot salts. That's basically the whole reason I bought a foot bath. The rollers do nothing for my gigantic feet because there's no room to roll around, but the water is super deep and there's even a fill line for those of us (like me) that don't know how high it can be filled. I think I'm in love."
2,Great Foot Bath,"I purchased it as a gift, and I've been thanked a few times already! Works very well and is a big size to handle size 13's! If there would be a down side, it would be that it is heavy to lift to empty. The positives way out-weigh this one item."
1,comfortable but with problems!,"I feel comfort to try this machine.But three problems.first, it makes too much noisy.second, the machine is too big.third, according to the instruction, two rolling nodes and a pumice stone should be found in the box with the foot spa machine. But I did not find them."
2,Brookstore foot spa,"Received the foot spa and we were able to immediately start using it. The remote control is great so you can keep relaxing and not bend over to change things. The jets are nice and strong. The best part is the heated water temp. It never cools off, in fact you might have to turn the heat off and maybe back on if you stay in it long. I love this feature. Very happy with this purchase."
2,Excellent Choice,"Very good product, we used it two days now and my mother loves it. The only negative is it heats slow. It would be nice to have a sensor that advises when the water is warm instead of waiting with feet in water. Other than this, it is very well liked by her."
2,Good But With A Caution,"Although this one is fairly better than part 6,7,8 and 10, it's more like Jason channels his brain and ""heart"" through different bodies. The concept is okay but Jason only appears for like 15 minutes tops. What really boggles the mind is how did he come back to life after he was in waste in N.Y. Still, this should have been the ending leading up to his confrontation with Freddy but then came Jason X....nuff said."
1,What Were They Thinking?,"When I was younger, I was a huge fan of all the great horror series: Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, and, of course, Friday the 13th. I can watch them now and laugh, especially at this garbage to which the filmakers obviously had no idea what they were doing. This used to be a great series, but the last 4 or 5 have been a major disappointment. Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday steals basically every idea from Halloween and N.O.E.S., and it doesn't stay consistant with it's previous sequels. The plot and acting are terrible, and it never quite feels like a Friday movie, but rather a cheap imitation of one. The only good thing about this movie was the very end, and even that now seems a little silly, too."
2,far fetched but a good scare,"Just one more jason movie. Part 9 is a good one but also quite different. Now, when has jason ever transfered bodies ? He uses different victims' bodies to get around in this one. The actress Kari Keegan does a pretty fine job in acting as jason's distant blood relation. There are a couple of scenes in which this movie gets pretty disgusting. Especially in the freaky diner scene in which jason uses Kari Keegan's hot shot boyfriend's body to kill quite a few people. All in all, a good movie for a scare. If you are constant with the jason movies be all over this !"
1,garbagex9,"This movie was boring and whack again like all the friday the 13th movies were, wow not even close he just blew up and a stupid black guy ate some of his remaining's and he turned into what jason was a evil phyco this movie was so whack."
1,jason went to hell with this trash,"acting like none of the other movies happened jason goes to hell takes the series in a new and horrorible new turn. steeling from ""the thing"" jason is not unstopable he just takes over new bobies when he needs them?? huh where did that come from???? not worth the 2 for 11 dollars bin at wal-mart, just junk!!!!!!!!"
2,I liked it...,"I thought this movie was pretty good! It has more of a developing plot than some of the others in the series (such as Jason being ressurected, then killing stupid teens at camp crystal)...well to understand the plot switches, see the movie. The violence level is pretty high, so those horror fans that get squeamish should not apply (if your watching the un-rated version, but if your seeing the R-rated version, you'll be ok). I can't wait for Friday the 13th part 10 (coming soon), and unfortunatly, Jason VS Freddy has been canceled (seriously, this is not a rumor, it has been canceled)...I read all about it in a famous UK horror magazine interview..."
2,Spirit Filled Experience,"This DVD is powerful and filled with the anointing. With Michael W. Smith as the vehicle of praise, he fills the room with worship. It becomes contagious and the audience catches on fire, and in turn although the viewer is not physically present the fire passes on to them. It is a magnificent dvd in that respect. Everyone should experience it."
1,A waste of time,"Have you ever rented a movie, and about 10 minutes into (sometimes less, sometimes more) realized that you had just wasted your movie? Well, thats exactly what I did with this movie. This movie I guess was trying to be a comedy, but was not funny at all. The lovestory part is nothing new and terribly borring. Just a waste of time in general to watch this. I can't see why people would rate it over 2 stars!!!!"
1,Sandra and Hugh Just Were Not On Target,"TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)"
2,Hugh Grant looks good again and it is soooo funny!,"I think this film was hillarious. I liked it when Sandra got stuck on Hugh's belt, When they were trying out the bed and when sandra walks in on them playing strip cheast. I though it was soooo sad when they were in the hellicopter and i was just like tell each other how you feel. But it is just like most of the other romantic films...Hugh Grant looks very nice again and Sandra was very pretty in her dress.So over all good movie, but it could have been more original."
1,Great movie - badly produced DVD disk,"Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version."
1,Bullock boring. Even Hugh Grant can't save this movie.,"Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie."
2,What the critics find lacking I find fun escapism,"Okay, so you knew how the story would end at the beginning, but isn't that true of all romantic comedies? If you like the genre, you accept that the storyline is predictable but that seems to be what the ""artistic"" movie critics abhor. I enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed Sandra's quirky antics and Hugh's self-centered blindness. But I also enjoyed ""French Kiss"" and ""Kate and Leopold."" Is this the absolute best romantic comedy out there? No. But does it provide 70-80 minutes of escapism? Yes."
2,A must see,This is such a good movie I can't believe it is not for sale! I have to agree with the other viewers that it took me back a few years but boy did it make me feel good. They should definetly release this again! My husband got tired of paying for rentals for this movie so he found it for me on an Internet auction site. Everytime I say that I want to watch it he says oh that again but I think he secretly likes it just as much as I do. After seeing this movie it is no wonder why Julia is such a big star.
1,BORING,"This film was just stupid. Several friends work in a pizza parlor together, and their lives go in different directions. Julia Roberts in one of her earliest roles, and MY MY MY has she changed. She played a loose, temperamental ""town ..."" who gets involved with a rich guy and has to figure out how to play on his turf (preparation for Pretty Woman, maybe?), Lili Taylor plays a girl who is soon going to marry her long-time boyfriend. She has doubts, but in the end does marry him. Another character (Annabeth Gish, I think) is saving money to go to Harvard (or some Ivy league school) and finds a job as a nanny. The man who hires her is married, his wife is in England or somewhere, and they have an affair. And when the wife arrives, he tries to pretend nothing ever happened. Nothing new about that story. The film tries to show the womens' enduring friendship, but it is all... dull and contrived."
1,"No Freddie, no good.","It is unimaginable to think of a Basie album without Freddie Green, not to mention several tunes with electric bass guitar. This, along with Basie with strings, are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums. Don't bother with this one. Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it."
2,Excellent product for thirsty pets,"I have used this product for several months without any major issues. I would recommend this waterer to any potential buyers. It is sturdy and easy to clean. There is a gurgling noise when the water needs to replenish in the bowl. At first, the sound startled my pets but they are all accustomed to the noise. They adapted from a bowl to the waterer rather quickly. I have three of these waterers in my home. They are shared by three cats and three dogs."
1,Poor quality bottle,"Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year. Oh, yeah, you can't buy a replacement bottle, you have to buy a whole new unit!"
1,Depicted wrong,Not what I expected. Has the big hole instead of the small hole for the water to come out. With this a lot of dirt and junk gets back into the water jug.
1,FILLING/PLACMENT DIFFICULTIES....,"These pet ""silos"" are a wonderful invention to keep the ""Baby's"" bowlsfilled and to keep the owner from bending over sooo frequently!!!HOWEVER-the Petmate Le Bristo, besides being a bit ""pricey""is rather difficult to fill-or- rather difficult to place on the floor once filled.Since the product ""bottle"" dosent actually lock securely to the base, once you have filled it with food (or worse) with water, you flip it right side up.Then, you bend to place it on the floor & POW!!-it slips apart and all the cereal (or water) is spilled everywhere!!!The actual owners of this product know what I'm describing!!So once this unit is filled & placed in ""Baby's"" feeding area-all is well-BUT if you spill, you will be vacuuming or mopping for an hour!!!"
1,No lid like in the photo!,"The photo is deceiving. This arrived without a lid, so you have to tip it over to fill, and try and fit it in the bottom without spilling the water all over. I think they are using a photo of the FEEDER, which does have a lid. This is a big difference.The feeder is great, but I will probably return the waterer, it's too hard to fill."
1,Never Again!,"If I could rate this lower than one star, I would! I received a petmate le bistro feeder some months ago. I couldn't use it immediately because of a medical condition of one of my cats. A month ago I took it out of the box, programmed it and was very satisfied for about two and a half weeks. Then it stopped working. I put in new batteries (even though the ones in it should have still been good). I tried to reprogram it and it does not work. I went on the internet to find an e-mail address for Petmate Le Bistro, but there is none. I tried to call the 800 number that is listed. I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I lost patience. It is good for nothing and I will junk it. I am certainly not going to wait even another 5 minutes for that company to answer the phone. Thank you for letting me review this very expensive product that certainly does not work from a company that couldn't care less."
2,keeps fresh water for all 3of my dogs,I have 2 of these and love them .. except when the puppy plays in the bowl! .
2,works great but,"the tank works great and stays cleaner than others I have had in the past but someone should have engineered some kind of handle into it. I have spilled a lot of water on the floor getting the tank back on top. Still I would recommend this dog water dish, and it can be a bit funny to watch the dogs get used to the bubbling of the water tank."
1,No home should be without a Regis Philbin.,"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!"
2,"Hot Stuff, Ridiculous Price","The lives of the dysfunctional Fisher family, their friends and co-workers, makes for a highly entertaining black comedy.I have the first two seasons on tape, which is good, because the price for the first season DVD is beyond ridiculous for 13 eps and the paltry few extras that HBO has deigned to give us.The four-star rating is solely for the quality of the series - *not* the package itself...."
1,DVD release not on BluRay,"This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season 1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???"
1,Meh,"Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there."
2,Kingdoms Review -eels-,"A man called e and Abroken toyshop are profoundly astonishing and origanal albums. Following are three more adversly fantastic epics - Beautiful Freak, electro shock blues & daisys for the galixy making up an altogether complete collection. Phase by phase of E's Life is remarkably reflected throught your musical collection of one of the most origanal and alive artists of today."
2,Cute and Quirky But No Turkey,"Jad who? I hear you ask. Well, the lyricist and singer on this quirky collaboration with the Scotchy guitar poppers is an obscure offbeat American musician and visual artist whose approach to painting and music is basically one of child-like innocence. The cute cover art is therefore a good indication of what to expect inside.Sounding like a candy-store Lou Reed, Jad Fair talks-more-than-sings his screwball cartoon lyrics against TFC's excellent musical backing. Just like when we were age 11, Frankenstein and Superman constantly get name checked.Once the mild irritation factor wears off, you realize that it's actually very effective, as on the rocking ""Crush On You,"" where Jad sings: ""Well, if your looking for a love song/ you've come to the right place."" Or the hilarious ""Always In My Heart,"" where he admits, ""I might not be a Beatle/ but I've got needs like a Beatle/ All I need is love."""
2,Switching Stories,This movie was good because it had a lot of nudity and the best parts were when they switched stories from one to another. There was one story where the director was shooting a vampire movie. The other was in his head - he had something else going on involving a murder.
1,They've got their own way.....,"Of ripping fans off. And this is yet another example. (Oh and Duranies, spare me the ""well don't buy it!!"" rant, it's old.)Just like everyone else has said, this is just a repeat ONCE AGAIN of the old DD videos that every fan already has. Sure, the 3 versions of NMOM is cool to have, but not worth the $34.95 MSRP. And what is with that? Erasure is releasing a DVD with 35 videos and another disc of really rare surprises....and the MSRP for that is $19.99!!If this release was priced a lot lower, I can see the justification of the content.But to charge such a high price, and give us the same old retread, I cannot do anything but give this DVD a very low score.Oh, yes, I am a fan that has paid many house payments on top of car payments for this band. 21 years later and 25 concerts later, I am just getting a little fed up of the scheming."
1,Weak DVD,"I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the ""easter egg"" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos ""A View To A Kill"" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal."
2,a must for any fan,This is a great collection of the best videos-- a must-have for any Duran Duran fan. If only they had a DVD version!
2,Truly the Greatest,"While many people criticize this DVD for its ""difficult"" menu options and for its many Easter Eggs, this DVD is truly exceptional. It is a great collection of Duran Duran's very well-made and artistic music videos from across their career. It has basically every major video they've made from their career at that point. The videos look great, and are fun to watch.Many people criticize the menus for being too complicated. Well, they're not. On each disc, three letters are the submenus to watch the videos, while the A on each disc is the album gallery. And the Easter Eggs, while they can be slightly hard to find, are very worth it. From the different versions of songs to the interviews from early on, they are definitely worth including. For an easy guide to find them, read the Wikipedia page on the DVD."
2,I found the 17 mins version of New Moon on Monday!!!,"Bought my copy yesterday at a bargin price about $12.99. I tried to find the hidden alternate versions and then finally found a way. The 17 minutes version of New Moon on Monday is just worth every penny spent. If you can't find them, here is the tips:Try to use the function key ""display"" on your DVD remote. Select the chapters (or sections) by entering ""1"" to ""38"" on disc 1. You'll find all the hidden interview clips and all alternate versions of the video. Alternatively, put the DVD onto your PC's DVD-ROM, and play it on PowerDVD. While playing, use the function of ""jump to"", this can be done by clicking the right button of the mouse, and you can go to any of the 38 chaptors in disc 1. Same approaches can be applied to disc 2.The reason why I rate this set 4 stars is that it fails to include the promo videos, such as My Own Way, Nightboat, which originally included in ""the first 11 videos"". It's just stupid.Greetings from a Duranie in Taiwan!"
2,greatest close but not quite,I really enjoyed getting to see all the old classics from the band. But it seems Capitol forgot some of their other greatest. What about Perfect Day or Lonely in Your Nightmare? Although it was a nice treat to see New Moon on Monday.
2,Science and style,"Why do geese don't get obese? Easy. What's sauce to the goose, is sauce to the gander. World without end. Amen."
2,Sliding Doors,"Sliding Doors [Region 2]I really enjoyed watching this movie. I bought it after borrowing it from the library. Talk about love!! Yes, I would call it a chick flick."
2,twisty!!!,"coming into this movie, i really did not know too much about it. from reading the box, it seemed interesting and after actually seeing it, i was absolutely captivated!!!! the concept was fantastic - i think we have ALL put ourselves in a ""what-if"" type scenario - wondering what would have happened if we would have made a different choice in something that we did, etc or if in getting somewhere 5 minutes earlier or later, if things would have happened differently. i really loved this movie and i don't think it was hyped enough. i am not a big gwenyth fan(not even sure if her name is spelled correctly), but i really liked her in this!!!!!"
2,"If I could give 10 stars, I would!!!","The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it! If you've ever wondered ""what if"", you'll enjoy this movie! I can't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this. It's funny, emotional, romantic, and VERY intelligent! The fact that a woman's life could change course so much after a two second distraction amazes me and really makes me think. If I had to recommend only one movie to own, it would most definitly be ""Sliding Doors."""
2,Gwyneth Paltrow yet again does another excellent job.,"This is a touching drama starring Gwyneth Paltrow as yet another Helen, who catches a train, one time she does and one time she doesn't - so she doesn't know the same person is controlling two lives! Sounds confusing, huh? But this still is a romantic, sad, dramatic film that the whole family can't miss. John Hannah also does an excellent acting job as Helen's new love interest."
2,"A very well made movie, one of my all-time favorites! :)","This movie is thought-enganging and has a nice mix of comedy and drama. You can relate to both of the ""lives"" of Paltrow and hopefully learn a lesson from her tribulations."
1,Mediocre,"An original story idea that was watered down by a lackluster script, bland acting and unlikable characters. Not even Hollywood's golden girl paired with a snappy new hairdo and a bottle of peroxide could add the necessary zest.With the exception of Helen and her female friend, all of the characters were repulsive and had no redeeming qualities. The film portrays John Hannah's character as 'Mr. Right,' even though he's deceived Helen all along by failing to mention a certain something about himself (I won't spoil the ending). Even his explanation doesn't get him off the hook, because he still lied and deceived her.Also, I could understand the use for Paltrow's accent in Shakespeare In Love and Emma, but was it really necessary in this movie?"
1,Battle of the Scrawny Suitors.,"A look at two scenarios for Helen's (Gwyneth Paltrow) life: what would have happened had she made the train, and what would have happened had she taken a cab. Paltrow must have been cursed, because both scenarios involve wimpy, talky, Woody Allen-wannabe suitors. The sleaziest characters, Gerry (John Lynch) and Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn) go about their business awkwardly, without any verve, and pretty much suck most of the life out of this movie. Paltrow even manages to look unappealing in the ""made the train"" scenario, sporting a 'do that makes her head resemble a rectangle."
2,A real feel good film,"Fantastically clever storyline and wonderful characters. Funny and sad, I'd watch it over and over again!!"
1,free list should be free,"I don't really like it when they put ebooks that cost money on the list that states free! I don't care how good the book is or isn't, free list should be free. It is very maddening when we get caught paying for a book that should not have been on the free list to start with."
2,Good performer,"This item worked well for the first run. It is reconditioned item but it is well worth a try. The carpet dried quicker than I thought. The water took buckets of dirty particles out of my carpet and now it is very nice. Simply, happiness. I didn't go for less than $100 retail model because it wasn't flexible. #1, you can add a hose with this model. #2, amp is 7.2. More amp is better suction power. Anyway, I saved some money on this. I hope it lasts for a while."
1,A questionable cast spoiling a not-quite-there-yet score.,"I very much enjoyed the American version of Sunset Blvd., but the original London version doesn't do much for me. It contains the original (and no longer current) versions of many of the songs, leaving the material with a ""score"" lacking the polish it received when it arrived in America. There are, however, subtle but tantalizing hints of what the show would eventually become. But it is the cast that is the reason to not buy this 2-disc set. Unless you want to hear Kevin Anderson trying to act and sing at the same time, Daniel Benzali sing a role in the wrong range, and Patti LuPone miscast more than just any other actress in musical theatre history, skip it and buy the far superior Glenn Close/Alan Campbell version instead."
1,Weird Movie,"This movie certainly has great actors in it, and they did a good performance, but I didn't really care for the story. I would not recommend this movie too highly. I would be interested to read the story it came from.Agnes of God"
1,Not Vintage MacLean,"This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels. I understand that he passed away prior to this book being published and that is was compiled posthumously. While admittedly not all of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the others. Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it. I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and no one ever seems to duplicate the originals. If you are going to give a couple of MacLean novels a try, go for ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Puppet on a Chain"", ""Bear Island"", & ""Ice Station Zebra""."
1,Disappointing,"I read ""On Beauty"" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for ""White Teeth."" However, I was disappointed to find ""On Beauty"" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's ""willing suspension of disbelief."""
1,No more books about writers.,"I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me."
1,Disappointed,"After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential."
1,Pointless and disappointing,"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them."
2,Wow,Once I started this book I could not put it down. There was no mercy on this family. What a page turner!
2,Strong Characters in On Beauty,"Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty. I read White Teeth right before Beauty to get a grasp of the writer. In my opinion, Smith is much more focused on character development-where as the plot can sometimes become slow or irrelevant. She takes her time to develop each character with their flaws and curious qualities. I guess that it why it took me so long to understand or even care when Howard was discussed as a character. However, take the time to keep reading and you will see how he develops along with his family and colleaguesEven though the book can be ""adjective heavy"" with the plot, I still found it enjoyable and related to my college experiences with all types of students. Read On Beauty for what Smith does best---become invested with the characters."
1,Huge disappointment,"Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited. However, I thought this book did not deserve any of the accolades heaped upon it. Her metaphors are way over used, and some of them just made no sense. Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn't know what she meant then either. Physical descriptions of characters left me picturing that everyone was one of Van Gogh's Potato Eaters, and I couldn't see why, in this book focused on love and relationships, anyone was with anyone for anything. It is said that writers should write about what they know. Based on her descriptions of anything American, I was surprised to learn that she had been in the country even once. She needed more research and a better editor. What's weird though is that I could see she was talented. But after this there is no way I want to try White Teeth. I don't trust her to not make me mad with these elements again."
1,Disapointing read,"I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel"
1,Disappointing,"I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum, snarky and repetitive. This author does not have much to say. I would recommend at least getting them from the library before you waste any money."
1,not even snoop could save this one,bad movie terrible visual effects low budget filming just horrible i hate i even purchased it
1,The movie is not as good as it should have been,"The movie sucked. Snoop, your a bad ass but yo, I don't know what you were thinking when you did this movie."
1,Made Because of Snoop Dog's Indiscretion with an Aardvark,"One insightful reviewer wrote Snoop Dogg was forced into being in this travesty because someone had a picture of him and an aardvark doing what only should be done with one's spouse. That reviewer may well be on point. Either that or Snoop Dogg was seduced with that funny plant sometimes called Mary Jane. Also, what is up with the lighting for this story? The movie appears to have been recorded on film made in 1917. Bright lights obscure faces, and color is as rarely seen as is any semblance of acting. Maybe an out-dated film stock was deliberately purchased to save money. I wish everyone involved in this abysmal attempt at movie making had saved their time and effort. It would have saved me from regurgitating my dinner while being visually assaulted by it."
1,Don't bother!,"This must be the most god awful movie on the PLANET! If I was alowed to give this film ZERO stars I would, but Amazon won't let me!This film is so bad, I can hardly believe this would be sold by anyone anywhere! Don't waste your time or your money! HORRID."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Albert Pyun,Please don't direct another movie.My 8 year old nephew could have done better with a camcorder."
1,A Disappointment,"I have read almost all of Mitchner's books and I have enjoyed all of them until this one. It is bland, overly predictable. It also seems like whoever wrote it (I would be willing to bet that some ghostwriter did or maybe James Mitchner JUNIOR to collect just one last big royalty before the old guy died) Which would be very ironic since the book spends lot of time on GREEDY children. The book is just one long SOAPBOX for someone to attack 1) greedy lawyers causing doctors to fear doing their jobs because of bogus lawsuits 2) greedy dentists in Florida who rip off old patients 3) poor blacks who no matter how hard they try will never get a fair chance; 4) lack of free healthcare for AIDS patients and 5) evil religious people who believe in the right to life..................... Gets old really fast."
2,Grocery bag size,This basket is big enough to fit one grocery bag or one Westie dog when her short legs get too tired. This basket makes my bike more functional. I'd recommend it to anyone.
2,sturdy basket,I wanted a sturdy basket that I could hold my bag and other items. This works perfectly. It was easier to put on then the directions made it seem. The directions where more complicated then needed.
2,Good,A hard to find item but worked well on my 18 speed womens bike. Good for the price. Installed easily
1,Problem with charging - SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW,Bought this otherwise fantastic product. Could not charge it ater a few weeks of use. Then got another one and could not charge it after a few weeks of use. Then they sent another one 3 days ago and it has just stopped charging.And when I call the customer service they told me that it was the FIRST time they heard someone having a charging problem with Plantronics 590a. Somehow I am having a hard time believing them. I feel they are getting dozens of calls each day.Any other readers - if you are having a similar experience - pl post your charging woes.Sad that this is an otherwise good product. But unusuable due to this problem. I recommend prospective buyers to hold off until these design flaws or fixed. Or a competitor beats them to it.
2,Nice Item,"I purchased this headset and have had it for a few days now. Overall, in stereo mode the sound quality is very nice, and the range is wonderful. I can almost walk everywhere in my house and get audio on the adapter that came with the system. If your looking for a wireless headset to use for voice communications, such as Ventilo or Teamspeak, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this one. The built in voice functionality is sub-par for VoIP communications, but excellent for phone communications. It's still an excellent headset, and wireless is a god sent, but I am still using a wired mic for best quality of sound. If you have extensive knowledge of bluetooth, I believe there is a way you can rewrite the stacks to get CD quality sound in voice communications mode. However, I use a Logitech DiNovo bluetooth desktop and it causes extensive lag in communications mode when hooked upto my existing bluetooth adapter."
2,battery life,"these head phones are great for truck drivers, the battery life is on ly about 8 hours other than that there perfect"
2,Exactly what it supposed to do.,"I've had my headset for almost a year now.I got it for the same price as you can get it today.....here(less than $120).I use them mainly for skateboarding, so they get put through the ringer. A fall from 12 stairs is not a good example of ""careful handling"", neither is the rather large quantities of sweat that they have to endure.I use them with my A2DP smartphone.I have used them with the adapter and my ipod, and I have used them wired on airplanes.The sound quality is good.The range is good.I don't have any cracks in the plastic.I don't have any charging issues, nor do I have battery life issues.My only complaints about this product are some design features.I don't like the left-right volume controls, they should be up and down.I also don't like the very large and conspicuous blue flashing light on the side. I look like a fricken moron. These headphones are supposed to make me look cool like James Bond.Minor complaints for a near perfect product."
2,Spactacular Performances! A 'Must See' film!,Sexy! Dangerous! Thrilling! This film has it all. You too will recommend this film to everyone you know.
2,great show....filmed well and lindsey is a true artist!,"Even though he was once one of the great ""pop stars"" in the world...Lindsey Buckingham is an artist. He creates songs from his heart...he plays guitar in a unique and beautiful way and really truly is like no other. Spending an hour and a half with him in concert is inspiring and fun...and speaking of fun, Lindsey can be so personal and heavy in his art its great when he just plays dumb/fun rock and ""Holiday Road"" which was his theme for National Lampoons ""Vacation"" gets a real workout at this show!"
1,"Again, not what you are looking for","Like several other discs available, allegedly of the Drifters Greatest Hits, these are not originals.Save your money. Keep looking for the originals. (I found them in ""The Drifters' Golden Hits"")."
1,NOT 3D CARBON FIBER,OPENED THE BOX AND IT WAS NOT CARBON FIBER!!! IT WAS CLEAR!!! AMAZON NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR INVENTORY ON THIS!update*** 19-NOV-2010Amazon's replacement was still the same. it's not 3d carbon fiber. will return for a refund!!!
2,The best directory for the professional and amateur,"This book is definately a must for anyone studying or wants to know more about essential oils. I used this book as a bible during my Diploma of Aromatherapy course, and I still find it a valuable tool for this modality, as it covers everything from where the plant originates from, its chemical properities, effects on the mind, body, skin, blending. I highly recommend this book for any aromatherapy enthusiast. A must on the bookshelf."
2,Simplistic,"Dieting for Dummies is a simplistic look at diets. Just skimming through the book you can get an idea of how to get on a diet, by cutting calories and all. The book is set up in an easy to read fashion (like other Dummy books) A good overview of dieting."
1,MOTOROLA Bluetooth Headset H500,"I purchased this headset Friday 12/2/2005 from the Alltell office. I used it for the first time on Monday 12/12/2005.Pros: Excellent headset speaker. Best I've ever heard.All features work great!!Cons: Extream back ground noise. Very poor sound quality to the person on the other end. If you drive a Tractor-Trailer truck as I do, forget this headset.DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!"
2,Good but Not Really Funny,"With everyone else raving about how funny this book was I bought it. I was not disappointed with the story, but it really wasn't all that humorous. Dave Barry has a much better feel for humor, especially in Florida. Still, I will read other Hiassen books. I will simply change my expectations to drama rather than humor. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5; false advertising."
2,More fun than a roller coaster!,"[...] I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's brand of humor. Like all of his books, Stormy Weather is satire at its best. It is dark at points, outrageous at others, and over-the-top. It is pure fun; more fun than my first roller coaster ride!Mr. Hiaasen has an active imagination which allows him to create delightfully memorable characters. He is consistent in this regard in all of his books. I haven't read one that has disappointed me yet and I have read at least six of them. There's no need for me to get into the plot. The story tells itself in an engaging way.In this troubled world we live in, it is nice to have an escape. This book did it for me. I trust it will do the same for you.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of ""The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"""
2,A poke in the eye,I always enjoy Hiaasen. His use of irony and knife edged dialogue are a poke in the eye of those abusing our environment.
2,A great romp,"A breezy read. Similar in tone to Elmore Leonard (one of my favorite ""beach read"" authors). Trippy, unpredictable plot, except that you know the bad guys are going to get it in the end. The question is: How?"
2,Still as cheesy and fun as ever,"I loved this show when I was a little girl, and rediscovering the series on Netflix and later episodes on DVD has been a hoot. What surprises me is how much my alliances have changed over the past 40 years. Now I'm totally rooting for the forces against Barnabas. He's such a jerk! What did I ever see in him? The story of my life. :)"
1,NOT ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!??,"just checked out darkshadowsdvd.com, to find this set is August and September 1967 ONLY!!! set 2, was June and July 1967, ONLY!....WHAT A JIP!!! And these sets are going to be released Quarterly, with only (2) months of shows!!!....Why not just release ALL episodes AT ONCE!!! UGHHHHHHHHHH!!! I'm thinking about CANCELLING my pre-order of collection 3. Dan Curtis is a JIP-Master!!!"
2,Let It Be Fantastic,"Let It Be was a great album to be The Beatles' last. The songs somewhat show that it is the end. My favorite song is ""The Long And Winding Road"". The music touches your heart and sends you a message. This is one of their best works. I, like most people, wish that The Beatles never broke up. Their music is fantastic and this album shows it."
2,THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ALBUM,"Let It Be has gotten so much stick over the last 30 years and why? Because it's not as good as Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road? Well not much is but this gives them a run for their money. McCartney is at his peak on this album with three of his best songs, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road and the outstanding rocker Get Back while Lennon adds the very good Across The Universe. Yes, most of the songs have been overproduced by Phil Spector but the music still shines. I'm taking off a mark because of this and also due to the fact that the album is too short but I'm telling you if your a fan of The Beatles, get this album, you won't be sorry."
1,"THE SAD :( ""LET IT BE""","What goes up must come down.... It happened to Elvis, Michael Jackson, and the list goes on and on!even the Beatles in 1969 came tumbling down! This CD proves it.. worn out mad Beatles. Please give credit to Paul and Ringo however for putting out ""Let It Be"" Naked ...which did save this period for The Beatles."
1,Let It Be,"I never recieved this DVD.......I emailed the seller and all he wanted was my zip code,which I sent to him....I have emailed him three times but never recieved my purchuse. I am on a fixed income and wanted it to give as a gift..I am very disappointed.....Lois Eddy"
2,Good....,"This is a solid album. Not the best Beatles album, but it is still enjoyable. Highlights include Two of Us, I've Got a Feeling, and Let it BE."
2,"Remastered audio, yes - mini-doc, no","While I think the remastered audio sounds top-notch, I was disappointed in the mini-documentary and was glad that I didn't get the stereo box for the DVD, because these docs aren't really much. With Let It Be, I was expecting to hear the bitchy stories that we all know and love. I think the harshest thing said in this doc was that Twickenham was too cold and that Apple made for a nicer atmosphere. Then there was a comment from Paul about the Spector mix, but it didn't get any further than mentioning Glyn Johns' mix wasn't up to par and that Spector was brought in. Just enjoy the album, as it is very enjoyable, but don't expect much from the mini-doc, or from any of the mini-docs, for that matter."
2,Roy Ayers Masterpeice,"This is without question Roy Ayers finest album. The cuts Mystic Voyage, and The Black Five, showcase Roy as master vibist. While the wonderful Life is Just a Moment, and Take All the Time You Need, showcase the prodgious vocal talents of Chicas, the best of the many fine female vocalists Ayers has used over the years (Carla Vaughn, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Sylvia Cox etc). Ayers was at his peak at this time. His follow-up Everybody Loves the Sunshine, was just about as good."
2,Gardening made easier,"This little hoe is perfect for the small garden. It's handy, effective and easy to use in tight places. I've had the full sized hula-ho since they were invented and still prefer it over other styles, but now I have added a small raised vegetable garden and have taken up the 'square foot gardening' method, which packs plants into small squares and makes garden maintenance a much simpler process. This small hand-tool sized hula-ho is perfect for weeding and turning the soil before replanting in this limited space. In fact, this and a trowel are the only tools I need for maintenance throughout the season. This is a great little tool.Square Foot Gardening: A New Way to Garden in Less Space with Less Work"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This movie is absolutely terrible! I had to ask myself if this is the downfall of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why a respected actor, such as Morgan Freeman, would take on such a script. This want to be ""aliens"" movie leaves much distaste with it's gorry scences and lack of script. Save your time and money!This movie starts out with a lot of potential. After the first alien comes out of the persons butt, with LOTS of blood, I was ready to turn my head and read a book, which I should've done. Graphic scene after graphic scene is what this movie is about. Unless you are into blood and evil creatures, do not buy this movie!!!!"
1,Rotten Movie,"If you're smart, you won't even waste your time on this one. Not only is the movie cliche, it really doesn't make much sense. I never did figure out what the mute boy had to do with anything in the film. I am surprised Morgan Freeman even took part in this horrible movie."
1,Dreamcatcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003)-Sci-fi's first ugly look behind the bathroom door!,"Dream Catcher (Widescreen Edition) (2003) could have been a good sci-fi experience for me but our first glimpse behind the bathroom door was just too unsightly, even for a die hard Steven King fan like me. As such, I can not rate this film at higher than 2 stars. If this visually explicit scene could have been eliminated I am sure I would have liked this film and rated it at least 3 to 4 stars.It was enough to demonstrate that the creature gestated in the digestive tract of its host by the difficulty the victim had with eating and the resulting rude noises. The audience didn't need the very explicit lesson in Digestive Diseases. That scene aside, there was much I liked about the remainder of this movie. Pardon me for my sensibilities. I am still a Steven King fan but feel he should have stopped short at the Bathroom door since crossing that ugly threshold added nothing essential to the film."
1,"Dreadful. I'll never recover those 2 precious, wasted hours","This is perhaps the worst big-budget horror film I've ever seen.I'm just surprised these guys didn't realize what a horrible turkey they had on their hands and sent it straight to video. At least then they could salve their pride. This movie is crude, It's got enormous, ridiculous plot holes. It's basically unwatchable for anyone who hasn't read the book.My sense is that this is a monster movie masquerading as science fiction, but it's just not smart enough to be convincing in either genre. The script is just too thin, and disjointed, despite being amazingly long.Lawrence Kasdan is the writer for 'The Empire Strikes Back and is a legendary talent - I'm sure this project was sold on his famous name, so this is a professional tragedy of sorts. Hopefully this isn't his last work."
1,"Nothing special here, move along","Many things in the movie do not connect. A lot of things in the beginning have absolutely nothing to do with the outcome at the end. If you're going to place events in a movie, then place them there for a reason!The story is done in a way that tries to make the movie special, but it turns out to be just another ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" type of movie. This is good to watch one time, but after that you won't want to watch it over and over again. Spend your money on something else."
1,Disappointing,"This movie could have been so much better. It started out fairly well but just didn't hold together after the initial introduction. The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene. You've got a monster trapped in the toilet, but that toothpick on the floor is out of your reach, and you need it so badly that you let the monster out to get it? You have to ask yourself, ""What's WRONG with this person?""Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie was also a big disappointment. He's such a talented actor, but here he seems to be just going through the motions. His character just falls flat. And as noted in an earlier review, the hair and eyebrows make him look silly and cartoonish.No big surprises in the final battle sequence. You pretty much know by this point who the two sides are going to be. But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that? I just wanted to shout at the television, ""What? NO! That CAN'T be the end!"" What a let-down."
1,Very disappointing,"I love horror films and tend to be extremely forgiving of even the worst schlock, but Dreamcatcher is truly a disappointment. Upon first viewing there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed, but the more I thought about it... the less any of it made sense. The plot is convoluted, the characters are wasted, and the alien fungus-monsters seem to have the psychic ability to create massive plot holes wherever they roam.Stephen King cannabalized half a dozen of his previous works to produce this self-plagiarism, and the movie adaptation is even worse. I have seen (and own) some of the worst movies ever made, and I enjoy them greatly -- but Dreamcatcher does not merit a second viewing... or a first, for that matter."
1,"Tosh, but it has its moments","This movie really isn't sure what it wants to be. Part Independence Day, part X-Men, and part Alien, it even makes references in passing to another Stephen King story, Stand By Me.Essentially the film can be divided into two halves -- the enigmatic first half where four thirtysomethings make moderate use of their ESP capabilities on their way through their professional lives, one flashback to 20-years-ago, towards a mid-winter cabin destination. In the second half, we get the ridiculous Alien/Independence Day sub-plot, with Morgan Freeman being forced to swear (frequently) in order to convince us that he's not the same endearing character from Se7en and the Shawshank Redemption.In the end, the Earth is saved -- my apologies if that ruins it for anyone -- but this dog's dinner should retain your attention for about an hour. Once the aliens turn up and start visiting people's bottoms, don't feel embarrassed about reaching for the fast-forward button."
2,Have any of you reviewers' read the book?,"As with most Stephen King movie adaptions, it would make the movie better if the book is read.This book was very good (Between 4-4.5 stars) in my opinion.There was a lot to the book which, from how the reviewers are complaining, was probably left out due to the time constraints of ""run time.""I can understand how the movie probably is hard to understand if you didn't read the book.Next time, if the movie is an adaption from a book, read the book before you write a review.Too keep the ratings for the movie fair, I am giving the movie 5 stars even though I didn't see it, just like the other reviewers are giving the movie a low rating without reading the book. My rating is high because the book was good."
1,what in the h*ll??????,"Is this movie about and what I did not understand was what aliens had to do with indian dreamcatchers??? The movie starts out well but about 45 minutes into it loses its focus and plot and everything else.......My fiance and I could not even finish the movie, King should have focused more on a different plot line without aliens, and been more involved with the childhood friends and their little ""odd"" friend. The past scenes with them as kids was the only really entertaining thing about this movie and I wish there had been more like the story in the movie with the evil clown (cant remember the name).This movie was awful."
1,"Recipe for disaster...er, Dreamcatcher","Stand By Me, Men in Black, Independence Day, Outbreak, What Dreams May Come, the segment of Creepshow with fast-reproducing alien fungus, any Toxic Avenger movie, Deliverance, Forrest Gump.Frappe' 'em all together in a blender and strain away most of the entertainment value and plot line conclusions. Add a dash of poor acting and cheesey, unconvincing dialogue. Garnish with special effects.Voila, you've created Dreamcatcher. Watch and TRY to enjoy, though it's doubtful you will."
1,It sucks and it's boring.,"At first, the movie seems pretty good and shows some potential. But then it slows down...way down...and then picks up a little bit with some ass-aliens, then mashes in some kind of crazy-general alien hunter side plot and also explores what it might be like inside the memory banks of a person. The movie is just so slow and so boring that I practically fell asleep watching it. The ending, which I won't spoil, had me laughing out loud (the best part of the movie for the wrong reason). I thought, ""Hey, what if that retard was..."" and then it happened. A classically bad horror ending at it's worst."
1,They really DUD IT!!!,"The script is worth $1, a little more than the other Stephen King novels-turned-to-movies.What does the dreamcatcher have to do with anything in the movie?"
2,Well done movie about an intriguing historical theme...,"This movie is a superb historical attempt to portray the Madness of King George III of England. It takes place shortly after the American Revolution, and combines a couple incidents in King George's life into a condensed time period. Although not 100% historically accurate, it is superbly done. Great acting, cast and sets. Nice movie for those interested in the time period or historically themed movies."
2,It's a great WMI book for VBscripting admins,"The authors do a good job of showing lots of WMI VBscript code examples, and they weave it together with good explanatory prose. Using this book, along with the WMI SDK docs and samples from Microsoft gave me enough info to do some usefull stuff with WMI."
1,"Absurd movie -- must have been ""rent-due"" day in L.A.","Disgusting scenes of excess violence toward women and fake orgasms all around make this ridiculous farce seem like a soft-core version of every Porn King's first feature film. As a further insult, the viewer is subjected to tortuous ""analysis"" via a Rogerian psychiatrist. The featured ""actor"" looks like a janitor in a West Virginia high school; Rosanna Arquette and Alexandra Paul, who cannot be made to look ugly, nevertheless turn in performances that are spoofs of every bad acting class. These people must have desperately needed the money. If they acted for royalties, then their earnings will be about right. Zero."
2,"Really loved it, discussion about feelings, excellent",I really enjoy all the mercer Mayer books and this one I used for a kindergarten activity. I made up magnetic pieces and discussed with the children about feelings. Excellent book.
2,This Books Haunts Me,"I was 12 years old when I read this book (I'm now 46). My understanding and impressions of the fall of Troy and all the rich cannon of literature that surround it will be forever seen through the eyes of Helios and the other living characters in this story. No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development, not just in this book, but in many of his other stories as well (Don Quixote USA!). Its sad that its no longer in print, but if you are lucky enough to find a copy, you will enjoy fictional writing at the top of its form."
2,greatest,"this cd was sent promptly and it is a great cd, love to listen to the songs on this cd, i have purchased all of John McCutheon's cds"
2,Top line,As a custom woodworker I have a love for tools that do the job I need done. The is the greatest little saw on the market. The only draw back is trying to find someone that sells it without going on line.
1,"Slippery handle, blade dulls quickly","When I got the saw, I thought: is this really the thing that everyone's been raving about? The blade looked good, but the handle is cheap plastic, and it's slippery. It's easy to lose your grip on the pull stroke, and, worse, it's possible for your fingers to slide forward onto the blade on the push stroke. Plus, the saw is starting to feel dull after fewer than 10 cuts - and I mean small cuts, mostly through pine.Note: The red dot on the handle let me to expect that the blade could fold into the handle, like a pocket knife. That seemed like a handy way to protect the blade so I could keep the saw in a toolbox. But no, the blade does not fold. That's my mistake, so it's not part of the reason for my two-star rating, but I figured I'd mention it in case someone else out there had also assumed that the blade could fold."
2,It did the job.,"I had a drawer that fell everytime you pulled it out - very irritating. I purchased a drawer rail at home depot, and it was a left side rail which did not work. I purchased this through Amazon to avoid the hassle of looking at the store. Now my drawer works great. No complaints."
2,Great Western,"Cast is great - good to see an early Heston in a Western role. A little long, but very enjoyable."
1,My favorite scene,"When the ""Major"" wants to rescue Jean Simmons and make war on the Hennesy's. ""Leech"" (Heston) says I can't back you on this Major and all the hands agree. When the Major starts to ride in alone, Leech jumps on his horse and catches up and gets as close as he can to support his boss. Then around the hills comes all the other hands. Heston's expression is priceless."

1,Not what advertised,"These are complete crap. They are not the beef tendons they used to be, or that shown in the picture on amazon. What I received is some kind of dried out, pressed flat, jerky like wafers. Also the label in the picture on amazon says ""100 percent natural"" but the label on the package I received says ""premium quality"". What I received is junk that I'm afraid to even feed my dog."
2,Excellent Treat!,"I got these as a treat for my beagle, Barclay. He absolutely loves them, and they keep him occupied for hours. It's a great all natural treat, I have already bought more!"
1,AAHHH!!! (as in suprise and/or alarm),"me and my fellow cohorts thought we'd find a new way to torture ourselves via the medium of motion picture, or ""talkies"" as i perfer to call them. i started it all with ""head"" starring the monkeys, and thought it best i end the torture 3 or so weeks later, after such masterpieces as ""battlefield earth"", ""kazaam"", and ""santa with muscles"", by renting ""da hip hop witch""(check the reviews on that, and i think his grudge against me is still in effect). but the pain was far from over after we found this ""doozy"".why was this movie even made? here's all i have to say about the movie.1-Gene Siskel called it one of the worst movies of the year... and then died later that year(possibly from the movie, we can't be sure...more tests)2-maximum of 1,000 words, hrmm, i could have done it in two: Diaper Gravy."
1,More of a car accident than a movie,"Both can result in Post Tramadic Stress Syndrom and both make you not want to repeat the experience. The actors are bad(and trust me I have seen many ""bad movies)the plot is invisable(there isn't one) and my time was wasted. I realize that this is a kid's movie for a specific audience but happened to making a movie enjoyable for adults? Or kids over 5 for that matterOverall-I know you are not thinking about wasting your time with this movie but just in case you've blown a circut and feel compleaded to rent do not bother."
1,I must protest with all that I have......,"Either Johnny8Ball is at the height of his sarcastic powers or he has contributed the single worst review ever to appear on Amazon.com. Not only is the movie he selected one of the most incompetent and offensive ever made, it is perverse, dull, slapdash, and horribly unfunny. The alleged ""humor"" never hits (NOT ONCE!) and the performances by the ""legendary cast"" range from embarrassing to downright shameful. Hopefully, potential viewers will avoid the obviously jaded rambling of Mr. Eight Ball and stay far, far away from a film that would not appeal to anyone, adults or children."
2,"Excellent, kids fight over this!",This bike was a huge hit for us. Purchased for our son's first birthday an he still tries to ride it at 4! All the kids want to ride it down the hills in our yard and driveway. I even backed into it with my car and we unbent one wheel and it's still fine! We won't be able to pass it on to little brother but may buy him his own...
1,Disappointing - feet hit rear wheels,"My mother purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. At the time she was 15 months old. She was just tall enough for the lowest setting on the seat. She quickly learned to climb on and off and go forwards and backwards and loved her bike. The steering was a little stiff and took a while for her to get the hang of it.As spring came we moved outdoors and she got better at steering. She grew so I moved the seat to the second setting. Now, at 18-20 months, the bike isn't so great -- when she tries to go forward, the back of her feet hit those rear wheels - every time! I've tried every height setting on the seat and it doesn't make a difference. She always wants to ride her bike, but gives up after just a few feet - who would want their feet to get hit all the time! The rear wheels are just a few inches too close to the seat.We will be looking for a replacement. Disappointing."
1,Defective master?,"I was thrilled to see this classic released on DVD, however I've received two copies and both are defective. About 28 minutes in the picture freezes. My first copy disabled my DVD player completely; it wouldn't recognize any command except Power Off. The replacement copy shows very pixilated picture/frames then picks up the action in full again at about minute 36.There's a big disclaimer before the film begins that the original 35mm film is damaged so the picture quality of the DVD is compromised. Does this mean all copies have defects? Are others experiencing this same issue?"
1,"Cheasy, very cheasy","I am a big fan of the classic kung fu movies. However, I found this movie to be extremely cheasy. The One-Armed Boxer, the hero, is from a prior film. This movie fails to offer enough background about the hero, so I found myself rooting for the enemy instead. Additionally, the One-Armed Boxer's missing arm is clearly noticeable tucked within his shirt. It is hard to take him and his fighting scenes serious. Where this film lacks in plot, it makes up for in a multitude of characters and creative fight scenes. You will see where many video games got inspiration for characters and fighting techniques. Instead of this film, I suggest a film with Bruce Lee, the Venom Mob, Gordon Liu, Jackie Chan or the ""Five Fingers of Death""."
1,GREAT MOVIE!...but...,"I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.*IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is."
1,Does quality matter???,"I bought this movie yesterday and it really is a classic! But the quality seems to go to hell throught certain scenes, flickering colors. It even stopped playing about 30 min. in. I don't know what's up but I really feel ripped off. Maybe the double disc version will be better. Highly doubtfull concidering this version was supposedly remastered?"
2,"Old, real old, but still great.","As a fan of the Venoms it's tough to rank this on their level. But this movie in it's own right was great. Classic characters, and a great weapon make this movie worth watching. And what can we say about the Evil Master, he was tight. I only wish he would have ripped off more heads. But when he did, it was great."
2,Master of hte flying gullitine,If your into kungfu movie from the 1970's. This the film for you. A clasic flim. Worth wotching. A must have movie.
1,STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED!~,"I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them. This is the first time I have had a problem with them but this none the less is an issue. Product paid for, not received. Period. Will make a claim with Amazon."
2,Is it fragile,"Anybody worry about breaking this one can go <A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here</A> and read their review. A quote: ""At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering.""..."
1,Waste of money,"1st the ipod is expensive. It should at least come with a protective cover. 2nd i rarely used it and only when im in the gym. Quite to often when i go to turn the ipod on it goes into something called ""disk mode"" which freezes the unit up and cant be played. Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze. Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"iPod Nano's are exceptionally terrible. Do not buy them unless you have a spare $200 to waste. Mine broke in 32 Days, and apple will have nothing to do with the repair. Thanks iPod, for a waste."
2,IPOD NANO,"I bought this iPod Nano for my 14 year old and he loves it, it's so small and sounds so clear, unbelievable."
1,great product...for the time it lasts,"I received an ipod nano 4gb as a gift. It was great other than it got WAY scratched up in about a day of usage. After having it & using it for about 3 weeks, I had it in my pants pocket, when i took my pants off that evening it destroyed the screen. It still worked but the screen was completely damaged. It worked for a good 2 or so months later & then when completely dead. It would be one thing if all these problems came with a cheaper price, but $250 is an insane price to pay for something that will not be sturdy whatsoever & couple possibly give you less than 2 months of usage. I strongly recommend you pass this up & purchase a product that is actually reliable."
2,Protect Your iPod,I got the Nano and ordered an acrylic cover for it from agent18.com. This is the best cover I have seen. It completely protects the nano - especially the screen. Check it out.
2,Fusion of style and functionality,"I love my ipod. It is stylish, easy to use, and serves its purpose well. All in all an awesome music player."
2,no envelopes,"I like this product and it's easy to use. There are many choices of cards and other projects, but no clearly defined envelop template."
2,path-breaking fiction,"Each story reveals bare facts of Victorian life.Devoid of flowery language and overflowing sentimentality that Shelley,Keats,Dickens and others affected.Even compared to today's writers shows great knowledge of sociology,criminology and advances in investigative methods."
2,A wonderful mistery book,"I love it. I'm a fan of Sherlock stories, and I think this is the ultimate edition for others like me. It's hard to not keep reading the next page."
1,"PRINT WAY, WAY TOO SMALL!!","All the stories of Sherlock Holmes are crammed onto 472 pages (without the T of C), each page measuring 10.7"" by 7.5"". My first impression, on opening the book, was that a gray mist had been sprayed on each page. Looking closer, I realized the gray stuff was the text. I will not subject myself to this sort of eye strain, and suggest you don't either.The previous edition was over 1,100 pages. The Amazon preview pages for this volume loaded so slowly I gave up trying to see them, and wasted my money on this illegible copy. Don't buy it, would be my recommendation. Try to find the earlier, green-covered book, with larger print and over twice as many pages."
2,Classic is a classic,"Sherlock is a classic. And here you can go along all hystories about it, knowing in deep what happens in the life of this very rare detective."
1,VERY Small Type Makes Reading Difficult (Impossible?),"The typeface is very small. This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain. These books are the latter.If microscopic print doesn't bother you, these two are a very nice set in a shelf-box. I'd love them - except I can't see them. Too bad, really.Since there is no preview that can inform a potential buyer as to font-size, I felt my review would focus on this, so as to alert those interested."
1,The Author Has An Odd Fascination,"I read this book in law school. The author rejects the whipping post, and instead, recommends administering electric shock to criminals as punishment for crime. What good is that? Shocking someone months after the bad act is committed is not going to create any bad associations or cure any misbehavior."
1,It is for the audience,"""Pleasure is the absence of pain"" was how one philosopher phrased it, I don't remember who it was, as I was looking out the window at a jaybird when my boy, who has a PHD, was talking it up. Now, I don't know how much shocking or flogging or punching jailbirds will stop them doing their plainfaced bad deeds, but it sure will make a lot US out here feel GOOD. WE didn't get put in prison. Tailgating and backstabbing and firing people because you don't like them and all the mean stuff we enjoy doing out here ain't illegal, and we ain't got CAUGHT at the stuff that IS. YET. Put this corporate punishment on TV, where we can all watch it. Who knows if that fellow DID the stuff they say he did, or whether YOU did it and didn't get CAUGHT, but you can GUARANTEE that you'll FEEL GOOD because it's happening to SOMEONE ELSE.That is my two cents.Review by O. J. Haney."
1,C300 4matic does not fit,"This item matches ""what fits your car"", but caused my car to hesitate, like it had too much/little air.I picked up new filters from the dealer yesterday ...and those were actually 1/4"" longer...and this fixed my problem.2009 4matic sport."
2,Fits the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic exactly.,"This is an easy install on the 2004 Mercedes C240 4matic and should be similar on the other w203 chassis cars. Open the hood, pull up and forward on the front engine cover, lift the back engine cover, flip the back engine cover, unbolt the torx bolts, remove the old filters, clean the crud out of the area, insert new filters and reverse procedure to re-install. Been using Mann genuine German filters for decades. Great fit and quality."
1,This movie is bad.,"And embarrassing. It's not a total loss, no because it can be entertaining...but only once in a while. Sure, the kids will probably like it , and even worse, try to imitate it but really, if you're not 6, 7 or younger, I wouldn't waste your time. That's what this was - a BIG waste of time.And it's so over exaggerated...Ugh.Not recommended."
1,3 ninjas,my favorite one is colt.he`s cool.he kiks those bad guys but.so whatever you do dont fight colt
2,Do you want to see Sasha???,"Hi!!!If you would like to see Sasha,go to ebay.She was nice.I liked her clothes.I think Dana is in this collection too.I can`t wait to see her.She looks like the best one in the Genie Magic collection.I soooooo can`t wait for the movie,and I hope the animation is like the Rock Angelz movie.I think it is.By the way,I like Meygan.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
2,Nice conclusion to the series,"After reading the first two stories in this series I was looking forward to this one and wasn't disappointed. Marty while successful in her career has had bad luck in love. Nat with his arrogant background was a great character, how his life changed after his near death experience. I liked how the family intertwined and showed that the Stepp woman while wounded where strong and ended up happy."
2,Love it,"When I purchased this book, I expected it to have the script of the show. Now, I know that it is a nice biography about Cameron Mackintosh. You can learn about his life. I expected a bit more about the concert of Hey, Mr. Producer. I expected a program or something. I enjoy reading it."
1,"Suspend your disbelief, and then suspend it some more...","Start with a good premise.Then fill it with so many holes that you can drive Mack trucks through it...I found that reading this story only had me thinking that for a heroine who was so smart so often, and able to predict life threatening situations with such great ability, she was certainly unable to see how many ways she could have been eliminated so as to make this story a non-starter.Oh, there it is, it dawns on me that if the other characters could see how easily I do that our protagonist could be snuffed out, then the book would have ended. And that is what should have happened. This book should have died in the slush pile."
1,Cliffhanger ending,"I've bought and read all of the books in this series. The story line is pretty good, but the author loves cliffhanger endings. I won't be buying any more in this series."
1,Not brand new as described,"I love time trax, and I love collecting movies, the only problem that I have is when I pay a premium price for an item that is supposed to be brand new, but it turns out to be a dv case full of used and scratched/scuffed discs that have obviously seen their way around the break room or wherever some employee decided to watch it. I only come to that conclusion because the item is not from a private seller. It is suppose to be factory direct via amazon. Very disappointing. I begrudgingly will not send it back as I have been waiting a long time for these to be available and I am sure with all o the problems this item has had it probably won't be around very much longer, if you don't care about condition than go for it."
2,Great Story,"Sinsiter Enough to make Stephen King cringe ! Dan Simmons is top notch story teller , to say the least ....."
1,A poor book,The book is full of little actions and descriptions which don't have much meaning in the story. Looks like they are here for filling the pages.The text would have needed radical cuttings. At one point I even wondered if Simmons had written it himself; but actually it was his first novel.Slow and pointless.
1,Disappointing,"After reading the Hyperion and Iluim novels, I approached Kali with high expectations and was frankly disappointed. Maybe I'm jaded by images of human sacrifice, but reading Kali was like reading the novelization of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" minus the comedy."
1,Dark and depressing,This book started out a little depressing and went completely downhill. Likely I was not in the mood to read about the tragedies which occur in this novel but I did not enjoy this read.
1,Xenophobic garbage,"I kid you not, the *entire premise* of this book is how inscrutable and exotic and creepy Indian people are...what with their bad hygiene, and the weird food they eat, and their yucky poverty, and their bizarro religion with all those freaky goddesses, and oh yeah, human sacrifice...besides, Calcutta is an EVIL city, do you understand?!?! EEEEEEVIL! EEEEEEVIL!!!Characters in this book repeat different variations on that sentence approximately seven thousand times. Maybe if I could buy into that premise - that Calcutta, a city of more than 10 million people, is just EEEEEEEVIL, poisoned by a loathesome and murderous vileness utterly incomprehensible to the rational Western mind - then this book might have scared me. But I don't buy that, because it's stupid xenophobic garbage, and so this book just got on my nerves. I'm sorry you didn't like your vacation in Calcutta, Mr. Simmons. Cripes. Now give it a rest."
2,Literate and Disturbing,"...this is hardly the most frightening book ever written. I wouldn't even put it in the top 10. That said, Mr. Simmons has crafted a chilling read. Right from the introduction, I found myself completely seduced by his fictional Calcutta as a den of unspeakable evil. This has stayed with me after reading the book, and I find that I am now drawn to Calcutta in the same way I was drawn to New England after reading H.P. Lovecraft, just to see if it is really that disturbing.The book is extremely enjoyable to read, with an almost literary quality. The author is deft at handling the demands of exposition within the constraints of the first person narration. A few moments ring untrue, but others (including the climax) are just fantastic. Overall the book has the messy feel of a true-life story, which of course makes it all the more disturbing.Highly recommended!"
2,Drama Like I Used To Be,"Loved the movie, suspense, glamour and melodramatic takes. Hated the little girl (you're supposed to.) Don't shut off the video when it says ""The End."" The best part is during the ending credits."
2,Terrific Performance By A Wonderful Child Star,"Patty McCormack was only a little girl when she appeared in this movie, but she already had plenty of acting experience, having played the same part in the stage version.All of the actors in this wonderful movie do outstanding jobs, but Patty is simply outstanding.The story,as the title suggests, concerns heredity. Does the bad seed of a parent actually pass on and influence his or her child?Aside from Patty's remarkable performance, there are also standout acting jobs done by the wonderful Henry Jones and Eileen Heckart.This is a spellbinding movie, and I never get tired of watching it over and over again."
2,Thank Heaven for Bad Little Girls.,Awesome! Patty McCormack at her best. Everyone I suggest this movie to thinks it is the best movie they ever saw.
2,Great Creepy Movie and Great Shipping,"A really creepy movie and a timeless classic. The story behind the making of the film (originally was a play) is very interesting, too. The movie was shipped out quickly and was in perfect condition. Very happy with the purchase."
1,Didn't work on my kindle fire,This is one of my favorite movies to watch with my mom but unfortunately it was very choppy and did not work well on my kindle fire. Amazon refunded me for my purchase though so that's good!
2,"Good CD, Beautiful one, Perfect time, perfect sound.","As good, as I expected to be. To me it was what I wanted. Good conditions, Good sound, So, perfect!!. That was the CD I was looking for."
2,Simply the best of the Bee Gees,"I've been on a long search for this album and when I finally got it, I can't stop listening. I almost listen two to three times a day to this album, almost more than I listen to my ""Still Waters"" or ""One"" or ""E.S.P"" albums. ""Paying The Price Of Love"", ""Kiss Of Life"", ""Haunted House"", ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Fallen Angel"" are the best. Maurice takes an great lead on ""Omega Man"" and ""Above And Beyond"" and they both rock hard.I would advise any big fan of the Brothers Gibb, to buy this album if you haven't got it yet, because it's really great. Some people say that this is the best album the Bee Gees ever released, that is so true, but ""Still Waters"" I guess are the best."
2,I love this old-fashioned story,"I happened upon this book by accident while cleaning out a garage and I am so glad I did. I had heard of the author years ago but didn't try to read any of her books. I'm glad it was A Lantern In Her Hand that I found.I could not put it down; reading till the wee hours of the dark a.m., about falling asleep with it, only to finish it as soon as I could awaken.I found myself in Abbie Deal's story as a wife, mother, and now grandmother, over and over again. What we give up for and what we do for, our children and husbands goes largely unappreciated, but we would do it all over again just as Abbie would. This story speaks to the heart of every wife, mother, and grandmother. It somehow validates what we have done and why.It is an old-fashioned story and not for you unless you appreciate settling the west in covered wagons on a prairie, living off the land, and learning how to 'make do' with what one has at hand."
1,Bob Hoskins good actor,"Can't believe I'm writing a review for this movie.Out of all the flicks I reviewed this is probably the oddest of them all.Well Mermaids isn't my kind of movie ,but I can say I seen it.Bob Hoskins is a great actor and has been in films such as , Roger Rabbit , Enemy at the Gates and Unleashed w/ Jet Li.Mermaids is too soft for me to ever watch , I guess I'm trying to say it's for younger females."
2,A saw every professional and handyman should have,I came to know this type of saw when I was stationed in Japan. Brought back two and unfortunately they finally had their day. Was glad to find this one. Absolutely great!
2,Spoiler Alert,"I loved this film- from beginning to end I was caught up in the magic. Much has been made about the ending. I speak as someone who has been through rehab ( a car accident 3 years ago left me a quad). They got the emotions right. You don't have to agree with the choice to realize the love these characters have for each other. Being handicapped means you loose many choices, these characters, this story is about the power given to you by love. And wow- this is a movie that shows the power of an extremely well made film."
1,for scam hollywood is constantly pulling off,"a separate price for wide screen/full screen versions?!?!?!?im surprised they dont have a charge for the second disc as well.the movie itself didnt capture my interest.i feel clint is a fine actor and a competent director....but his movies tend to be slow in pace and over rated.again,the 1 star is for the ripoff."
2,It is a boxing movie and you should see it,"Kept hearing how this was not a boxing movie so I rented it to see for myself. It is a boxing movie and a good story woven into it. I felt a kinship with the character Swank plays (both from poor, trashy, southern backgrounds and trying to overcome that and reach a dream). It is difficult to review this movie without giving away the ending. So if you do not want to know more stop reading, it will not give much away but a small bit.........................the portrayal given by both Swank and Eastwood in making the choices that are made in the last few minutes of the movie are top notch and worthy of all praise to them as actors. I pray never to be on either end....Watch this movie!!!!"
1,Dehumanizing.....,"This movie blatantly equates man to the level of an animal (a dog to be specific). Instead of emphasizing the fact that man as a person is important and valuable as a creation of God, man is reduced to the level of animal, without a soul. In the movie Clint Eastwood, despite his CLAIMED Catholic faith, decides to murder the boxer that he trained, in the name of being humane. The very purpose of this movie is appalling."
1,A better idea,"It would have been more believable if Hillary Swank was a model who falls off the runway and cracks her skull.This movie has no story, no character development, no interesting (barely intelligible) dialogue.How this move could beat 'Sideways' for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. Mystic River was much better.Hey movie industry, try putting more effort into quality product and maybe box office returns will improve!"
1,**contains spoilers**,"You know, at the price of movies, it's cheaper to buy the DVD. So I buy the DVD, no problem. But be honest about what I'm getting. I thought I was buying some movie about an against-all-odds underdog woman boxer, not a political statement on euthanasia. And it is so preposterous that Swank's character (This role just reconfirms Swank is a man.) has fought & persisited & trained for all this time & then pow accident decides she will opt for dead in like 15 minutes. If I'm supposed to believe her character up until then, I believe her character would want to prove the doctors wrong & fight to walk & even box again. Please, this sucks. Eastwood, don't veil your statements with a boxing movie. Just retire already. The only thing right about it (& I say this about many movies) is having Morgan Freeman on the cast list."
2,"Multi-Layered, Spare, Beautiful","Million Dollar Baby seems like a simple story on the surface. It is told sparely, without ruffles or flourishes, but like all great art, has layers of meaning and symbolism.On the surface (and what a vivid surface!) there is the boxing, and Maggie's indomitable spirit, which all her life has helped her fight to survive.There are the relationships, laconic but deep, like slow-flowing rivers; the bones on which the surface lies.And at the movie's heart: there is religious significance. The story becomes one of Christ's parables of the Good Samaritan or the Kingdom of Heaven. And there is a Christ figure. But who is the Christ figure and how can that person save others?It is interesting that some conservative groups find this movie offensive. If they consider it anti-family or anti-religious, they are really missing the point."
2,Eastwood on top of his game,Lean and spare filmaking and storytelling. The problem with movies today is the lack of good movies. Here's a great one. A professional production in every sense of the term.
2,One of my FAVORITE movies!,"I own this video and it is one of the best movies in my collections. I've seen it about 50 + times and never get tired of watching certain skating scenes over and over.. not to mention the lovey parts. This is such a sweet movie! Well-written, cute and the actors actually look like their skating. If you enjoy watching Olympic Skating..(and who doesn't) you'll LOVE THIS MOVIE!"
2,the cutting edge: gold medal edition,i love the cutting edge i first seen it when i was eight and i remembered it when i looked into one of my pictures when i was five so i looked it up and bought it. i think everyone should see this movie atleast one and if it turns out to be a favorite you should buy it.
1,"Boring, and a bad influence, considering its PG","The alchohol scene had no place at all in a PG movie. Some underaged friends of mine intentionally mimicked the lemon-drop shooters scene, to a degree that almost lead to the death of one of them. The movie is boring, predictable, and irritating. Both Moira's character and her trainer have got to go.The Redwings had the right idea but rejecting the character, played by DB Sweeney in the movie. We all should have rejected the entire movie."
2,The sweetest of love stories that you'll watch over & over.,"I was so pleased to see the other reviewers felt the way I did about this sappy movie. The chemistry between Kate and Doug is so realistic and the ice skating is excellent. I can watch this movie anytime, again and again and never get sick of it."
2,Better than expected!,"After nearly wearing out my VHS copy, I bought this on DVD. The sharp, crisp viewing was a very nice surprise, given my poor old worn-out VHS copy that I'd grown accustomed to."
2,A Masterpiece of the Jazz Age,"It is tragic that he isn't more celebrated. This is one of the best books I have ever read, because it works on so many levels: it is a wonderful pot-pourri of character portraits, it's a revealing examination of sociological values at work, and it is a marvelous literary work of a million subtle influences in harmony. It is, in short, a reflection of the motion-pictures that made their appearance at the time, and beyond that, is ripe with biblical allusions wonderfully entwined with the storyline. Dos Passos requires the reader to work, and he should be given more credit for making us do so with so much satisfaction."
2,Good movie,This is a good movie. I would suggest you watch it. Good ideas about mental healthcare and it's practices are portrayed on this movie. Jack Nicholson did a great job too.
2,Archetypes,"What a timeless film. As a child you're taught shame and fear. You allow them to be your limiters until one day you wake up, face the worst in yourself and choose freedom. Of course life isn't that straightforward but that's the essence of what I take away from ""Cuckoo's Nest"". Once your authentic self is awakened you can't choose another's definition of yourself anymore though. It's hard not to relate this 1975 movie to Hitler's Germany, or shoot, even things that are happening in 2010.Director Milos Foreman put together an excellent ensemble cast of archetypes with Nurse Rached representing the status quo, McMurphy the rebel, and Chief the voiceless Everyman. All the other patients and warders serve as the Greek Chorus."
2,ONeFlew over the Kuckoo Nest,"As ayoung man, (1967)I worked as an Orderly in a hosp and did work on a Psych ward, many people in our America need this care and attention. They are not ""bugs"" but some little thing can be skewed."
2,"Not as good as I thought,but one of the best.","To say the truth,this wasn't a film that I TOTALLY liked.But,however,this is one of the best film ever made.In this world,there's a lot of people who have mental problems.They must be treated in very good care.Like in a hospital.(For example)In this movie,not only the guys who have mental problems have been more insane,but even a ordinary person gets mad being in this special hospital.Their not educating them,but treating them as an animal.All the human rights are gone in this film.Like the Shawshank Redemption.(Maybe Stephen King thought about this novel after watching this movie...)After you see this film,you'll feel blank.Not because it sux,but this flick will give you a good message.This message,you'll know when you see this flick. And one more thing.The acting was NO.1!!!!"
2,what i think of one flew over the cockoo's nest,well i think that one flew over the cockoo's nest is a great movie that points out the importance of abnormality in todays society
2,Fabulous recording,"This is, from all Händel Concerti Grossi recordings that I know, the most fabulous soul moving experience ever. Just super!"
1,Silly junk,Best actor: the dogBest Actress: wasn't in this movieRunning time with banter of witty friends and cocktails: 114 minutesRunning time home alone: 114 hoursWinner: Worst production values for the yearWinner: Worst copy to DVD - EVER
1,"bad, bad, bad","Where to start..graphics hideous, sound terrible, game play buggy. Avoid unless u can get it for under a buck!!! I think I spent 3.00 for it and am using it for a coaster!"
2,Raffi is a timeless children's classic.,"That's all- Raffi is a timeless children's classic. Easy to sing along to, easy to listen to!"
2,Wonderfully Fun!,"I don't know who loves this disc more, me or my 3 year old! The Baby claps along too! Great songs that make you smile and tap your toes!"
2,Goose vs. Gander,"Glenn Smith has really done it this time. Hell hath no fury like the Bushies who have reveled for weeks in the fiction the swift boat people have dished out, only to now see that Smith and Texans for Truth refuse to roll over and play dead without a fight.It's long been said that fiction uncorrected becomes the truth. Kudos to Mr. Smith for bringing truth back into the discussion!"
1,Shameless Political Nonesense,"No doubt written from the same typewritter CBS used for it's forged memos used in the 60 Minutes show. This is a transparent attempt to steal the amazing popularity of ""Unfit for Command"" a best seller by John O'Niell and Joe Corsi."
1,for some not others,"This book is written by a liberal -and in my opinion-for liberals. If you are a conservative and a fan of Reagan I don't recommend it. Instead, I'd site a work like 'Ronald Reagan' by Dinesh D'Souza."
1,Director's Cut vs Original Release,"I have to agree with other reviews regarding the Director's Cut. I have both versions in VHS, and find the original version far superior. I expected that, like VHS, both versions would be available on DVD, but that hasn't happened yet. How do we let the studio know that what we really want is the original version on DVD? I love this movie, but don't really want to buy the Director's cut on DVD, since I consider it inferior. Thanks..."
2,"One of the single greatest films of all time, released in flawless HD X 5!!!!","Where to begin? Blade Runner is one of the single greatest films of all time. If this movie was simply the Final Cut released with no Special Features it would still be a five star item. However, with the 9 hours of special features and five versions of the film, all in glorious, glorious 1080P this item can truthfully be described as one of the finest film deals available on the market. If you haven't already done so, order this item promptly, it belongs in the Blu Ray Collection of any fan of good movies, and especially any fan of science fiction. The transfer to Blu Ray is phenomenal as it the sound. It is kind of a bummer that the special features are not in HD but that is such a minor point compared to all of the high points of this item that you should not allow it to prevent you from acquiring this item promptly. Simply the best!"
1,ZzZzZzZzZz...,"Everyone says its so great! I must have been watching a different movie. When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a polished version of a fundementally bad movie? Its like taking a class in remedial reading and getting an A; sure its an A, but its not a very tough class."
2,Director cuts out the good stuff,"I have to disagree with the director and with Amazon. The voice-over was great and lent character and atmosphere to the original. Of course, the ending is better and there are some interesting new scenes with Sean Young and Harrison Ford, but Ford's voice and the Vangelis score melded into a wonderful future film noir experience."
1,How do you get the closed captioning to work?,"Closed captioning not available...bummer! Luckily, I still have an older DVD which does have closed captioning. This purchase was a waste of money!"
1,I would give it zero stars if i could.,"Unbelievably terrible movie, and a terrible transfer. I'd go into more detail, but that would require that i think about the movie again, and i refuse to make myself do that."
1,am i the only one who...,"Am I the only one who prefers the original version? Harrison Ford's voiceover added to the film's noir feel, and filled in a few background details that made the story more understandable. Perhaps creative folk are loath to admit that studio execs are sometimes right, even if it's for the wrong reasons. In addition, I LIKE happy endings, and so do most people, which is why moviemakers do them so much."
1,Check Your Discs!,"Search the Web for ""blade runner blu-ray disc return"" and you'll find many people who got mislabeled duplicate discs. Amazon.com will help you out if you check the discs soon enough and find an issue, but if you wait too long Warner Brothers doesn't help. I have called multiple numbers that lead to message recorders. Nobody responds.Check your discs right away; Amazon is your only return option! If you have a bad disc and have waited too long, WB doesn't care."
1,Horrible DVD - Video quality is like unto ancient rental VHS,"The movie is great the quality of this DVD is horrible. It appears to shimmy and shake as if someone were sitting in a theater with a camcorder. Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $1 bin not as a $10 item. You would be better off with VHS or perhaps LaserDisc. Wait for the rumored forthcoming ""definitive"" DVD release by Ridley Scott the director."
2,Director's Cut makes the cut,"When Ridley Scott released Blade Runner in 1982, it showed the world how well the future may look like. Almost a decade later, a Director's Cut was made, and up to now I can never get over the future appearance of Los Angeles. I have to say, the Director's Cut was a lot better, especially the ending. This is definitely one of Ridley Scott's best movies, besides Alien, and provided a great role for Harrison Ford. The visuals are amazing, and has some of the best music by Vangelis. Sci-Fi fans should really invest into seeing this one."
1,A less than stellar DVD,"First off the Director's Cut blatantly disregards most of the book especially at the end. But since I am inclined to base my rating on the DVD itself, I'll not count that against it. My big complaint with Bladerunner is that the movie was released with two versions and only one is present on the DVD. Thus, the viewer is forced to watch the Director's Cut. The DVD is also a little shy on extras. The movie itself isn't too bad, although its pace is a tad slower than many other good science fiction movies and may cause many viewers to become bored. I suggest holding off on purchasing this DVD as it is rumored to be scheduled for re-release around December of this year. Hopefully the new release will have both versions of the film and the additional extras such a famous film deserves"
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,I LOVED THIS ONE IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME MY FULL REVEIW WOULD JUST BE A WASTE JUST OWN THIS MOVIE AND THATS THAT!!!!
2,excellent Blue Ray movie,This 5 disk set for $27 is a good deal. 3 blue ray disks and two DVD disks are in the box.
1,A true classic that deserves better...,"Bladerunner is still one of the finest cyberpunk movie ever made(Fifth Element don't even come close). When it was first aired, there were so may versions of the film. In my opinion, the European version is the best. It certainly has a lot more violence but it made the movie much clearer with Ford's narration and the happy ending that made the film less depressing than it already is. Sadly the DVD lacks all this offering us the director's vision only. Strangely the Criterion Edition LD(which offers the European version)has not made it to the DVD. This is sad considering that Ridley Scott's Legend is given a better treatment on DVD offering two versions of the film in a Collector's Edition(the fantastic director's cut and the horrible U.S version). Hopefully, Bladerunner will be rereleased with both European version and director's cut in the near future(and possibly a 'making of' documentary as well)."
2,Old vs. New,"While received poorly at the box office upon first release, Blade Runner has entrenched itself in the collective minds of moviegoers. Its greatness is evident by the number of new releases who continue to borrow visually from Blade Runner (A.I. and Dark City are prime examples). It is a shame Ridley Scott didn't devote more time to the sci-fi genre, instead of giving us ""classics"" such as White Squall, GI Jane and Hannibal. That aside I must agree with some of the other reviewers. I too enjoy the director's cut more, but would've liked to have seen both versions available. Each version has its own admirable qualities, but I think the narrated original is better for the casual viewer. I tend to straddle the fence of movie snob and ""Joe Popcorn"" and would like to have the option of watching either version as my mood dictates. And in all honesty, the narrated version is probably the only one I could get my girlfriend to watch."
1,@@@@ WARNING @@@@@,BUYER BEWARE ! i ordered this 5 disc blu ray from usa. now i wished i hadn't. it started out being cheaper than ordering from my country canada. it arrived today and disc 5 had a huge crack all the way from the top layer to the bottom. the crack runs from the inner hole to the outside edge. also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut. i wished i'd read these reviews first. shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
2,Amazon needs to sell the original version,"The directors cut is very disappointing. The original with the voice over is better - it fits the piece better as does the music - and even the supposed happy ending is better because that happy ending is tempered by ford's character saying he didn't know how long they'd have together, but then again, who does..."
1,new dvd,Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
2,Another great movie to bring back great memories,"Another fantastic movie that came around at a time when this kind of thing was a lot more possible in peoples' imagination than it is nowadays.Great actors, great movie. I'll be watching this one probably a few times a year just because it's that good (so much better than the garbage coming out of Hollywood for the last decade!)."
2,HD-DVD Final Cut review,"This is a review of the HD-DVD Blade Runner Final Cut only. To put it in prospective I have the Laser Disk and the Director's Cut on DVD.If you have an upscaling DVD player then there is not too much visual improvement to the orginal Director's Cut DVD. What has really improved is the Dolby 5.1 sound. The improvement in the sound quality in the regular Director's Cut to a HD-DVD,Blu-Ray, Regular DVD Final Cut is great.The opening scene when the ships pass over the city, first from front to back L, then from back to front,R, are grealty improved in rear sound quality.Your ears will feel the diference."
1,Bring back the Theatrical Release,"I saw the original theatrical release of Blade Runner and was dismayed years later to learn that the director's cut omits Harrison Fords narrative. Why was the narrative removed? I don't get it.... I want to buy a new, high quality DVD based on the original Blade Runner release where Harrison Ford narrates.... To me, the movie just isn't the same without the narrative sound track."
1,Studio Got Lazy On This One,"Warner Bros. shouldn't have released the Director's Cut by itself. They should have released a Criterion Collection containing the Director's Cut, as well as the Original Trailer, the extra violence only seen overseas, the footage cut from the Workprint (such as the Holden in the Hospital scene, and Zhora's snake dance) and maybe a Director's Commentary since almost every other Ridley Scott DVD has one! The fact of the matter is that there are way too many extra features never before seen to produce a DVD as bare-bones as this one is. Personally i would love to see the trailer, the hospital scene, and the extra violence but unfortunately this basic DVD is all that's out there."
1,I don't understand the hype.,With all the hype this movie is supposed to be like the best movie ever. It's just okay but with such high expectations I'm not impressed.It gets an extra star because it has a very beautiful woman and a good soundtrack.
1,still searching,is it possible to buy the original theatrical version of blade runner on dvd without buying the 5 disc set????
2,No.1 cult movie,"This one has it all;sci-fi,action,mystery and is truly one of a kind.An unforgetable masterpiece that has earned a special place in my collection."
2,Bladerunner special edition is awesome.,"This is impossible to find in Brick&Mortar's anymore, was a breeze to find and order on Amazon, and got it quickly. Also, this is probably one of the best DVD special editions I've picked up in a long time."
2,Blade Runner,"This movie is not one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever done, it's one of the greatest movies ever done, movies like this should be topping all time box office charts, (this movie barely gave any profit when originally released). Harrison Ford chose wisely when commiting to this project another great movie, director Ridley Scott transports us to the future, I wish so badly that time could be changed and this movie would have made lots of money and spawned a couple of good quality sequels. K.W. Jeter wrote three novels that are sequels to this movie, check the first novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge Of Human."
1,ZERO star rating,"I probably should have payed closer attention to what the ""directors cut"" did not include. I thought the other version with Sean Young and Harrison Ford flying off together was definitely a four star rating. And that unicorn dream sequence? Whats up with that? My advice... don't waste your money on this one."
2,"oh, the french *sigh*","Great movie. However, does the french guy not realize the entire point of the movie? He toyed with some of the less important points yet failed to comment on the unicorn. *sigh*hmmm...I didn't write this...but the movie is quite good. The directors cut lacks in many areas however. I would suggest purchasing the original. sorry for the above...I kinda like the french =)"
2,The Best Sci-fi Movie Ever,"Blade Runner (director's cut) has to be my favorite movie; it's special effects and setting are still visually stunning after 20 years, plus the breathtaking soundtrack and story make it a feast for the senses. Very few films can stand the test of time this well, and I cannot gush about this movie enough. It is a work of art."
2,"Really good pursuit, action film","I liked the whole concept of this movie -A bounty hunter in the future, played by Harrison Ford, is told to terminate four replicant beings.Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples (who also wrote UNFORGIVEN) did a very good jobe with the screenplay.Ridley Scott directed and gives us some exciting, albeit brutal, pursuits. Scott seems to be very good at this kind of genre film, or action films.Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead role.Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, Daryl Hannah and the other actors also are perfect in their roles.The music by Vangelis and the cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth are excellent."
1,Missing something...,"Why don't they take Lawrence Sanders' name off the McNally books? Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth, since he makes mistakes with reference to Sanders' stories. Archy states he doesn't want to get married if he can't have a marriage as perfect as his parents. Lardo apparently is unaware that the ""pater"" had an affair in one of Sanders' installments! Archy isn't quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob. Al Rogoff was hardly in this one and I missed him. Archy's living with a girlfriend and there are few references to the McNally ""manse"", dinners with the folks, etc. And the climax was anything but; a true anticlimax that was over before I realized. Time to hang up the series? I do believe."
2,Byrds rock the fillmore,Byrds live at the fillmore is a great live album from the byrds at Fillmore east and features some of the best songs performed live amd is highly recommended.
2,"Story Not As Good As ""What's Up, Doc?"", But Still Very Funny!","Hillary Kramer (Barbra) is a successful Perfume magnate, when she finds out that her accountant has robbed her blind and left for South America. Going through all of her remaining assets she finds a boxer, purchased as a tax write off. She decides to take Eddie Scanlon (Ryan O' Neal) who is much more at home giving driving lessons, into the ring and use him as her key to riches. Eddie thinks this will only get him killed, but Hillary won't give up that easy, nor will Eddie give up that easy from never fighting again. The story lacks originality and farce, which gave ""What's Up, Doc?"" it's brilliance. However Barbra & Ryan are in top form & they are still great and hilarious together!."
2,GREAT TALENT,THIS CD GOES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS MORE THEN ONE TALENT IN THE GROUP PUBLIC ENEMY A GREAT CD WITH SOME GREAT BASS AND RYMES
1,a typical mainstream album,"i heard why and times up and welcome to d block, and i really liked them, anyone i knew that bought it said it was amazing, so i thought it might acually not be as wack as tha rest of tha stuff ppl are puttin out these days.....but i was sadly mistaken, those where tha only good tracks tha rest is unoriginal, unreal, and hes talkin about ice, rims, girls, and killen ppl, he actually says he is rapping for fame on one part of tha album.....THIS IS HIP POP NOT HIP HOP, not for real hip hop fansP.S. Idont know why i even bought it"
1,what the hell did he just say,"Why did Bush knock down the towers??I can't believe he said that sh*t.This guy is an idiot, screw his lyrics, f**k this guy.That song 'Why' sucks anyways. Many of us know about the struggle, I don't need to hear him bitch and cry about it."
2,"""Good Carpenter Documentary DVD!""","John Carpenter: The man who brought you ""Halloween,"" Escape from New York""& more! This dvd that has everything you want to know about the famousdirector with many cast & crew interviews. I'm a big fan and own justabout all of his films. I recommend this good dvd."
1,many flaws outweigh fun,"The game includes nowhere to store the black sheets for the ""screen"". The storage drawer jams every time you close it so opening it tends to result in pegs flying all over the room. You can turn the light on but not off; I seem to recall that we had on/off light technology even way back when I was a kid. The pegs don't stay in well, the blue pegs tend not to glow at all unless they're directly above the light bulb.You'd think with many generations of children to evolve and perfect this toy it would have gotten better rather than worse; your expectations would be frustrated."
1,Over-Hyped,"Despite the advertising, I would say that this book is of little or no use to all but the beginning investor who wants a very easy to manage entry/exit system. I could replicate the ""extensive historical research"" that these ""prominent authors"" have performed for their systems in less than a few days and I'm no expert.There are more pages of text devoted to the history of Fidelity and to an overview and explanation of the Select Funds (the only useful chapter in the book for me) than to the 3 ""powerful mutual fund models"". The ""computer programs"" included on disk are nothing more than incredibly simple spreadsheet templates.I'm not sure if the authors are bull-market opportunists or just naive, but their book was/is a great disappointment to me."
1,TOO LAME!!,"I think it is pathetic that both parties go at it here in the review section. I look to read customer reviews. Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues. I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd's lack of commentary!! And NO, I DON""T WORK FOR WB OR KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES. Let consumers post the reviews!!"
2,They should hav had more stuff!,"the dvd's sound really great and i give it a 4/5 rating with all the extra stuff in it but it could have been a 5! they should have put those 3 video clips that started all this ! i wanted to see ""American History"", ""Jesus vs. Frosty"", and ""The Spirit of Christmas"" on thoses dvd's! maybe theres still time to cram these video clips in the dvd's!"
2,"Classic South Park Goodness...Nothing More, Nothing Less","I don't know why so many people are complaining about this DVD set. You knew what you were getting from the get go. If someone is thinking about this set, let me clarify:-There is nothing mentioned about ""Uncensored Episodes"". The only thing uncensored are the special features & the lead-ins for each episode. If you're expecting more, don't buy it.-Its the ENTIRE first season collected in one low-cost set. Yes these episodes are already available on DVD, but now the whole first year is in a collected set, and previously mentioned, cheaper than buying the separate DVDs.-Also, the commentary. Evidentially, it was SOOO controversial that it had to be REMOVED from the DVDs! Now you can get them by sending in the UPC, which I know is a pain, but from what I hear, its worth it!-Lastly, ITS SOUTH PARK! Any true fan will buy this set & like it without crying.I frankly can't wait for the next season! South Park: Buy it...Watch it...Love it!"
2,"Great start, great middle, okay finish","This book started out in a way that I could not put it down. It was a very interesting and well written beginning. Unfortunately, the narrative broke down a bit towards the end. I was able to predict what was happening about 100 pages before everything was explained. To me this lessens the quality of the book.However, much of the information on psychology given in the book was absolutely fascinating since I do not have any sort of background in it."
2,Read the last 150 pages in one sitting,I was so into this book I read the last 150 pages in one sitting.
1,Awful piece of junk!,My son wanted this toy so badly for his birthday. I finally found the only one in town and it is a disaster. How difficult would it have been for the designers to actually figure a way for the arms to lock in place?? They do not stay in the back at all. This toy has since caused tears and frustration. Don't buy this piece of junk!
1,Not reader friendly,I should have paid attention to other reviews. Was looking forward to reading selected works by Edgar Allen Poe on my Kindle but determined immediately that it was impossible to go to a specific selection. This has been set up like that of a novel. If the reader wants to go to a certain selection scanning through every page to get to that selection is required. Using the Go To feature on the Kindle was not helpful either since a location for each story/subject was not indicated in the Table of Contents. I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it. Will probably just delete it.
1,Unorganized impossible to navigate,"Save your dollar. The kindle edition does not have any ability to easily navigate. You will essentially have to manually wade through the extensive collectioin of Poe stories which is cubersome and ineffecient. As well, this edition was linked next to a volume for stories and poems and the kindle edition only has stories."
2,This joint gets 10 mikes,"For 80deca, true school hip hop fans, this is one of tightest albums feturing 2 unsung, caucasion MC's who simply can rip a mike. Prime Minister Pete Nice and MC Search compliment each other like peanut butter does jelly. 10 years later, this album still sits in my tape player. Big ups to all those who are still avid fans!"
2,These aren't my clothes...,"When friends come over for movie night, the first thing I always ask them is; have you ever seen 'True Romance'? It is always my first pick out of the 1100 movies I own, when company comes. It is Tony Scott's masterpiece, and the best thing Quentin ever wrote. Over the top, way way violent, and unforgettable performances by a star-studded cast. So many memorable lines to add to the pop culture. And am still amazed at how unknown this film is to movie fans! Tony Scott will always be remembered as a high octane film maker. One who could make sense out of the kinetic editing process, to give us many thrills. Thanks for the wild ride Tony, may you rest in peace."
2,One of my favorites,"Written my Tarantino this film is one of my favorites and my favorites of his. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are excellent in it, it's a fun, very 90's wild romp! It'll make you want to go on a road trip and talk in a Southern accent. Oh - and do it in a phone booth."
1,Check what region your in....,Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
2,A DVD review,This DVD doesn't have much to offer other than a great movie with a bunch of cameos from some big name actors. A good DVD to have in the collection if you liked the film.
2,A classic,"I grew up listening to Raffi, so my mother naturally bought this CD for my 7 month old son, when he was 4 months old. The CD is a lot of fun to sing to, and when he's fussy all I need to do is sing the first line of ""The More We Get Together"", ""Five Little Frogs"", or ""Aikendrum"" and he smiles right away and cheers up. I'd recommend it for parents who are looking for fun and simple songs to sing to their children."
2,Great songs! Our children love Raffi,"If you haven't been introduced to Raffi, what are you waiting for! Our boy and girl love the books and the songs. Anything Raffi is generally a hit with them. My recommendation to parents or grandparents is to take time to learn the songs and sing the books - you will entertain your children and they will consider you a rockstar! The CD and/or books make great gifts too!"
2,"I LOVE this CD (oh, and so do my kids)","I think this is one of the BEST Raffi cd's. I purchased it on a whim, not really sure which children cd i should buy. Well, my kids (2 and 5) LOVE this cd!!! The songs are really catchy and we find ourselves singing them throughout the day without the cd playing. Even my husband sings them. I really enjoy this cd and have since purchased another Raffi cd, which my kids also enjoy."
1,I know he's popular -- but I can't stand to hear his voice!,"I know that Raffi is one of the most popular kid's singers. You can't go into a kids music section without seeing his face everywhere. I tried to like him, I really did. But his voice annoys the heck out of me. Doesn't anyone else notice that this guy can't sing? Yuck.Buy Kimbo's ""Six Little Ducks"", or Greg & Steve's ""Big Fun"", or Joanie Bartels ""Bathtime Magic"". In short, buy anything else!"
2,ruler in the rapgame,"foreshadowed and epitomized the pimpster attitude of many rappers during the late '80s and '90s,with gold chains, his eye-patch.Whit his irreverent,humorous,smart and rebellious style he is the King in the rapgame. bye all his albums!!"
2,love it but 4 stars not 5,"Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating ""when I was a young boy..."" then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind. Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples. The examples even have examples. Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3. Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox."
1,Doesn't Matter,The first 2/3 of this movie are spent developing the characters of Liu Xing and Prof Reiser and then all the strongest character traits of those two people are just tossed aside for the ridiculous ending. That made the entire film a complete waste of time. You're left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why. Anyone with a shred of intellect isn't going to be moved by this except maybe to anger at having squandered 90 minutes on it. It could have been a decent movie. It did have a really cheap quality about it as you never see ANY other students at the school.
2,great movie!!,"Very powerful and artistic movie, but a sad story.Ye Liu is a great actor and the character he played was a scary guy!"
1,Not one of her better ones!!,"As I have a collection of all of Meryl Streep's movies, I added this one but upon watching it couldn't really get into it. Found it rather gruesome, weird and sad. To me it was not one of her better movies so I would not recommend it."
1,Defected Book!,1 star because the book was deffected!This book arrived on time and was in excellent condition. Upon reading the book to my daughter I noticed the pages were out of order. Please contact me so that I may persue getting another copy.
2,Excellent and Interesting,"This book is a highly readable work of scholarship, showing us a huge slice of humanhistory that is often hidden and suppressed in our culture - that of the jockeying forpower at the juncture of several very archetypal and powerful issues in our culture-gender, health, and power. Anyone who wishes to truly understand the contemporary statusof natural healing and our current corrosive corporate politics should read this enjoyableand insightful book."
1,HOLY JESUS!,"What the (blank) happened to Pete Nice? I had always wondered what happened to the Prime Minister after 3rd Bass imploded. I knew Serch put out a CD but I never even knew Pete did until recently. Sadly.... now I know why! I could barely even listen to this CD and haven't touched it since. If you wore out your 3rd Bass tapes back in the day and want to hear Prime Minister in action again... Just get the 3rd Bass CD's and forget this crap! Oh don't believe me?? Check out how much it's selling for.***UPDATE*** 01/24/13I've listened to this CD several hundred times since 2005 and I'll admit it.... I WAS WRONG! The Lumberjack, The Rhapsody (in J minor), Kick the Bobo and Blowin' Smoke! Pete was getting down like Charlie Brown! Guess I was so used to 3rd Bass I just couldn't hear it. This one is a gem buy it."
2,4.5 stars actually,"first of all, you need to buy good batteries for this camera. I bought a 100-pack of cheapies and they don't last but a few hours- if they work. Good batteries like energizer will last you a few weeks. I own a Mac and the pictures transfer easily onto iphoto. the 4x optical zoom is a nice improvement from our other 3x zoom on our sony. I was able to buy a 2GB memory card for $20(sandisk) from here also. There are also high speed cards available. I'm already satisfied with the standard one. I don't do a lot of ""quick"" shots anyways.Only one drawback. The video doesn't show up on my imovie. maybe I need more experimenting. I just assumed it would be as easy as the pictures.Overall, I am surprisingly satisfied with this canon product. Especially after being a sony fan for years."
1,Avoid this seller!,"We ordered this camera for our daughter. We have never had any issues with having things arrive from Amazon sellers but this camera came to us in a flat rate envelope wrapped in bubble wrap. Nothing else. No original box either, nothing except the SD card that still had someone else's personal pictures on it. The box was pretty much flattened in the mailing process and the cameras' internal lens was totally crushed. When we contacted the seller we were told that's how he always mails things and never had any issues in the past. He even neglected to respond when we asked for at least a credit for another camera. I understand that things get lost/damaged in the mail but to send a camera through the mail without much more than one sheet of bubble wrap and the mailing envelope is ridiculous! Save yourself the frustration, time and money - buy elsewhere."
2,Canon Powershot digital camera,"I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! The pictures are sharp and clear, and the camera is so easy to use.My daughter loves all the features on it. We would buy this camera again, maybe for myself next time!"
1,workmanship,"The workmanship in this 6th Edition is less than satisfactory. Several of my fellow seminar students had their books split upon opening the front cover of the hardback. Apparently, the inside of the cover and first page are defective, either in material or application. My copy has not split yet. However, it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time. I hope the appropriate person at Amazon reads this."
2,An Essential Book,"There are very few books that are essential for one's personal library, but this book qualifies. One can argue the point, but you are pretty safe in saying that Shakespeare is the great writer of all-time. This collection of his works is magnificently edited by David Bevington. If you've never read anything by Shakespeare or read and re-read him a million times, you shouldn't be without this anthology."
2,This is what i'm waiting for!!!!,"In Flames and Soilwork are sold out, so my only chance to find another album that blow my mind like Dark Tranqility's ""Character"", is this. This album is solid musicianship throghout. There's no filler here or the commercial flavor like the other two(In Flames, Soilwork), this is great melodic death metal with no complaints!!! There's industrial touches like in ""Character"", but sounds really good. Check this out, you won't regret it."
1,Disappointing Book,"What about reading about an artwork:""This painter is in its best. His paint is full of movement and color, and it represents the best of this period of the art.""And then you look for the picture and did not find it. Or in the best case scenario, you find a small, black and white, pale picture of the paint.That's what happens in this book.Disappointing :-("
1,Interesting but with one MAJOR flaw,"An interesting author who knows his art but I found this a frustrating book to read because Hoving describes one great piece of artwork after another but only a small number are actually illustrated. Even a bad picture is better than no picture. The author tries his best but the beauty of words just don't measure up to the beauty of the artwork. Next time, the publisher should spend a couple of extra bucks and put in a few more pictures for us dummies out there who are not as knowledgeable as Hoving. They have, to their credit, included some nice color pages in the front and end of the book."
2,GREAT SOUND...GREAT VALUE,"It was time to replace my 25 year old Technics towers. I wanted something much smaller, without giving up the great sound I was accustom to. I listened to a lotta speakers from Bose, Wharfdale, Polk, and for the money, these were by far the best. Good bass, crisp highs & rich midrange sound. I'm very happy with these & I hope they last as long as my last set."
2,Very nice,I got these speakers promptly and they are indeed a first class product. The first thing I noticed was howheavy they are. These things must have some serious magnets in them. FWTW. They really do sound good thoughSony nailed this deal.
2,Exceptional speakers,"Recently bought the Sony SS-B3000 speakers. As many have mentioned are a little larger than most bookshelf speakers. However, these speakers are an exceptional value for the money. Plus they sound fantastic, clear highs, smooth mid-range and good bass response. Most music lovers will be satisfied with the sound and these are also nice looking speakers. You cannot go wrong."
1,Sony Speakers,"Ordered Sony Speakers per a good review online. They arrived on time, but did not satisfy my ears. Their sound was adequate, but I planned to use them for listening to vinyl albums and like a crisp sound. I returned them and ordered Bose 301's which work great for me. Thank you."
1,Reading this book was hardly worth the struggle.,"Lucia Robson St.Clair's novels have always been in the ""can hardly put it down"" catagory but this recent novel""Mary's Land"" set in early Maryland history was a struggle to read. The story began with the promise of another wonderful historical drama but after the main characters landed in the colonies and began their new life,the story started to wander and never seemed to find its footing again.I was discouraged but glad to read comments from other readers. I learned I was not her only fan who must have been shaking their heads and furrowing their brows as they struggled through this recent novel by a favored author."
2,Byrds Untitled originally vinyl 2 LP set.,The Byrds UntitledA valuable part of my Byrds music library that used to have as a vinyl 2 LP set. I am rebuilding the Byrds music library with CDs.
2,"THREE AND A HALF STARS, (there are no half stars)","Paula Cole's CD, Amen, certainly does not have the same caliber music as her previous one. By far her best one so far has been Harbinger. Amen has at times very cliche lyrics, but her guitar and drummer are both great on this album, (most people reviewing seemed to forget that it is now the Paula Cole BAND). I do like some of the songs, and DJ Premier is a fine DJ. All and all it is a swell album, and I would recommend it."
2,I loved this CD!,"In moments of creativity, you can only hope to put as much of yourself as possible in your work. That's what Paula Cole has achieved with ""Amen"". In this eclectic mix of funk, pop tunes, and bluesy numbers, you not only hear and feel her struggle for love, inner peace, political righteousness, and a life of spiritual meaning - you want it too. Honestly, there are a few ""fillers"" in the album, hence the 4 star rating. But with evocative tracks such as ""I Believe in Love"", ""Amen"", ""Pearl"" and ""Be Somebody"", these ""fillers"" are forgiven. In short, Paula Cole offers a musical reflection of herself and ourselves as well in our struggle for harmony in our personal relationships, our humanitarian responsibility in the world, and our spiritual balance in the universe."
2,A different album from Paula- yet a much needed one.,"I'm a little surprised that so many people would come on to post such negativities about this new album or about Paula herself. I have been a fan of hers for well over 3 years, and will continue to be. This is a remarkable, powerful, and unusual album. It's great. She does a remarkable job both in her compositions, her vocals, and her lyrics. Hey, and to all you people out there who, like me, support Paula in this effort, remember one thing about some of these negative and weird comments from people; remember that not everyone is blessed with intelligence!"
1,Paula Morissette?,"This is Ms. Cole's worst offering. I totally loved ""This Fire"" and most of ""Harbringer"". This album is laced with Mariah Carey sounding vocals (who's doing the high stuff? - NOT Ms. Cole), Alanis 90's disco grooves, and Dr. Dre sounding beats. Her lyrics I might give 2 stars to, but there very self-centered and pretentious most of the time. This was a drag becuase I have been a fan of Paula's since her days with Peter Gabriel - but this ""Amen"" album is terrible. I was totally dissapointed. Thanks for selling out, Paula."
1,sucks,overrated fan. just go to lowes or home depot and save money and get something you can return in person.
2,Miracle cure,"I have suffered from insomnia for close to 8 years. After trying every herbal remedy available, I finally reached for Ambien. After two years of Ambien use, I still struggled with a decent night sleep, battling depression as a side-effect of the drug.Last month I ordered Roberta Shapiro's Sleep Solutions CD and am so glad I did! For the first time in years, I am able to go to sleep and stay asleep. The CD offers recordings for the purpose of falling asleep, as well as some shorter recordings to equip the listener to get back to sleep easily if sleep gets interrupted.I find Roberta's voice very calming, and she clearly has a great understanding of what insomniacs have to overcome. If you struggle with sleep issues, this CD is a wonderful solution."
2,Excellent,"This is an excellent sleep aid. Although my sleeep problem had not been fallng asleep, I find this CD helps me fall into a deeper sleep. Although I have experienced periods of wakefulness during the night, using this CD has meant that the wakefulness is far less. I went from 40-50% wakeful to 5-15% wakeful. It is very seldom now that I get out of bed during the night. Highly recommended."
2,Impressive Sleep CD,"I have finally found an effective safe method of getting a restful night's sleep. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has ever had a fitful night's sleep.Jonathan Rubin, MD"
2,Perfect Background Music for a Bachelor's Pad,"While ""Night Lights"" would be perfect for a romantic evening, it also stands up well to serious examination. The original Philips vinyl LP is fairly rare now, but was one of my most valued jazz albums. It sure is nice that the jazz catalog CD re-issue wave is including this beautiful work of art. Bobby Brookmeyer on valve trombone, Jim Hall on guitar, Art Farmer on trumpet and of course Gerry Mullgan on baritone sax are at the top of their form in this early 1960's small big band date. This was recorded shortly after the Concert Jazz Band period for Mulligan and further testifies to his abilities as a top-notch arranger. You might also check out these earlier big band recordings on Verve - Gerry Mulligan and The Concert Jazz Band ""Live At The Village Vanguard"" is the one most accessible currently, although there are others to be found on CD."
1,High Hunt by David Eddings,"Not a too great book, at least not nearly as good as""The Malloreon"", ""Elenium"" or ""Tamuli"" which are all very good books. Very exiting and reads easy!"
1,Waste Of Money!,"A lot of the book was based on any breed. In the training section, it was hard to understand what they were saying. I own two Chis of my own and thier behavior was not as nearly bad as the book described the attitude! I might as read a book about German Shepards!"
1,Don't do it.,"When I built my computer, I was stupid and wanted it to be obnoxiously illuminated and filled with cathode lights and LED's and EL wire. I regret all that now, and I also regret this mouse pad. It's bulky but provides little room, the colors are a stupid novelty that wear off after a day or two, and it absolutely kills teflon feet."
2,In a class all his own,"I learned a lot about playing blues piano from listening to Ray Bryant (not that I know 1/100th of what Bryant knows....). Bryant has a style all his own. He is a master cook. All the tracks on this classic disk swing, and the trio musicians are in perfect sync with each other. This is pure jazz with its roots in the blues, pure joyful inventiveness and rhythm - which is what jazz is all bout. (There is NO harmonica on this album.)"
2,Perfection,"I, the instant I saw an episode of the Zoid series, thought that it was completely awsome!!! Zoids is 100% better than ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" or ""Pokemon"" or ""Digimon."" It is totally cool. Once you see, it you'll love it."
2,my 2nd fav. by her,"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I bought the 4gig memory and only one worked. Tried to return it and was given the run around for almost two months. They told me to send it to amazon, amazon told me to send it them and back and forth. I was going to spend a little more and buy something different from them but after all the hassle, NO WAY."
2,Cat's Eye,This is one of the many Stephen King classics. Definately should be on DVD for future generations to enjoy. A riveting tale of a cat's quest to teach errie lessons and save the day. Looking forward to the DVD!
2,Scooter Mirror,"This is a well made and super easy to install mirror, after receiving the first one I ordered a second for the other side."
2,Solid and sharp,"I had to cut the grip on my handlebars to install the mirror but it works great. It looks solid and visibility is excellent. Tightened up secure, instructions were easy. I like it."
2,Best Mirror on the Market!,My Mirrycle MTB is now on it's second bike. I did have to replace the mirror part after dropping the bike...no fault of the mirror itself. It stays in place and gives a wide view of what's behind you.
2,"Nice mirror for the price, but you may need to lube the cap screws","I was looking for a simple mirror that wasn't too expensive and this one did just that. I was also interested in something that would not break if the bike tipped, so the option to mount this toward the ""inside"" of the handlebar instead of the outside was attractive to me.I noticed some of the negative reviews centered on the mounting ""screws"" being too tight and of a non-standard size. I found this to be true for me as well. The cap screws would only go in a couple turns before binding up and making me fearful of breaking the plastic parts. I tried to ""clean"" the threads with a metric tap and die but it appeared to be 4mm x .8, which I did not have. In desperation I sprayed some teflon lubricant onto the threads. This worked wonderfully and I was able to connect all parts with the supplied hex-wrench without fear of breakage.This will now allow my wife to see how far I am behind her when we ride! :-)"
2,Mirrycle MTB Bicycle Mirror,"A great value and looks cool on my bicycle. It comes complete with detailed instructions and the appropriate Allen Wrench. The instructions call for using a knife to cut away the covering at the end of your handle bar. For a much safer installation, use a step-bit and drill.If I were to fault this mirror in any way it would be this: From the photo it appears that the mirror's upright tube is flexible - it is not. Those baffles are just for show.A rear-view mirror is an essential safety tool only following in importance the use of a helmet. I am a teacher and ride my bike over city streets to work every day."
1,Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality????,"My last Mirrycle was purchased some 21 years ago and used on the same bike until recently when it broke.The same new one arrives from Amazon, must be made by exceptionally inferior manufacturer, the plastic simply broken into pieces when you tried to assemble the unit. I am now having a pile of broken plastics...."
1,Cheap and horrible design,"I mounted this mirror on my bike, and THE NEXT DAY I accidentally tipped my bike over on the side that the mirror was mounted on, and the mirror hit the ground. Luckily for me, the mirror is made out of glass and it shattered on impact. I guess this product is too cheap to be made with any type of shock-proof material. Oh well, $15 lost and a lesson learned."
2,Great mirror!,I've had one of these mirrors on my bike for seven years. I liked it so much that I ordered one for my husband's new bike. It's easy to install and a tough little mirror. It's been crunched several times and I'm always able to readjust it just fine.
2,Great Little Mirror!,"Bought a couple of these for our bicycles.Had to slightly modify my handlebar grip to install.When installed, the mirror is very secure, can be easily adjusted and maintains its position.I guess it's about the perfect size for a bicycle.I wouldn't ride without this mirror now.Highly recommended."
2,Works with a road bike!,"I bought this for my road bike and it fits in the end of the drop bar. I left out the middle piece and it works well. The only potential problem would be in case of a fall, as the mirror is quite rigid when installed. Great image quality, and I have grown quite accustomed to having a mirror in just a few weeks."
2,A must have,"And after a mile of riding after mounting this, I wondered how I could have ever lived without rear view mirror on my bike. The only ""con"" is that it is very difficult to mount (you do need lots of strength to tighten it up), but it's also a plus because one it's on, it stays one (you really don't want the mirror to swivel or move every time you hit a pothole or go over a bump). I've dropped my bike a few time and the mirror did not break."
2,Great Bicycle Mirror,"This is a great Bicycle Mirror, and if you ride in traffic an invaluable safety feature.Installation is easy but READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST! The screws have a locking feature so they're VERY hard to turn. Use an appropriately sized screwdriver, installing the assembled unit as the LAST step in the process. Tighten the screws just tight enough so that the unit can be adjusted following installation, but not loose enough that bumps will 're-adjust' its position."
2,Good mirror,"This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection. It's very clear, even around the edges, and is actually glass and not plastic. Unfortunately, I dropped and broke it before I could use it, so I can't comment on how it functioned."
2,Mirrycycle mryycle,"I have owned these mirrors for years. They can be positioned under the left handlebar also, with the mirror pointing toward the stem. You can still see behind you and the mirror won't constantly clang into things and you won't look like some sort of Shriner nerd."
1,Poor Quality -- A Name Brand Signifying Nothing Today,"Well, big surprise -- you get what you pay for. I got this set a year or so ago for about $5.00. Can't complain on the price, but the smaller knife was garbage. It had a blade that just flopped limply about between the closed and fully opened (locked) position. And there was also a ding type flaw in the blade. Useless crapper. The big one is OK for a letter or box opener I guess, but no guarantees. I've never used it. Winchester name is not wisely used here -- just another cheap Chinese import."
1,Flip Album:(,This company has a set of business ethics which are questionable. The owner of Flip Books (EBooksystems) plasters their name and links to their website all over your finished work.
1,Disco is Over,I always considered myself the ultimate Donna Summer Fan..butwhen this long awaited Geffen release hit the air waves I knewDisco was over..I have never been so disappointed in an album..even though I remember the first time I heard Hotstuff its hard rock edge I knew things were changing...
2,Donna's not just a Disco Queen,"""The Wanderer,""really show's what a fantastic Artist Donna is.She really reaches a new level on this album.I had a Christmas party in the early 80's,and when I put on this record,everyone loved it.If anyone doesn't have this tape,you've got to get it.I believe its Donna Summer's greatest album.Also,years later we saw Donna sitting at a counter in Atlantic City drinking cofee.When people went up to her,she was very friendly.A wonder person off stage as well."
1,Visit Bruce Damer's Website,"With all due respect to Mr. Damer, this book is basically an introduction to what Avatars and Virtual Communities are. Mr. Damer provides a guided tour of several online communities. One or more of thewe worlds no longer exist. This is another example of web-time and how difficult it is to publish a book with a technology topic. I found the book very basic. Visit his web site to learn all you need to know and be introduced to the awesome online worlds. . . and save some money."
1,Morbid Ending,"If you're expecting Mark Twain's usual funny and cheerful stories, stay away from this one.*Spoiler alert!*The ending is simply sad."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT GET THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!! IF YOU WANT A FUN BOOK TO READ, THIS IS THE WRONG ONE!!!! I READ 3 CHAPTERS AND IT IS UNBEARABLE!!!!! IT IS SO SAD AND TERRIBLE!!!!!! DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER CONSIDER GETTING THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CONSIDER THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not What I Expected,"I've purchased loads of stuff from Amazon and have been happy with my purchases. This is my first disappointment. First, I did not receive what is pictured. The tool is ""similar"" but cheaper looking. Second, the ""set"" end of the tool is not round (it's kinda oval - poorly ground), nor does it have a concave end as better nail sets do. It tends to skip off nail heads. I'm into multi-tasking tools. So if all I get for my $ 10 is a mini nail puller - it will sit and rust in my box!For your 10 bucks buy sets made by Starrett $ 10 each - they're perfect."
1,Not as good as Mame,"I watched Mame with Lucille Ball and enjoyed it very much. Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell was such a let down that it has been a struggle to watch the whole film. Perhaps it is because Miss Russell looks like she is acting and Miss Ball IS Mame. Or it could be that there is no music or singing in Auntie Mame, the singing in Mame made it a joy to watch over and over. I doubt that I will watch Auntie Mame a second time."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I just don't get it. I had heard so much about this movie, that I just had to have it. Boy was I disappointed. Not funny. Not entertaining. Just a lot of ""dahling"" this, and ""dahling"" that with no substance. Rent it, but don't buy it. I already gave my copy away."
1,Lucille Balls version was much better....,I found the movie Auntie Mame a huge dissapointment.If you enjoyed Auntie Mame I highly suggest that you see MAME which is a musical version of Auntie MAME and Stars Lucille Ball.MAME is one hundred million times better.
2,A bit of Sunshine in a Box,I had an Auntie Mame in my life and before she died recently I gave her a copy of this movie and we watched it together and laughed and reminisced together and just enjoyed the movie and each other's company. Then she was gone. I'll always treasure that day and the memories I made with my Auntie Mame. Don't pass up an opportunity to enjoy true entertainment - and have a few tissues handy too!
2,A CLASSIC!,"I always look at this film around Christmas time. It never lets me down for getting me into the holiday mood. One of the greatest comedies ever made. From Agnes Gooche's ""How Bleak Was My Puberty"", to the ever up-beat Rosalind Russell""s Auntie Mame, the laughs are always there. The fox hunt is a side splitter. I'm sure everyone who is anyone will benefit from seeing this film. Especially around the holidays. ciao yaaah69"
2,Great Wireless Headphones !,"This set of headphones is just right. Good plastic; headgear that is not overly fussy; responsive buttons with good button feel. Tuning is immediate, and the transmission is good. The ear cushions are great... very soft vinyl.I have a earlier model AR wireless headphone set which I like, but those earlier phones are bulky, made of cheap plastic... with foam earpieces that don't feel that great.These new AR772 phones are easy to carry and wear. The recharging unit works nicely with no fuss. The sound is great."
2,Love this product!,Product great. Had one small problem with the product. But seller turned around and made it right. Very quick. I would buy from this seller anytime!!!!
2,good christmas songs,"This is a good cd. It has some traditional christmas music, and a few cute little songs but stays with the reasonable realm. It is typical of Raffi's style and the kids love it."
2,Electric Light Orchestra - Part II - One Night Live in Australia '95,"The title of this DVD is misleading, as it is not their complete concert from Sydney Australia.This is the same DVD that has been released as ""Access All Areas"".It consists of interviews with the bands members, intermixed with concert footage.It is still a very good production and I recommend it to any ELO/ELO part2 fans. I was a little disappointed as it wasn't what I was expecting as I already own a copy of Access All Areas."
2,Excellent,"Kneipp's bath oils are the best on the market. This is my particular favorite, but I use several and have for many years. The company produces the highest quality of bath products."
1,"Better, cheaper options available","Poorly built and fragile, received this one as a gift and it broke very soon after we got it.We have the Rubbermaid mixing pitcher that we've used for years with no problems. It is cheaper and has a much better designed lid.If you want a mixing pitcher, this is not the one you want."
2,So warm and cozy!!!!,"I live in New York and find the winters a little tough for my ""little tootsies"". I moved here from California and never know my feet could get so cold. However, since I bought these North Face boots my feet have been warm, snug and happy! Even on the coldest, snowiest days, trudging around in wet slush, my feet stay warm! I am in awe! I LOVE these boots!P.S. They run true to size"
2,search this out please!,"it's so amazingly brilliant/pretty.even my acquaintances who don't like shoegazey stuff likethis. ""something goes wrong"" is one of the mostappallingly good and simple songs i have ever heard.the stars of this band were the drummer jim goodall(a monster!) and of course braddy the brat (brilliant,knows it). i used to write them off as mbv rips--then i got this...and went back to the equally enticing ""shot forth self living""""the buried life"" title cribbed from a Matthew Arnold poem, by the by. the shot forth from Blake, i think?! i think goodall dreamed that up cause my friend said he reads Joyce and stuff. a drummer-reader? amazing. i loves the meds!!!"
1,A young girl experiences world war 2 as a jewish girl,This book was very interesting. The topic at least. Most of the Characters were not described in detail so it was hardly ever sad. Th plot skipped around alot so unless you can understand difficult reading I would not recommend it.
2,Engaging,This book gives you a good look into what the people on our police forces go through every day of their lives. Its enough to make a person wonder why anyone would ever decide to do this job.
2,I can still quote this book years later,"This is such a memorable book I can still quote it years after reading it. For example, a cop puts someone in a holding cell. He comes back later and can tell instantly if the person is guilty or not. How does he know? Read the book! Or how does a cop look at the home of an 80-year-old man and know he's a child molester? Then there's the story of the mobster who actually says, ""It's so hard to find good help."" One cop tells what child molesters say when they're captured, how they sickly view the relationship with the child. There's the capture of a child molester after a kid describes lots of yellow doors and seeing a plane through the ceiling -- this book just captures the attention with lots of quick, compelling stories. Very well done, worth reading!"
2,Couldn't put it down...,"I thought the stories in this book were good for the length of each one. I have to say that ""Captivated by You"" was the best of all three. If you like short, steamy, predictable stories you'll like this book!"
2,"Excellent Book, but full of Errors","This book is a MUST HAVE if you plan on working with XML within Flash. The book covers all the details of working with ActionScript and XML. I started out with little knowledge of ActionScript and working with the ActionScript associated with Flash's XML objects and methods. The authors explain almost every thing so clearly, that you understand not only how to work with the XML objects and methods, but how to work with ActionScript. I've found that there are quite a few errors that cause things not to work, which kind of bugged. But with my new knowledge was able to correct the bugs. .... I gave it 4 stars because it was enjoyable learning, easy to understand and I was able to do what I wanted...Learn XML in Flash, I would have given it a +5 if the errors wouldn't have been there."
1,Does not work with Lifeproof Iphone Case,I just received the dock extender and it does not work with the LifeProof case. Has anyone gotten it to work with the Lifeproof case? It does not seem to be long enough to reach the phone.
1,"Great Film, Horrible transfer to DVD","Gold Rush is a one of the best movies ever so unless you really dislike silent movies, it's a must see. Anyway, all my complaining that follows has to do with the this particular transfer to DVD. The DVD is simply awful. Don't get it. The contrast is so messed up that almost everything in the picture is either completely black or completely white. Needless to say, a lot of information is lost. A while ago I have seen a cleaned up version of the film that was excellent so I know that it makes sense to wait for someone to do better job of transfer to DVD."
1,&#65533;I Am Not Amused&#65533;,"Watching The Gold Rush, I understand why Chaplin had trouble achieving a breakthrough in Britain. The humour in the film is very unsophisticated, at times even ridiculous. Chaplin has had 4 or 5 ideas for 'funny' situations, and has then tried to link them together to a film. A few of the situations are a bit funny, but the film as a whole is not funny at all."
1,This DVD is pure garbage. I plan to use it as a coaster.,Don't waste your money on this one. The transfer is so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. This movie is a classic and it is just a shame that the producers of this DVD obviously have no respect for it. This is the last time I buy anything from this company.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,Carly couldn't have selected a worse bunch of songs to cover. Oh Suzanna...come on now! Same dull monotone throughout the cd. One redeeming feature it may get your youngsters so bored they will fall asleep quickly at bedtime.
2,Simply Beautiful!,listening to this spare yet very elegant album is a joy indeed! goes to show why we fell in love with Carly in the first place.
2,"""Wings Over America"" shows the band could really rock","For Christmas 1976, Wings released the triple live set of their most triumphant tour. Most of the material is from ""Band On The Run"", ""Venus And Mars"", and ""Wings At The Speed Of Sound"", as well as a few Beatle hits. The band here comes off rocking harder than their studio albums would lead you to believe, and you often can't help but remember what the excitement was all about then. A great show."
2,Definitive In Many Many Ways,"This is one of the best live recordings of McCartney I have ever heard, and I say that having collected Beatle-related releases for many years. If you want the definitive version of ""Maybe I'm Amazed,"" this one's for you. If you want to hear what the Beatles circa 1975 would have sounded like, check out ""Call Me Back,"" perhaps one of McCartney's finest vocal performances ever. The lovely ""Blackbird"" puts in an appearance, as does a chilling and memorable performance of ""Yesterday."" ""The Long and Winding Road,"" with its beautiful, Penny Lane-like interlude and harmonious rejoinder, ""don't keep me waiting,"" is another highlight not to miss. The Wings stuff is pretty good, too, but if you love McCartney, you don't want to miss this one."
2,Shark is right,"This saw cuts fast and straight. I cut PT 5x5's flat and straight no problem. Pulling to cut lends to accuracy and ease. Handle sucked, I replaced it with an old wooden handle, now it's perfect."
1,one of Mandys worst movies,"This movie was one of Mandy Moores earliest movies. Her acting was good, she looked real good, and she gets turned down, get real directors, not likely to happen in real life. Franka Potente looks too old and too hard for this movie. The story is weak and unrealistic, Elija is ok, but plays the part of a stupid dude. Don't waste your money, unless you just want to see how a bad script is made into a bad movie."
2,"Great product, great vendor","I have used guai from Fludan for probably 5 years now for fibromyalgia. They are a great vendor. I used the powder for a while, but switched to the 600 mg capsules. Since the product base is powder, I think it appropriate to comment even though I got tired of stuffing my own capsules. (I do still have the equipment though to create my own capsules.)I order in bulk now and it lasts me probably a year at a time.Pay by check if you can, save the international conversion fees.I highly recommend Fludan's products. I have used a variety of 100% guai over the years from different vendors, and rate their product, customer service, and delivery the best."
1,"How long will this be ""Under Review"" ?","I have been waiting to be able to purchase this for weeks now, but the item is ""under review"". I've contacted Amazon support staff who seemingly made no effort to investigate the issue directly, or suggest a time at which it might become available for purchase again. I'm very disappointed and frustrated by this situation, and the lack of useful customer support. Please attend to this issue as soon as possible."
2,performing betty in the crucible,"My name is Marissa and this freshman year of my high school career i am playing betty from the crucible. because of this experience, i have become very familiar with the play. based on the salem witch trials, abigail williams is accused of having been owned by the devil. written in a fascinating way, arthur miller really makes this play an extraordinary doing. i reccomend this book for basically anybody, it is a great type of writing for anyone to read."
2,On the subject of symbolism in 'The Crucible',"I enjoyed this play very much. Although historically relevant to the salem witch trials in my opinion this play's meaning had little to do with them. What I see Miller focusing on is more the symbolism of the events transpiring within and their relation to modern events (e.g. The Mcarthy Trials). While portraying what happened in Salem during that era, what Miller is focusing on and what he try's to inform you he is focusing on is how he feels it relates to the times in which he lived. Not as a historical account, but dealing with the act's of propoganda, lie's, and how gullible people are to be drawn into a web of deceit such as portrayed within the play"
2,The book showed how stupid and gulable people can be.,"The book had a lot of interesting conflicts. It showed how easily people can be decieved. If they want to believe they will believe anything. The people pointing the finger were very quick to judge and very quick to accuse. The book was kind of almost unreal. It was hard to believe. I know that it was based on what really happened, but I think that the events were kind of extreme"
1,Missing Lines,"This was supposed to be an unabridged version. It is not. Thus, the audio is not helpful when trying to use it while reading the play -- there is nothing like missing whole sections of the play while trying to find where the cast has skipped to next. Also, the way that the characters are interpreted make the Puritans out to be cartoonish. Perhaps, that is the way that some view the Puritans (or other highly religious people), however, when combined with some of Miller's lines (which can at times come across like a bad church play), the characters lack genuineness. As someone with a theater background, I kept on wondering what Abigail's character would be liked if played straight. Anyway, the main thing, be aware that you aren't buying the entire play."
2,Great Sound,worth the money for sure would buy any Onkyo product any time very high quility for the money move over sony you got company
2,EXCELLENT,"THIS HAS BEEN GREAT. IT PLAYS WELL AND IS EASY TO OPERATE. I COULD NOT FIND ONE IN TOWN, SO THIS REALLY HELPED."
1,Look elsewhere,"The other morning, the unit suddenly came on by itself. No surge -- nothing else was effected, the lights didn't even dim. Came on, but won't function by either the remote or the buttons on the face of the unit. Gone. Should have paid attention to all the poor reviews. A little under a year old. Heck, I've had off brand units last for five years..."
1,Very Disappointed,"Worked great when first connected to receiver / speakers. Then it just stopped working. Couldn't even remove my CD's that were inside. Amazon refunded my money, (minus shipping and restocking fees). I only had it for 5 months."
1,quality control,save your money folks. this one aint nothing but a paperweight. very poor quality control. only good thing is I'm returning within 30 days so I can get my money refunded.
1,Don't Listen to it more than once.,"The first time I put this CD into the Discman, I was feelin it. The album was pretty hot. Than I heard it again. The beats are tight, but Bone sounds like Popeye. They gotta slow down the flow."
2,resurect E.1999,"Dear Mr. Ougi, There has never been a group that could flow like Bone. Eazy got it right when he put those guys together. All thuggish Bone fans will love this album. It makes the art of war look like Britaney Spears (with the exeption of ""Thug Love""). I am sorry, but I just dont think it compares with E. 1999 NOTHING EVER WILL! Thats why I gave it a 4!"
1,THEY MIGHT NEVER LIVE UP TO E.1999 ETERNAL,"With this new album, I was expecting Bone to go back to the lyrics of E.1999 Eternal(A classic, one of the best rap albums). Unfortunately, like Art of War, the songs that are good can be counted with less than all my fingers. Each album after e.1999 has fallen short of it. This album is alright but too many slow songs, SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM BONE. Their gangsta style is what got everyone, and Easy-E, on their new redifining rap flows. After the Crossroads, their songs turned more pop for money. 2 Stars cause there is much better stuff out there right now like Chronic 2001, Alkaholiks, etc."
2,2nd in a terrific family saga series,"It's not easy to find this book anymore - I got it at my library but had to special-order it from another branch. The series has two different numbering systems - one by order written, one by order of events. In the order of events, this is the 2nd in events, following The Building of Jalna. I wasn't crazy about the opening, but the story really picked up after that and is a delightful mix of humor and drama. If you like family sagas, then you'll enjoy the Whiteoaks series. I especially enjoyed the children in the story (Ernest's 'my eye' comments really become comical). I plan to read the whole series."
1,The worst creatures in the world.,"Yuck! How can they do that, so incredible and disgrace. I've never heard this kind of songs before. And they call it songs? And their looks, oh gosh, some black hair, some blond hair, what are they doing? Their look is soooooooooo disgusting. And make me want to vomit too. How can u guys have such bad taste? Really make me wonder, they must be God's mistake. PITY."
2,Magnetic to children,"This is the first time I have purchased Raffi in CD format. I have bought many tape copies over the years as gifts for many children. I have travelled by car all over the North American continent with my own children and this music made the trips fun. It was the only music we still played after a trip! I feel like the music helps them put feelings and thoughts into contexts that they can understand. It also entertains the adults. After once through the songs, you will be humming along, after three times through you will be making up verses. Highly Recommended!"
2,Great Head Unit,"Pioneer makes some great auto head units and this is no exception, The unit works and functions flawlessly and looks great. Very simple to operate and there is not a clutter of buttons to add confusion. The USB port is a very handy thing to have but I found that it did not function well when playing music from a jump drive, I think because of the different formats, it locked up and stopped playing. My Ipod worked without any problems at all and was easy to control from the unit. I really think Pioneer makes the Best auto stereo for the money."
2,Excellent,This was the best and perhaps the most slow books of the series but I absolutely loved it? Who IS Taran?
2,"An excellent and heartfelt story, though not my favorite","This is probably my least favorite of the Prydain Chronicles. Don't get me wrong though, I liked it, just not as much as the others. I thought it moved slower than the others, and also Eilonwy was left out of the book, and she was always the highlight for me. Anyway, the basic plot of the book was that Taran at last cannot stand not knowing who his parants were, so he goes on a personal quest to try discover his identity. He hopes to find out he is from noble birth because then he can marry Eilonwy, but what he finds isn't exactly what he thought... So, in general this was a great book that asks the ultimate moral question and deals with the truth that it isn't who your parants are the make you you. This is an excellent series that I would recommend to anyone, though it would make more sense if you had read the previous four first."
2,A Children's Classic,"Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo, Sleeping Beauty pits good against evil, and good wins. Intricate background scenery, silly fairies, and wonderful singing highlight this classic fairy tale. Is it a realistic picture of life as a medieval princess? Of course not. It's not supposed to be."
2,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Thank you for replacing the movie that you sent me with a brand new MILLION time better copy of it! was a great package to come home to! it made my daughters day
2,Disney's Sleeping Beauty on Blu-Ray,"History repeats itself! ""Sleeping Beauty"" was the first animated Disney film to be released on VHS tape (*many* moons ago), so it makes perfect sense that it would be their first animated film to be released on Blu-Ray. I can hardly wait! I have always loved the distinctive artwork (kudos to the late-great Eyvind Earle) and the villianess that is Maleficent (voiced by the same actress as the Evil Stepmother in ""Cinderella""). And knowing that it was originally made in wide screen format, it will certainly be a feast for the eyes on Blu-Ray!"
2,Sleeping Beauty,What a wonderful movie. Reminded me of watching when I was a kid and so happy to have found it again for my kids.
1,Okay Film - Poor Extras,"This was sneaked out onto release on region 2 disc ages ago in England (minus commentary). Although the film is visually stunning and has some nice set pieces it lacks warmth and, with some small exceptions, has no compelling characters. The extras are as dry as sticks and smack of the pompous. If you want a special edition Disney disc stick to 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast'."
1,Beware! Digital flaw,"Everything about this release is wonderful except that it has a manufacture digital flaw. Both our original and replacement had the exact same digital flaw, in the exact same location. Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first."
2,the most amazing masterpiece of animation ......ever/,"i can only say ,that this movie meant so much to me as a child ,growing up in ROME ,my mother used to draw me the characters from the movie ,while playing the beautiful music ,at the piano,this movie got me interested in drawing and painting,,if this movie is ever made into a regular feature film ,the actress to play MALEFICENT hAs got to be ,the singer SIOUXSIE SIOUX,she has the voice ,and the sinister ,and yet powerful allure ,to keep the movie going...thanks disney ,for creating a wonderful MOVIE for generations to enjoy....machi"
2,Sleeping,I love this movie. It's one of my favorite earlier Disney films. I love all of the colors and the music. I personally think that this is one of Disney's better Fairy Tale adaptation. The movie just really flowed well with every thing.
2,sleeping beauty,It was so easy to order and the product came earlier that I thought. My greatgrandaughter was so delighted it was in excellent shape and the process was effertless. I have since order other products from Amazom. thank you for excellect service.
2,Wonderful Film. Excellent Extras.,"ALL of the short film Extras are on the Second Disk. If you want any Extras, be very careful to order the TWO Disk Set.Here are some of The EXTRAS on Disk TWO...""Disneyland"" (1954), Once Upon a Dream: The Making of Walt Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' (1997) (V), Grand Canyon (1958), 4 Artists Paint 1 Tree: A Walt Disney 'Adventure in Art' (1958)"
1,Disappointed...,"I was more than thrilled to pay the $70 dollars to own this timeless classic, as it is one of my faves.The reason why I didn't rate my purchase 5 stars are for a few reasons. First it arrived a day later than what I was was predicted. I didn't think too much of it, however, the problem was it arrived with scuffs and scratches on the plastic housing the cover art. The case had a crack on the upper corner of the blu ray case. I was under the impression that I would be receiving something that looks new as it was deemed on the packaging. It was also just the blu ray case with the dvd sleeve taped over the case. Was it not supposed to be in some sort of box-set? Overall, I love this movie but I'm extremely disappointed at the condition the film arrived in. I feel as though I paid more money for something that may not have been as much as I spent. Oh well..."
2,Excellent Buy!,Made my first batch this morning. I added bananas and pecans. Excellent! I highly recommend this mix if you are in the market for a gluten free muffin mix.
2,Gluten free mix,Kids and I love this. Texture is great. We use it to make scones and kids ask for it all the time.
2,"I'm no R&B fan, but you gotta hear this!!","I'm a major Talking Heads fan and some years ago I heard these guys do the final track featuring 'Once in a Lifetime' and had to get it. To my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed most of the CD. The vocals are so smooth you too will take notice! A sample of the intro of tracks won't do the CD justice as many need to build a bit. It also wouldn't hurt to be somewhat spritual as many songs reference the faith, but don't let the 'Christian R&B' thing bug you. This is just good music."
1,Deceptively surprising,"The many good customer reviews encouraged me to buy this book, with one eye pointing at women stories and one pointing at knowledge of other cultures and different realities. Although the book is well written and the story engaging, its placement in the desert seems arbitrary and not faithfull to geographical and gender reality = I did not learn anything new about the desert and Islam, nor about women. It was a nice, easy to consume fuilleton."
2,agama tantra : my hands and yours,This is the most helpful tool I have encounterd for use in prayer.The illustrations are very exact and obviously extremely well studied. Kleen's texts are invaluable to the western practitioner of agama hindu bali(Agama Tirtha).
1,Just Dang Perplexing,"I have a deep and abiding respect for blacks, black culture, and the need to continue the important struggle for equal rights. The great civil rights icons are my heart-felt heros.This is why it makes me wonder drop-jawed, when I see so much of black America (it seems) embrace some clever gang member, who can couch his utter nonsense in some cute rhymes, dip & bop on stage, and then get glamorized and idolized. I see no value in his work because there is no value.It makes blacks look dumb, and they are NOT dumb."
2,Donald Goines-Excellent Writer,I read this book when I was 13 years old. I was so impressed with this book that I read his entire collection of writings.I am now an adult and have encouraged my teenage children to read them as well.All of his writings are highly recommended. It will make you cry and laugh and I guarantee that you will not be able to put them down.
2,Hubba hubba hot stuff,"So Mars needs men to repopulate? If they all look like this babe, sign me up! She's tall, sexy, and cold as ice. This may be the first and only sci-fi movie centralized around a female alien dominetrex. Talk about hot. She could melt the polar ice caps just walking by.Her robot companion is nothing much more than a huge walking box. Maybe the movie went broke after the dazzling special effects they used inside the space ship.The movie is pretty entertaining and creepy in a strange way. It's not my favorite Atomic Age movie, but if you enjoy 50's Sci-Fi, you need this in your collection."
1,Devil Girl * a very Bad copy,"This isn't really a review of the movie but rather a review of the video sent out. My copy was so bad (just simply too dark) I could not see any the player in the scene. I would guess it just over copied, as besides dark hard edges in the movie (like walls of a building) were wavy. I returned the DVD and got a full refund. I will continue looking for a better copy."
2,Nearly perfect example of the genre!!,"That is, cheesy '50s sci-fi flicks featuring women in skimpy outfits. This has pretty much everything the disbelieving guy, the sexy alien who underestimates us earth folk, the other girl that also falls for the disbelieving guy; the older couple, and the kindly boss. Everythng, that is, except a logical plot, and who needs that? Buy this right now!!"
2,A high quality album for lovers of good soul music,"'Sleep Talk' and 'My love is so raw' are the stand out dance tracks for the more energetic among you, while the lovers would like 'Just Call My Name ' and 'I Need Your Lovin' for chilling out to."
1,take it from me,this suction cup did not work at all i was very disappointeda waste of money on the dent i was using it for i put the suction cup on it and started pulling but the dent didnt go any where you could tell that it was tryna work but it didnt
1,A time to kill,"This is not a full sized book. It was a little more worn than what was noted. I did received it before the arrival date and I would order from this company again, but I will make sure the book is a regular sized book and not a book club sized book."
1,Came Bent,"I was excited to get this to put on the wall in my playroom for magnets for the kids. But the item came bent so i had to send it back. I know that what I wanted to use it for was not the intended use for this item, but I imagine it would need to not be bent for most usage."
1,sorry.......,"i have to say that i am sorry for letting this go on this long...you see, i bought this set through amazon based on it's 5 star rating about a year ago and i feel that it is my duty as a person with good taste in dance and trance music to say that it SUCKS! don't make the mistake i made. i'm talking boring mixing, decent tracks. i don't think that there is one moment on these two cd's that there are actually two tracks playing at the same time. of course, i haven't listened to it in several months now... actually, i think i gave it away."
2,longer version,"this book is packed with info.. it's the longer version of ""a brief history"" and how your prof. has so much info..that's not showing up in your shorter text (if you're getting the brief version) it has a lot of pics..and maps..and is easy to read.. very informative ..text book"
2,FIRST MP3,"The screen is very nice and easy to view, even in bright sunlight. I was able to load songs with no trouble, and sound quality is pretty good. Only negative is that you must use a USB hookup to charge it."
2,Its what I wanted!,"I am very pleased, compatible with windows vista, (was worried) and as far as battery usage, I walk on my treadmill for 40 mins and I usually don't have a bar missing from the battery for atleast 3 uses, not to mention the battery has 3 bars. Very lightweight and user friendly. Will buy another for my boyfriend."
1,Where Eagles Dare,"Did not like this movie. It might have some juvenile appeal but certainly not for someone in touch with reality. lol,lol,lol!"
2,Broadsword calling Danny Boy...,"Clint and Richard in the perfect movie to watch on xmas day! Great script, excellent dialog and some very nice set pieces.When is this thing coming out on DVD!"
2,A great movie about how the Americans outfoxed the Germans,"The movie was well made and how the Americans thought that they had captured the right person, instead they were mistaken."
1,Monotone,"Great movie, unfortunatly it only plays in monotone not stereo Dolby like it says on the case. I played it on 3 different DVD players with the same result. Rather distracting."
1,Messy Air,"It starts off pretty well, then decides it doesn't want to be a Mash type of film but wants to be a big buddy buddy action flick. Yet it's not that either.It winds up being a mess of uninspired satire, that has Mel Gibson spouting off a series of trying too hard to be funny one liners .The story is about the CIA's secret drug smuggling for cooperation and arms in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. It can never decide if it's just a glib buddy buddy action film or satire with an edge and winds up being a crass over-produced failure. Robert Downey Jr. is enjoyable for a while but no one is given anything resembling a real character to play. And the parade of stereotypical characters, ethnic insults and missed opportunities becomes numbing after a while.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder Available End of January 2001...."
2,Expensive,"A valuable book in this field. Better and fuller text than most Quimper books. Along with the average color photos, there is a broad and useful appendix of many small b&w photos. A good addition to any faience library, but -- it is too expensive, even through Amazon.com! Publisher, get real!"
1,Inexpensive but be careful,"The previous reviews are all correct. Inexpensive, silent and easy to load watches. However, I have had this unit overwind two watches. These are $200 Japan automatic movements so I wasn't very happy. Might be better on a swiss movement, but why would you want to risk a more expensive watch on this winder."
2,For once a product worth more than cost,"I have seen fancier watch winders made from elegant wood and perhaps of finer craftsmanship which are offered at costs for a double winder (which this is) starting at multiples of the cost of this product. I have had the item for two weeks and it is a fantastic value. It offers settings to wind both clockwise and counter-clockwise and an on/off switch which I shut off at night.It also winds for one hour and rests for three. A whole lot of features and great bang for the buck!! I keep it in an unobtrusive place and it is surprsingly quiet. The vendor (AA Store) provided outstanding service and I am hard-pressed to imagine any buyer of this winder not being delighted with it. Even the finest timepiece (I only own a watch) would not object to a home in this winder...perhaps not elegant, but certainly functional and cost-efficient."
1,Very loud!,I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!! We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.
1,I would not buy it again,"At first, I thought this was a pretty good deal. I figured I could tolerate the somewhat cheap, plastic appearance because of the favorable price. However, the winder lasted only six months before dying. At a rate of two per year, the price starts to look a lot less favorable!"
2,The hit of Xmas - why did I wait so long?,Since a kid I've wanted one of these - put them in my grandchildren's stockings - what a hit! What a cool call! Simple but effective - I will now finally order one for myself!
2,Feeling Mellow,"This is a great CD when you're feeling mellow or slightly sad. Nonetheless, the lyrics still have bite, which keeps it one step above the rest. It doesn't push, but is very subtle and understated. For this reason it lives on as a classic, after all the other fads of music have passed on by. You have to hear it."
1,Urgh! Ruined by an Americanisation!,"This book is beautifully illustrated, however it is RUINED by the fact that the wombat at the end calls his Mum ""Mom"" (it would get 5 stars otherwise, the Wombat is my favourite ""native""). If you're going to write a book on an Australian native mammal, at least give it a sense of authenticity and an Australian ""accent"". I picked it up at a local bookshop and almost flung it out of my hands when I saw that."
1,HELL NO NOBODY TAKES THE NAME FROM 2PAC,"nobody takes the light out of tupac and sais all eyes on us....First of all, 50cent is a wannabe, he has no skill, no lyrics he just tries to act tough and his music is boring and he throws on heavy beats and tries to beef with everyone to get credibility but he is overrated because the rap world is so weak today. DONT BUY THIS instead get something real before these guys rapped about money cash hoes"
1,WTMI,I found The Devils Highway nearly impossible to slog through. Not to make light of the level of human suffering the author was attempting to expose but I found it repetitive and exasperating. The author felt it necessary to wallow in the details and belabor the point by taking each individual involved and describe their role in the account or suffering separately and in meticulous detail. I wanted to shout at the author “I got it already” now get on with the story or as my daughter is fond of saying “WTMI” (Way too much information)
2,Outstanding,I reside in Texas and have personal knowledge of the immigration situation from a different view than that reflected in the book. It very much humanizes this situation and makes one aware that these are real people with families and a history.
2,A third novel that surpasses its predecessors.,"Hugh Holton is a Chicago police officer who uses a vivid imaginationand a good sense of story telling to weave some prettydifferent mysteries set in a realistic Chicago background.While it is generally helpful to have read Presumed Dead andWindy City, it is not a requirement.One of the most intriguing characters on the side of law and order isthe Master of Deception and Disguise. Read the book and seewhat I mean.Larry Cole is truly at his best in this book. I look forwardto reading Hugh's next."
2,I have really entered the dru.,"Since the day my girlfriend introduced this group to me, my heart has never been the same. It has ""given me one more reason"" to love her the more. Sisquo is really talented. Woody has real soul. Nokio is the man and Jazz be fine. I can hardly wait for a new release from these guys. Let's hear it for dru hill. Drufans show them more love. Psst whatever happened to their official website?"
2,"Don't Sleep On This Album, I'm telling YOU!","I wish I would've taken my own advice earlier, cuz that's exactly what I did at first. And I regret ever doing that! I used to listen to only 2 songs ""These Are the Times"" & ""The Love we had"" But, NOW the whole CD is GOOD! So, for those few bad reviews that were written. I know how you may listen to a CD and it might not catch your interest at first, but you have to atleast listen to a CD 3 to 4 times to really feel it. This CD has some really funky soulful songs like #2,#3, #6, #7 and some really romantic ballads! My favs are ""I'll be the One"" & ""Everything"" DRU HILL I really wish y'all the best, because this CD is the BOMB!"
2,THiS iS mY FaVoRiTe CD Of aLL TiMe!!,"Dru Hill definetly did it again.. These 4 men are ASTOUNDING! I love them! They are so amazingly talented!! I've had this CD since it came out in '98 and it hasn't moved from my CD player! This album is AWESOME! Anyone who hasn't bought it, you are missing out on the best CD ever.. I'm not exaggerating at all. All of my friends seem to agree also because everyone who has it (which is just about everyone!) simply adores it just like i do! So y'all gotta go out and buy it if you haven't already!!"
2,It was off tha hizzie shizzie,This cd was really good. It was just amazing! And of course they are too. All of them! Anyone who does not have this cd needs to go out and get it. I am glad that I bought it.
2,lightweight and it works,If you are looking for a lightweight trimmer this is the one. It is a good length and it is one of the handiest garden tools I have. Highly recommend.
2,Best I've Found So Far,"My four year old son will sit and watch this even though he insists he does not want to learn Chinese and prefers to watch cartoons. It moves pretty slowly, but it does have entertaining features, such as real animal photos, funny masks, and video of kids playing on the beach. The speakers are not native, but they seem to be taking care to speak clearly and use correct inflections. There is a decent amount of repetition. Even though my son refuses to repeat any of the words, I think it is training his ear to pick up Chinese more easily later. I find the pin ying subtitles helpful and wish they were provided throughout, instead of just the first time each word is introduced and during the recap at the end."
2,a six star album,"Weezy, congrats!! The uncrowned king of the rap game, seriously !!! Dawg , I wasn't a fan of the breakup, I still don't agree, but time changes ,so do people. You were the bigger person to make a record about your feelings about your dawgs, instead of riding on the other Hot Boys, you kept it trill. Mannie you cut the buck on this beesh. Hot as fizzuck, the best Cash Money album of all time. A sure Grammy !! Weezy if you top this you one, I am going to campaign to call it Wayne's World . Man, I aint riding your sack, but dawg you are just flawless my n*gga . Jada got a pretty good album, but yours will be the album of the summer ,fall and so on. Maybe you can do a collabo with Dirty out Montgomery !!! Mannie did and it was scorchin' ! Well done whoadie !!!"
1,Best rapper alive? HAHAHAHAHAHA,"Yea dont make me laugh, best rapper alive?? Yea f*cking right! First of all cash money is THE stupidest name for a rap group ever, even though it does accurately describe the greed and ignorance it spreads like a wildfire through its music. Though i hav to admit Lil Wayne IS the best rapper in cash money (which really doesnt say anything at all when u look at the competition). His lyrics are all about the 4 big things in commercial rap these days, (money, cars, women and jewlery). Man if Tupac, Big L and Biggie were still alive there wouldnt be clowns like this around. If you want to know the REAL best hip hop albums of '04 pick up Madvillainy, 4th Dimensional Rocketship Going Up, Viktor Vaughn 2 and Murs 3:16.(Oh yea, and please click the ""not helpful"" button so i have an accurate count of the number of mainstream loving retards that read this, thanks)."
2,I love Lil Wayne,I think Lil Wayne is one of the best rappers alive.I haven't been a big fan of Lil Wayne until I heard him with Young Money now I love everything about him.All of his albums are the bomb including this one.Anyone who doesn't love his flow and his style is a hater.Lil Wayne keep doin it big don't let these haters slow u down.
2,Lil Wayne beats all of his other albums,Think about it...if birman and mannie fresh put alot of work in this album it's got to be great. The problem is it's not an album that you can listen to over and over again.
1,Lil Wayne is a Lil Wack!,"this guy is a pathetic excuse for a rapper, i dislike lil wayne alot and he cant rap and he is no good n his face is really just there for u 2 knock him out. this guy sux and i cant believe he is famous and selling records, its embarrassing and i hate him very much, his album would be just as bad as himself.----------- DO NOT SUPPORT LIL WAYNE ---------------"
2,Didn't expect to find this classic,"This game is a diamond. Fun, challenging, exciting, and enjoyable to :) This is a DOS game from the pre Windows 95 era, but with hi resolution and 256 color support I believe it still holds it's ground today."
1,Looks Tough,"Looks are deceiving. I haven't taken this item out on any serious adventure yet but out of the box it feels rather flimsy. The light in the back that swivels is tough to maneuver and I think it will probably break off sometime. The front light is kind of dim. The radio and flasher are OK. Everything works as supposed to, I just wish I shopped around before I picked this one up."
2,A worthwhile investment!,"I have to disagree with the prior review of this album. Yes, its late period Wynton not long before he died, BUT, the album contains some spirited swinging trio music that certainly agrees with my ears! Tunes like Scufflin' and Dontcha hear me callin to ya are are simple but infectious grooves equal to any of Wynton's earlier trio efforts. I will admit that Walk on By isnt exactly all that inspiring, but on the whole this is a decent performance from a cohesive group of star performers. Its not the greatest jazz trio disc around, but its sits nicely in my collection as one of only a handful of readily available CD's that Wynton made under his own name."
2,A Great Season - A Limited DVD,"SciFi 's (hereafter 'Skiffy') quixotic post-cancellation rerun schedule has forced die-hard ""Farscape"" fans to invest in sets of DVDs. Unfortunately, the kind of static, text-only ""extras"" ADV includes do little justice to the series. Rumor has it that the fans have been heard and Season Three's set has significantly improved.Having said that, the move by Skiffy executives to scuttle the show after Season Four's cliffhanger is made more incomprehensible with each viewing of the previous seasons. Even the minor episodes contain multi-faceted character development - most startling in Henson Creature Shop's Rygel - and layered writing. In spite of the flaws in ADV's presentation, this set is well worth owning - and certainly provides a more convenient viewing atmosphere than the present midnight rerun madness."
1,Yawner,"The DVD is great in quality for picture and sound. The CD does not have near as good quality. There are no suprises here and a live cd should not be made by Coldplay...why? because the songs are the exact same as they are on the album. All of their songs follow the same structure, same chord progression, same repetative beat. Yellow is to Politik as The Scientist is to Amsterdam. The worst song on the album would have to be In My Place, where he clearly doesn't want to sing the chorus because he probably is scared of going flat and allows the crowd to do it for him. The song is not as powerful as it is on the album. Just buy a Rush of Blood to the Head and you'll be more satisfied. A reviewer referenced Oasis copying the Beatles...well Coldplay copies U2."
1,You have got to be kidding me!,"I loved Coldplay's other two albums, but I have never heard such crap! I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money. He sings out of tune and can't harmonize for crap! Five stars come on people...rate the CD not the Band!"
1,DVD Problem,"The rate would be a good 4,5... but the DVD doesn't play in Europe... So don't buy it if not American... otherwise music is neat, enjoy it, America.Marko Smolej, Slovenia"
2,"EXCELENT DVD, BUT SOME OF THEIR BEST SONGS WERE FORGOTTEN","First I want to say that when I say ""some of their best songs"" I'm refering to some of my favorite coldplay songs like ""Green Eyes"", ""Warning Sign"", ""Brothers and sisters"", ""Easy to please"", ""Spies"" and ""We never change"". But don't worry all Coldplay hits are in here like ""Clocks"", ""Yellow"", ""The scientist"", ""in my place"",etc.The performance of Coldplay on stage is totally awesome and the documentary is interesting. This DVD is very close to be PERFECT but the fact that some of my favorite coldplay songs are missing makes me stay waiting for another coldplay DVD.Check out the new songs theyre really goodIf you like Parachutes and a Rush of blood to the head go buy itAlso listen to some travis wich is with coldplay my two favorite British bands."
2,1 of Da BEST Hip Hop Albumz Eva!!!,"This album is 1 of the best Hip Hop albums ive listened to in awhile, its really cool & catchy. You have heard some of the songs from Tony Hawks 4 but anyway this album was a bit hard to find but i got it, its so wicked (NOTE: Chad Muska only producers the beats he doesnt perform)1.

2,EXCELLENT,"These boys are having their best year ever! After putting out Necroshine(5 stars, best metal album of the year,1999) earlier this year, the band releases a 12 pack of cover tunes. With my faith restored in this band after Necroshine, Overkill rip n' tear into all these songs. Personal favorites being Purple's Space Truckin', Motorhead's Overkill, Kiss' Deuce, Manowar's Death Tone, and the Ramones I'm Against It. But all the songs are good, and this band is ready and headed for a re-birth to the top of the metal scene."
2,"Incredible healthy, great tasting meals","I own both the High Fit - Low Fat cookbooks (regular and vegetarian). The books are good for both novice and experienced chefs. Using these cookbooks, I have learned how to eat incredibly healthy while serving really tasty meals! The Eggplant Parmesan recipe is now a requirement for potlucks I attend. I love it because it is so easy to make. The cookbooks make great gifts too, I bought 10 as gifts for family members. Although I own many cookbooks, I do the majority of my cooking from the High Fit - Low Fat recipes."
2,Combat lighting,This light was highly rated here and on Youtube! I use it on my Mossberg 12 ga thunder ranch shotgun. It's very light in weight and great in a home defense situation.
2,"Excellent flashlight. I strapped one to mod 22 glock 22 handgun, and the other is on my ar-14, yankee hill carbine rifle.","This flashlight is very good.Beam brightness and focus is great. Also, the flip switch works great for rifle or handgun."
1,Out-of-print for a reason!,"The premise of this book, written by an ad agency exec, is that corporate clients are clueless morons who just don't realize what geniuses their ad agency guys are. Marconi's answer to ""Getting The Best From Your Ad Agency""? Throw a lot of money their way, question nothing, and worship the results. The book is poorly edited with numerous typos, sequencing errors, etc. It also contains outrageous amounts of filler material - a 3 and 1/2 page list of celebrity endorsers and their products, 7 pages of ad slogans going back decades - as well as self-serving examples of ""successful"" vs. ""unsuccessful"" ad campaigns (hmm, let me guess whose Chicago based ad agency produced the much lauded campaign for the Chicago Board of Trade.) Waste no time, effort or money tracking this one down."
2,Building with Nature--Review,This is a very important reexamination of the American origins of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the major contibutions of a small group of Bay Area designers. The central role is occupied by the Reverend Joseph Worcester who created one of the true landmarks of the movement with the Church of the New Jerusalem in San Francisco. The author provides new context and a great amount of new reseach. This book is a major accomplishment.
1,Am police and religons expert: it is inaccurate.,"Having served as expert witness in comparative religions, and in pyschology, as associate professor at a state college, and as police officer, my opinion of this book is it is not worth reading twice. It is highly inaccurate and biased. It overlooks the proven cases of criminal satanic practice, such as Matamoros Mex, (Palo Maiombre). It agrues from silence. It is just an attempt to make a buck by telling people what they want to hear, religios crimes do not exist, or at least are not a serious threat. Too bad he does not know what he is talking aboiut"
2,Steve Perry is AMAZING!,LOVVVVVEEE this cd. Steve Perry is outstanding. His vocal range is truly one of a kind and cannot be duplicated. Great music!!!!!
2,Love ol Jerry Lee,"Being in my teens in the 50's , I loved Jerry Lee and Elvis but as I have gotten older I like the slower songs and this CD suits me just fine. I have a lot of 8 track of Jerry Lee and then I bought cassettes and now I'm buying his CD's. I was fortunate enought to see him in person twice and he was great both times.He's a talent and a showman."
1,Tedious!,Maxwell's writing is enjoyable but the restraint of his characters makes the story very slow-moving and boring. Reading this book was a chore
2,Ultra-heavy techno-metal with evil fury,"I love this cd. I found out about this little known band thru an industrial website link...I'm glad I kept track with the band and got this cd. The best songs are Cannibal:Burn, Newthead, Scream Johnny Scream, and Twisting and Turning...highly processed vocals but they sound good and evil with buzzsaw guitars and keyboards everywhere. Buy this cd if you like industrial...heavy! This band toured with the likes of 16 volt, Acumen Nation, Clay People, Chemlab...stuff like that. good cd...band broke up. might as well buy their one perfect good cd."
2,A Good Collection Of Cindy Morgan's Music,"I remember a couple of my favorite Cindy Morgan songs that did not make this collection: ""Love Will Break Your Fall"" and ""Reason To Live"". Are there any songs out of these 14 that should be taken off to make room for one of these two? Not really. That means this is a good collection.Besides the two I mentioned, this collection also has these other personal favorites: ""Sweet Days Of Grace"", ""How Can I Ask For More"", ""Real Life"", ""Listen"", ""Let It Be Love"", and ""I Will Be Free""."
2,Her Best is as Good as Anybody Else!!,"While from album to album, Cindy Morgan's songs can be inconsistent (especially on her first two CDs), when she hit her stride with LISTEN and UNDER THE WATERFALL, in particular, and THE LOVING KIND (which got majorly overlooked), she is as good as anybody else out there. This is truly an exceptional collection. When Cindy Morgan is good, she is really, really good: ""Sweet Days of Grace,"" ""How Could I Ask for More,"" ""I Will Be Free"" (for my Grammie W. . .), ""Listen,"" ""I'll Stand,"" ""Praise the King"" & ""Take My Life,"" for starters. The two new tracks are great, too--I love her take on ""Love is the Answer."" Her best is as good as anybody out there in Contemporary Christian music, and this is a superb collection of those top shelf songs. Not sure I would have added much or left off much. No fluff, no filler--just her best!"
1,A bitter disappointment,"This Mellencamp album stunk even more badly than Whenever We Wanted. Like another reviewer here said, the only worthwhile songs on this album are ""Key West Intermezzo"" and ""Just Another Day,"" and even they are nothing compared to JM's other work.If you are not that familiar with Mellencamp, do yourself a favor and get an album like Big Daddy or The Lonesome Jubilee to see what greatness he's capable of. I wasted my money on this sorry collection of third-rate material."
2,10 Stars,"On the edge of your seat excitement, great acting, great plot, wonderful ending. Just loved it. Mos Def is an astonishingly great actor. Don't know a thing about his rap music, but have seen him in several films, including ""Something the Lord Made"", and give him two thumbs up for being able to act like a pro.This is a true thriller - bad cops, bad cop turned good, petty criminal who wants to change, car chases, crowded NY streets, and everything in between.Give it a try and ignore the critics."
2,great movie,"This is a great movie to watch. If you like happy endings, don't watch the alternate ending, it sucks....(just didn't like how it ended) I like happy endings"
2,Good story line,"Starts a little slow, but I'm glad I kept watching. It was a different story line and for once Bruce Willis isn't wearing a 'white hat', more of a gray hat. He's not the good guy, but ends up doing the right thing. Good story line with complicated twists in the plot.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Terrible movie a waste of 2 hours,"If your into an endless chase movie without any real plot or substance than this movie is for you. The movie runs forever without any fluidity to the storyline. Bruce willies, an over the hill detective, is forced to chose whether his going to line up with his old squad and eliminate a witness that is about to bring a lot of ""good guys "" from Willis's old squad or whether he is going to do the right thing and bring the witness to court so he can testify against the corrupted cops. Well the choice is obvious and from there the never-ending chase begins. Overall just a terrible movie. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this one. Edan Aharony."
1,Be prepared for a warped movie,"The back of the DVD case called the movie a ""wickedly funny"" tale. Not true at all. It is one of those very warped movies, true or not, that makes you feel sick to your stomach. I tend to like the more unusual, moving films, but this is over the line. Reminds me of the Squid and the Whale. I feel very sorry for the author if this truly is based on his life."
1,"Great cast, but missing the dark humor of the book","I had high expectations for this movie - I had read the book and knew that the cast had great potential. The actors were great in portraying their roles - from Annette Bening as the eccentric mother to Gwenyth Paltrow as the obedient daughter, but the plot of the movie missed the biting dark humor that had put the novel in the top 10 of my collection. I'm afraid that, if I had seen the movie before reading the book, I might not have read the book."
2,"True Story, Huh?","Running With ScissorsWhat a movie based on a autobiographical account of the movies main character Augustin. His life is to say the least dysfunctional. He makes it through the with the help of a crazy yet meaningful family of loons that are actually quite lovable. To suffice, the movie is a must see because the acting is outstanding with a great ensemble cast including Annette Benning, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow and the lead whose name escapes me right now. This movie is a must see!!"
1,"Not a comedy, just strange","If you want to watch a depressing movie about a crazy family then this is the movie for you. Yes, anyone who can survive this is truly remarkable but was marketed wrong as a comedy. I found nothing funny about it. The acting was good, but not what I expected."
1,Running With Scissors,"Polarizing performance by Annette Benning. Great cast that followed the story-line as true to the acclaimed novel as possible. An abstract story, entertaining in nature but drags its feet."
1,What A Mess!,"Like others, I decided to see ""Running With Scissors"" based on a trailer I saw that presented it as a dark, eccentric comedy. The cast looked more than promising, and I love quirky movies, but I shut this one off after watching an hour of venom-filled yelling and swearing. It's very unusual for me to not watch a film in its entirety, but I felt I was completely wasting my time and turned it off. I didn't like any of the characters, although I felt some degree of sympathy for the boy (not enough to see how he fared, however). This was the most disappointing film I've seen in a very long time."
1,Sorry,"While this review won't be very detailed, I think the point will be quite clear:read the book, skip the movie."
2,Amazing,"This game is amazing. It takes an incredible amount of strategy and skill. There are always decisions to be made. Buy it, you will love it."
2,Excellent for the price!,This an excellent comforter for the price! The down pockets are evenly spaced and plumply filled but the down still moves around a bit between squares and it takes a lot of time to wiggle the down back into the center of the comforter. The feather pillows that came free with this in November took nearly 3 months to arrive. The cover is soft and the comforter is very comfortable.
1,BEWARE Cut Version!,"I sold this DVD version of Wayne's Alamo on Ebay after I watched the CUT documentary. And where was the documentary cut at? All the interviews with the Mexican actors, or participants of the film were deleted from it!!!! When I watched it a few years ago, I noticed something wrong with it, and I soon realized the parts where the Mexicans were interviewed were cut out of the documentary! A trip, indeed. This is a piece of crappola, and MGM s/be ashamed of itself....but, knowing its past history, I know it isn't ashamed of itself in this racist cut of a documentary! It just wasn't the same without those Mexican participants somehow! It was lacking spirit because of their slanted cut of those Mexican participants in the film, shame on you MGM!!!"
2,great movie,The Duke's Alamo is a fine film. So is Walt Disney's Davy Crockett and the 2004 Alamo with Billy Bob Thorton as a fine Davy Crockett. You can't beat all of these for excellent historical adventures.
1,The Alamo with John Wayne,"Having seen the wide-screen version, this video was very disappointing. I expected the same movie. I couldn't even sit through the first hour because they kept on cutting out parts that I remember from the full-length wide-screen version. Very disappointing considering you can't return videos that are viewed."
1,To Commit Treason...,"If I may commit treason in the eyes of all John Wayne fans--this was NOT the movie for him! Most of his roles (most notably ""True Grit"") he just fits into, as though they were written with him in mind (and most probably were). This one just doesn't work for him. John Wayne is NOT Davy Crockett; he just says the lines and valiantly dies when the script says the time is right."
2,Great Film!,"The Alamo is a masterpiece from John Wayne. Any controversy over this film is overblown and outdated. Who really paid for the keg of Corn Liquor that got blown up by the cannonball, Chill Wills or Davy Crockett? Did Davy sleep with the senora?"
1,"Honor, courage, duty, hokum","Now that the cold war is over, America should take a cold shower and re-examine this fascinating (if overblown) episode in its history and once more dare to interpret it (perhaps even objectively) for the silver screen. John Wayne's embarassing rendering ages badly - unless, of course, you are a John Wayne fan. Wayne is less interested in history than in a make-believe story of what he thinks history is. As a proud liberal and American I will state it loud and clear: This movie is junk."
1,Not the Director's Version,"I want to warn others not to make the mistake I did. This is not that beautiful director's cut which was issued on Laser and VHS. If that is what you are looking for, WAIT.I am completely in awe why the studio would release the trimmed down version of this film on DVD!Please please release the 202 minute version."
1,Do Not Recommend,"Unfortunately is stopped working a month or so after I bought it at Target. I called the manufacturer and was told to send it to the repair center at my cost and wait 6 -8 weeks until they fix it and return it to me. Very poor customer service too, the technical support rep took a very long time getting my name, address, proceeded to spell my name military style several times...."
2,hard swingin,"Everyone is taking long, energetic solos in front of a lively crowd. Johnny Griffin wails on his tenor sax. Roy Eldridge creates some amazing sounds on his trumpet. Bassist Niels Henning Orsted Pedersen swings as hard ever and takes amzing solos. Milt Jackson plays long creative riffs. Louis Bellson takes an awesome solo on ""Lester Leaps In"" after trading fours. And then, ofcourse, the Count: his performance is too amazing, and on ""Lester Leaps In"" he begins the song with 4 choruses of own special 'stride' piano which was popular in jazz' early days.The songs performed are the1. quick paced blues- ""Billies Bounce"" (Charlie Parker)13'35""2. the more relaxed ""Festival Blues"" (Basie, et al)11'54""3. ""Lester Leaps In"" (Lester Young) based off of Ive Got Rhythm 16'06"""
2,Scars and All,"I have been trying to get this song on CD since I heard Jeff sing it on Crooks and Chase in 98. It absolutely moved me to tears and so perfectly described my relationship with my boyfriend. I was thrilled to read in Country Weekly Jeff is coming back - am anxiously waiting for his new album. What a talent. His CDs will be stacked right under George Strait, George Jones and Alan Jackson."
1,Cornwell can do better,"I was reading through some of the reader reviews and one reviewer called Marino the most ""put together"" character in the book and I realized with a start that this was true! How unexpected that this overeating, cigarette-smoking, tough and prejudiced cop would be the one to stay grounded, while ""Bang Bang"" Lucy struggles to stay balanced and Kay struggles to find peace and people that aren't out to get her. Problem is, I buy the Scarpetta books to read about Kay and her WORK, not the emotional stuff, and not to see how 90's Marino is becoming. Great forensics, as always, but a mess of emotions, a mess of a plot, and a silly ending that was just too abrupt."
2,"Captivating, I couldn't put it down...","I love the Scarpetta books. The charactors in these books seem so real, it is like you can get to know them and their habits. It almost feels like you become one with Kay, Lucy and Marino, you worry about what will happen to them next. I like how Jo's parents have to deal with her lesbianism, and how Kay tries to explain it to them. These books show just how screwed up this world can be, but how there is some good in the world, people just need to be more open minded. This book was a little bit more predictable than the others though, the plot leading up to what I knew would happen. I find that annoying, but still the book was very good. I can't wait for the next one to come out."
1,Not At All Like Patricia Cornwell,"I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was hanging in there until about the last 25 pages or so. We got to France and the book just fell apart. It wasn't that great to start with, but some hairy guy. Please. The romance was wrong, the Lucy character is disgusting and just rude. I love Patricia Cornwell, but at the French trip I was ready to throw the book in the trash. I suffered through, but I hope this is her worst, and I will look for suggestions from you other readers for my next. I have not lost faith in this author. Even her wrost has a way of always holding my interest. To me this is a great writer, who just decided to write crime novels. She has great potential."
1,Let's put it together,"Over 300 reviews so far, let's summarize the half of them (although I found many very funny): Cornwell's first 3-4 Scarpetta novels were, without a doubt, excellent. These books had a good storyline and believable characters, but in the meantime the series has hit rock bottom and started digging. I am so fed up with Kay's constantly miserable life! Lucy is a spoiled brat and she should have been killed instead of Benton (although he was pretty boring too). What happened to Marino? Come Ms Cornwell, you owe your readers more than this poor little effort. I agree with another reader that Cornwell should write a psychiatrist into her next novel and get her characters a therapy.If there's no other way then end the Scarpetta series and start something new. This is not the way to go! As far as I am concerned I won't waste money on another book. This is so depressing!"
1,Could be better....,"well, as a die-hard kay scarpetta fan, i was thrilled that patricia cornwell came out with another book. one of the best things i can say about this book is that it is not as bad as the last one. i was glad to be reunited with all the characters that i have grown to think of as family, but the quality of the stories has faded since the death in the subway (true fans will know what i mean by that). although i was disappointed in this book, i will be waiting, patiently, for the next one. if you are losing faith in kay scarpetta, try reading books by tess gerriston, tami hoag or jeffrey deaver."
1,There is No Hope,"Unfortunately I gave Cornwell yet another chance to return to the form that made her early books gripping and a worthy read. This one is filled with the now trite themes we've seen before: power brokers plotting against Kay to remove her from her job, internal suspicions at the office, the angst of her personal life, the sniveling and relationships of niece Lucy, and what appears to be the ever increasing stupidity of Marino. The only refreshing thing in this book is that the villian is not apprehended in the bedroom of her home. Thank you Kay for running outside. Sorry Patricia, no more for me."
2,Exciting continuation of Cornwell's talent.,"I had read reviews of this book that were not good and almost skipped this one, even though I have read all of her books/ I'm glad I didn't. This was as good as Cornwell get."
1,black notice,I have read all of her books. The last two have been just terrible. She has lost her touch. Try Nelson Demille- he is outstanding!
1,"Bad plot & character development, just plan bad=0 star","I was a fan of Cornwell's very early books but in the last few years I have given up on reading them because of her poor writing. I was influenced to read ""Black Notice"" because of some very glowing reviews on this web site. Luckily I didn't buy the book but found it at my local library. I read the first 50 pages or so and couldn't believe that anyone would publish a book with such poor plot and character development, poor knowledge of police procedure, and choppy unconnected writing style.Ms Cornwell either needs to take a vacation from writing or her editor needs to edit better."
2,"Overall, a good read.","I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I was glad to see Scarpetta back. Even though this novel was weaker than her earlier ones, it was a far cry better than Southern Cross or Hornet's nest. Scarpetta's character was a little too depressed and drug the story down a little. Overall, though, it was enjoyable reading."
2,Great Book one more for a great series,Ok I was reading the reviews and I think alot of peeps are giving this book a bad review. The book has twists and turns but also has a startling sense of reality. It shows that not everyone deals with things the same way. and if you think about it Kay has got a lot to deal with .... How many men in her life has she lost now 4-5 and the romances take a lot out of her because when she loves she loves with all her heart unless shes scared... and everything thats happening in the end just leads to a greater plot in the next Book I cant wait to read The Last Precient
1,Don't waste your time !,"I have never been draged through this author's sordid mind before, and I don't plan on it happening again. Her characters are the most implausible group I have ever encountered. She lumps totally opposite people together and never gives us a single reason why we should believe these people would ever have anything to do with each other. She drags us up and down the narrow streets of her mind splattering us with gore and deceit, but never gives us a reason to feel for these troubled characters. It is seemingly an after thought that she finally creates the main villian in this story. He never actually materializes though, and of course it is next to impossible to believe that he even could exist. All that is bad enough, but suddenly and inexplicably the author tires of the entire charade and ends the story so abrubtly that it took me a few moments to accept the fact that it was finally over, and be grateful that it was. Don't waste your time !"
1,Continued Disappointment,"A new book starring Kay Scarpetta is guaranteed to cause me to pull out my checkbook immediately. Unfortunately, like many of the other reviewers, I found Black Notice a disappointment for a number of reasons. Wesley Benton was a moderating influence in previous stories, and I miss him greatly in the current book. Kay Scarpetta seems less organized, more bitter, and her angst colors the entire story. Lucy has become a distraction, rather than a contributor to the storyline, perhaps she should have been the one killed off! I would also agree with one of the other reviews that the ending of this book was hurried, poorly crafted and undeserving of the hundreds of pages of buildup."
1,"Unless you're into frustration, don't waste your time","You never realize how truly disappointing a book can be until you realize that there are approximatley fifty pages left and countless plot lines flapping in the breeze. Cornwell is a master storyteller. Unfortunately, Black Notice if incredibly similar to many of Dean Koontz's books in that the author tells a great story but has no clue how to tie everythign together and end the book. Like Koontz, Cornwell chooses to simply end without tying up many of the plot lines.My advice, don't waste your time."
1,Full of holes and threads that peter out.,"The main story line doesn't even start until halfway through the book. There are some half-hearted attempts to tie everything together, but they don't really work.And what's with the niece and her relationship? Its as though Cornwall feels she has some obligation to include a dysfunctional lesbian relationship. WHY?? Its not as though the book's about homosexuality, and its not as though there is an integral character who just happens to be a lesbian. Its pointless. And Lucy is SO unsympathetic.I guess the worse part is that its not really a mystery. There are no clues that would allow the reader to figure anything out. Everything is resolved abruptly. Scarpetta doesn't figure anything out."
1,"Better than ""Point of Origin"" -- but could it be worse?","Okay, Scarpetta, get over yourself. Sure, your life is tough, but whose isn't? At least you're not as cranky as you were in your last go-around. And tell me, when did you stop being a simple medical examiner and start saving the world from every lunatic out there? You might want to speak to your supervisors, 'cause they're putting a helluva lot on your shoulders. And do me a favor, will you? Slap Lucy for me. I know it must be hard to be so smart and find out your ex-lover is a pyschopath, but gimme a break. And if being gay in the '90s were as tough as she makes it out to be, I and a whole lot of other people would've slit their wrists long ago. Doesn't anyone in your family find joy in anything? Maybe this new young stud of yours can knock some sense into you. I hope so, 'cause your adventures are becoming just a little too depressing for words."
2,Anywhere she is....,"Patricia Cornwell may take you to a city street in Virginia or to a country across the ocean, but the fact is that Patricia takes you where ever she goes. You cannot resist the tug of her pen as she writes her story all around you. Before you know it, you are not sure if you should put on a pot of coffee for Marino or a neglige for Benton. Thanks Patricia, we can all use a break from our own lives now and then!"
1,Terrible,"I am midway through Black Notice, the first book I have read by P. Cornwell and I cannot believe she has been a best selling author for how long? Would somebody email me at ajohnson@vvi.net and let me know what is so wonderful about these books? I am not a dodo, but this stinks.. Sorry"
1,Cornwell needs to push the narrative.,"A few years ago I discovered this series. Mystery mixed with forensic science made for an interesting story. Also you cared about Kay, Pete and Lucy. But something happened to our heroes. Kay became an adulterer. Pete became irrational. Lucy never grew up. And worse, the books started to be more about these characters who I liked less than about the problem to be solved. I just finished Black Notice. I think the whole story could have been told in three chapters and 40 pages. Everything else was personal problems and politics. I love a good mystery. The main characters should be interesting people who you care about but they should always be secondary to the narrative."
1,The Downward Slide Continues,"In Cornwell's 'Scarpetta' series, drama has increasingly yielded to melodrama, and characters have deteriorated into caricature. Moreover, the characatures have become revoltingly self-important and Self-absorbed. Scarpetta herself spends a great deal of time deploring the extent to which others fail to accord her the deference she deserves. Her attitude is understandable, though, since the world (as depicted by Cornwell) revolves around her. She is the target of all the villains, and is idolized everyone else. It's sometimes difficult to remember that she's only a medical examiner. I've about given up on Cornwell. Her non-Scarpetta books were dismal failures, and her latest Scarpetta books haven't been much better."
1,A disappointment,"Ever the optimist, I bought this novel hoping that Cornwell had improved over her last, disappointing Scarpetta stories. Kay has changed for the worse, remaining hysterically out of control during the entire novel; the realism and credibility of this character has disappeared. The secondary plots are distracting to the point that they overshadow the story line, making it incidental and trite. The climax was predictable and silly, and held no enjoyment for me.Scarpetta is overbearing, controlling and convinced of her own, singular wisdom as she seemingly fights against everyone else in law enforcement. Absurd. Lucy's situations are irrational and her character continues to be focused on her lesbianism (sounds like Ellen). I was disappointed- couldn't wait for the book to end.Save your money."
2,Great characters and wonderful suspense.,"I really like this book. I found myself invested in liking certain characters, and disliking certain others, because the character development was so well done. It was accomplished subtly, so as not to bombard you with needless minutiae. The suspense builds throughout several congruent story lines, to hold your interest, and make the reader wonder what will happen next, or what will the outcome be. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, strong characters, who have a strong ethical presence, and a love of having your imagination activated!"
1,Black Angst,"As a long-time mystery and Scarpetta/Cornwell fan, I bought Black Notice for entertainment. I wasn't prepared to be a captive voyeur to Scarpetta's angst and to wonder between the lines how much was projected from Cornwell's own psyche. The axiom is that successful writers write about what they know best. I wish she had stayed with fiction"
1,I was disappointed in the plot & characterization,I keep wanting to like these books. I don't. Kay is not a likeable person. Marino is not a likeable person (is he even a person?). Lucy is the personification of a snotty brat. Who is the winner?
1,Don't Bother,"Patricia Cornwell's books, while not great literature, are still somewhat enjoyable to me. Not so with this one. The plot is absurd, the characters anoying, and the ending very abrupt. Do yourself a favor and buy one of her other stories."
1,What's the Name of this Book Again?,I bought the audio version of this book - I'm 3 tapes down - and I keep asking myself if I've already read it. I came to Amazon.com to make sure this was Patricia Cornwell's latest book. Nothing in Black Notice is very original. It's all a repeat of Postmortem and Body of Evidence. Very disappointing.
1,get a life!!,"ms cornwell's stories are interesting, but lately dr scarpetta has become the most whinny, self centered character to hit the literary pages in some time. as for the ending it seemed (and not for the first time) that ms cornewll got tired of writing and just hurried the ending and left me at least wanting more or at least some answeres to the questions she posed in the book. overall another disappointment in the series."
1,Dismal,"While each of the vignettes suggests a possibly interesting story, none really lives up to the promise of the book. I think we all understand by now that morally unappealing people can and do own and enjoy beautiful works of art. I'm just sorry I had sit through Vreeland's novel to be reminded of it--I kept hoping it would finally get better, or there would be something to bring it all together, but there wasn't. Very disappointing."
1,I can write better,"I might as well read my own juicy but amateur stories for some entertainment. Vreeland's writing was dry dry dry. No magic, no juice, no beauty, no heart. I felt as if the characters were crying out to me, ""Please, we have so much potential! Don't let us die on this page as bland imaginings!""Her creations and ideas were unrealized and her abilities (hopefully she has more abilities) unutilized. It was more like reading a book of genealogical studies, except I have often laughed and cried more at a family history book than I did with Vreeland's story. Read Girl With A Pearl Earring instead!"
2,Follow that painting!,"Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem."
2,Unique and beautiful...,Susan Vreeland beautifully tells the fictitous tale of a piece of artwork by J. Vermeer. We follow the piece back in time through eight stories of previous owners until we end with the hardships of Vermeer himself.Each story transports you to the time and place of the artworks owner. You begin to understand them through the eyes they cast on this particular work of art as it illuminates moments of their lives making them and the art unforgettable.
2,A Book of Short Stories,"This book is really a book of short stories woven together and proceeding backwards chronologically to trace the provenance of the painting. The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional. I liked the writing so well that I wished the painting existed so I could see it. The story development itself was a little disappointing but it was a surprisingly quick read."
2,a must read,although this book was in print quite a few years agoi must say its one you can reread and enjoy time and again
1,Contrived,"Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book, The Girl With the Pearl Earring, is a much more engaging treatment of the same topic (Vermeer.)"
2,Incredible!,"I know what you're thinking. Is this going to be one of those artsy ""literary experiences"" where almost nothing happens? NO! Incredibly, this book is pretty much of a page-turner, with a group of inter-connected stories about a fictional Vermeer painting. The book is done backwards, with the contemporary story first, followed by the World War II story, the turn of the century story, etc. It works beautifully! The characters are so well drawn that you'll come to know them well in only a few pages and you'll CARE about them. You'll also care about the painting, so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind. When you finish the book, you'll turn back to page one and start again. One of the best books ever, and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce."
2,Art and Literature,"If you've ever held and antique in your hand, and wondered about all the tales it could tell, this book is for you. I understand each chapter was written as a stand alone short story, but put together, Vreeland weaves an incredible tale about one of Vermeer's paintings. If you've ever loved the light of Vermeer's paintings, you'll be even more enchanted by this fictional ""story telling"" of the life of a painting."
2,A Timeless Piece,"The depth of this master piece is timeless for all generations to come. Compared to what we are having on the market today, most of them are cheap, superficial and rediculous, I recommand this movie to everyone; at least watch it once to experiece what real love and real life are."
2,Dr Zhivago,Great movie to begin with and this 2 disc set was especially nice. I enjoyed watching the old interviews with Omar Sharif and Julie Christie which were conducted back at the time of the original theatrical release.
1,Doctor Zhivago DVD Poor Quality,I have loved Dr. Zhivago from the moment it hit the big screen but this DVD copy is of poor quality. It is cheaply produced and you discover that the movie is on both sides of the DVD. It is just disappointing. The lesson is that often when you buy cheap you get a substandard product...lesson learned. I'm going to find an old VHS copy to watch.
2,Those eyes,Lean made beautiful movies. He told good stories. And Julie's eyes can drown you. A movie the story of an observer. One of the good ones. Images you keep.
2,Sweeping historical epic,A sweeping portayal of love and betrayal in the chaos of the Russian revolution. One of the great epics.
2,Bite me,"Buffy's not your averege girl. Well she used to be the sterotypical Valley girl who's main concern was shopping and her equally shallow boyfriend. Then she meets the man who claims to be her ""watcher"" and says that she is the Chosen one, the Vampire Slayer. She dosen't believe him at first but with a little persuation she realizes her destiny. Buffy's popularity at school is falling but she's meet a new guy who makes her smile. The only problem is a powerful vampire is after her, and she may not be ready to take him on.Though not as good as the TV show, the Buffy movie is a great flick for any true blue fans. I'm just glad TV Buffy acts more mature than this Buffy. Though I would be Happy to see Pike guest star on the show!"
1,Watch This Atrocious Movie At Your Risk,"....Perhaps if I hadn't become addicted to the far superior television series before I saw it, I might have given it the benefit of the doubt, chalking it up to yet another inferior fluff movie. However, because I had the knowledge beforehand that both Kuzui and Whedon could do much better, I was disgusted by this atrocious effort at comedy. .... Yet, I supposed something good came out of the movie - the role of Buffy Anne Summers. Once matured and smoothed around the edges, the character was a gift to talented actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, shooting her to the level of fame she deserves. Also, it introduced us to the excellent James Marsters, who in my opinion is severely underrated. ...."
2,The Ultimate Rom-Com with Vampires in the Valley,"With the exception of Luke Perry's painful portrayal of a 20-something year car mechanic turned love interest, the film stand as a pillar for sensationalism brought on by the following TV series. As an avid fan of the sho, I found the discontinuity in the plot somewhat pesky but nothing significant enough to detract from this testament to the wonderful era of Dr. Marten wearing valley girls with one liners to last a lifetime.Basically Clueless meets Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula but with more spandex and David Arquette AND PEE WEE HERMAN!!"
1,Nothing new for anyone,"Only women who need feminist bravado to feel secure in their womanhood will find this bok useful because it repeats what these sad women need to hear. For the more well rounded woman who's secure in herself, this book is basically useless."
1,Batteries Not Fresh?,"I'm giving this product 2 stars because Eforcity shipped quickly and when I emailed them about the inability of the battery to hold a charge for very long they quickly shipped a replacement free of charge. Good customer service. Unfortunately, the second battery exhibits the same behavior, holding a charge---with extremely light phone use---for about half the time the original Motorola battery did. So I strongly suspect these are not real Motorola batteries, or they are simply too old to work properly."
2,Great Look at the NBA in the 70s,"Bill Bradley does an amazing job of showing what the NBA was like in the 1970s from the small details of what the locker room was like to how race relations impacted the players on his team. His player profiles were so insightful and I particularly enjoyed his looks at non-teammate greats like Oscar Robertson, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell.I thoroughly loved the book and recommend it to any NBA fan who wants a peak at a bygone era."
1,Does not work,The first four seasons were great. Did not want the episodes to end.This one you cant wait for it yo end.
1,Stick to the first three series,The first three seasons are wonderful! However......after season 3 they try and try....and try...to recapture the magic of the first three and never do.
1,Kindle edition NOT good,"It does not read well, as it is a list of items to be further researched and validated with study.And, while the content is intriguing and worth study, the kindle version is nearly worthless.* The kindle edition does not render Hebrew correctly (it's a jumble of characters & letters), though greek seems to come through, usually.* The 'tables' do not align when presented.* There are no breaks, chapters, etc to make navigation easy and this edition as a worthwhile reference."
2,A good Christian understanding of numerology,"I borrowed this book from a friend, and after reading it, I've decided to buy a copy for myself.I am always happy to find out about God's original purpose and meaning for things that Satan and the occultists have stolen, perverted, and used for their purposes- things that were meant to help us better understand God and His purposes, which, as it was presented in this book, did in fact do-I felt a whole new world open up for me and I'm not as ""afraid"" of how I see numerology used all over the world because I understand it better-from God's perspective."
2,Another Very Good Book!,I very much enjoyed this book. It covers many areas and is full of good info. Not a generic book with the word dachshund filled into the blanks. Lots of nice colour photos.
1,Not really good,"While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really."
1,Karma intended for plots to be simple,"Karma intended for formulas and plots to be simple. My Name is Earl was never screened on television where I came from for a pretty good reason - the story-line was dumb, the themes confusing and too R-Rated and the episodes beginning to become too stale and painstakingly lengthy. You could sense that the writers were scrapping the bottom of the barrel when they dwelled on homosexual prisoners from rival gangs and prom night in prison. If you want to have good memories of what a great TV series this was, stay away from Season Three."

2,Journey....We Have A Problem,"Even though this re-release sounds better than previous ones, at the beginning of the first song, ""Girl Can't Help It"", a split second of the very first drum beat is missing. Overall, the CD is excellent especially with the added tracks. If you like your recordings of studio music to be prefect like I do in most cases, then this re-release is not for you. Find one used that was recorded from the master properly."
2,Charlie's place,Nothing better then to listen to the music of one of Rock & Rolls legendary voices of all time! Steve Perry!! He has a soulful commanding voice!!
2,Bobby taught Soul 1 everything he knows,"Yes folks, it's true. Bobby taught James everything he knows. Not to detract from the Godfather himself, but Bobby is just so underrated by most who think they know something about soul music. One must take into consideration that this is a greatest hits compilation and as such has some duds in it as filler. But when you put that first track on and hear that first guitar pickin intro and then hear James back in the sound booth just shouting to get out, it's because he knows Bobby's got soul."
2,Loved Loved Loved this book!,Wow. This book is hilarious!Characters were believable. I felt as if they were people I knew.Storyline was intriguing. Loved the whole betting aspect of their relationship.I read it in one sitting because I couldn't force myself to put it down.Found myself laughing out loud and wearing a stupid grin for most of the book.What a fun read this was.It's one I would read again and again.
1,LAME!,"Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again."
2,Makes you want to start your own snowglobe collection,"'Bet Me' is an absolute, hands-down all-time favorite. While it can easily be categorized as ""chick-lit,"" this story is so much more than that. It's fun, light and airy, has funny, well-meaning, and meddling secondary characters (the couple's friends), a pair of hate-worthy exes, and some very memorable lines from the first page right up to the last. While comedy-romance may not be for everyone, this is one of Crusie's best works and worth at least one read. Just don't be surprised when you fall in love with Min and Cal, too!"
1,Unfortunate,"After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie, Bet Me was a big disappointment. The gimmicky plot was bad enough (A grown man still betting on whether or not he'll score with a woman? Give me a break!), let alone the cloying cutesyness of the unending props, but what really killed it for me was that I simply didn't like these people. With two minor exceptions, they were whiney, immature, bitchy, bitter, and boring. The minor exceptions themselves were drearily smug. Not even Crusie's trademark style can save this one. Too bad."
1,"Cute story, but...","This was an engaging, light read. Crusie is good at writing snappy dialogue, but I could not get past her choice to give her 2 leading characters the very old-fashioned names- Minerva and Calvin! I kept imagining my grandparents, which frankly is not a picture you want in your head when you're reading a romance novel!"
1,Very Very Disappointed,"I am such a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie, I have read all her books with true giddy excitment. Unfortunately this book did not give me that feeling, it was so bad I started to skim through the book, I have never done that with a Crusie book before. I almost felt like crying that was how upset I was with this book, I have re-read all her books several times, so me saying one of her books are bad is very tragic. I know I must sound so dramatic, but she is my favorite author and I feel I have been let down. I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book."
2,Wonderful funny read,"This was a terrific story that had me laughing all through it. The characters really grow on you and the plot has plenty of twists and new developments. This is my first Jennifer Cruise novel, but I will be looking for others soon!"
2,New York Slick is just that,"Great album, perfect for popping in on a quiet Sunday morning and reading the paper or making omelets. Definitely worth adding to your collection."
2,losing control,"One of Kira Reed's best. In case you don't know, Kira Reed, a former playmate who besides being beautiful, is a very good actress. The movie has a plot you can follow and keeps you intrigued til the very end. If you've never seen the uncut version on cable you won't know what you're missing, if you have, than avoid buying this movie, you will be disappointed."
1,Ye gods,"The worst record I have heard this year. The guy I bought it from sold it because he couldn't stand it. Even the Princeton Record Exchange won't take it.It's not even well-recorded. Or interesting ... even though it seems like it should be, what with Richard Stoltzman's clarinet interacting with percussion and all."
1,Bad. So Very Bad.,This movie has awesome cover art. That is about it. The catering on the set may have been good too(unconfirmed) but nothing in the film was good. The story was weak. The actors were weak. They tried to make the main character look just like Brandon Lee in The Crow. The background music songs were cheesy knock-offs meant to sound like popular songs. For the most part I laughed at it. Bad. So very bad.
1,Yikes! I should have read reviews,"Because this is an Apple product, I didn't read the reviews carefully. Didn't expect serious problems.The big issue: Because I am right-handed like most people, the cord does not reach the plug on my MacBook Pro, unlike every other mouse I've used! No where did I notice this limitation in the Amazon product description. I work faster with a mouse than with the Pro's trackpad.Now that I've tried this mouse more than a month after receiving it, it's probably too late to send it back and probably too much of a nuisance."
1,Apple always the best (FOR MAKING MONEY),"Just as other customers already said, very simple: After short time the little scroll ball gets erratic and stops scrolling.Why? Obviously because dust gets inside and then makes it malfunction. Unlike all NONApple mouses, here YOU CANNOT remove it and clean it or wash it with soap. Therefore, once it starts working erratically, you can simply throw away you Mighty Cra.. Mouse. Thanks Apple."
1,"Love the scroll ball, hate the second ""button""","It's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice, but this just isn't the answer. Maybe it is just my hands, but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button. More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left-. It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do, however, really miss the scroll ball. I know many do not, but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you've used the ball on the mighty mouse."
1,A real bummer,"I'm a big mac user, usually love their products, but I gotta say . . . this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment. Two reasons:1. The right-click/left-click technology has never worked.2. The scroller just stopped working today . . . after owning it for only a matter of months. I can no longer stroll down, just up and side-to-side.I've just ordered a new mouse."
2,Great mouse for OS X,"It took about a year but it finally gave me carpal tunnel syndrome in both arms and hands. The exposé feature is really bad for that problem. I moved back to aLogitech Optical Marble Mouse (USB/PS2)I once used for a while after buying aLogitech Trackman Wheel Opticalwhich didn't help. But after a few months using that trackball, the carpal tunnel returned so I'm now back to limited use of a Mighty Mouse, trying to use more of Tiger Keyboard Shortcuts and the Universal Access Mouse Keys feature."
2,box set dvd,"this order was very well packaged, and was shipped even sooner than i thought, also the product was better than i expected"
1,Doesn't meet the reputation,"The wimpy treatment of Jesus in this movie is disgusting and misleading. The treating him as a slacker and a dreamer borders on slanderous. Heston's acting is wooden, the plot is slow and stiff and painful to the 21st Century Christian viewer."
1,It sucks,"I ordered the Ben Hur DVD and it arrived with the middle piece broken that holds the DVD. So, the little broke off plastic pieces went to the buttom of the DVD and, of course, scratched it. For a classic movie like that for $30 it should be 4 DVD's and have some writing on the top. I waitet for the intermission part to be over after about 1 1/2 hours, and the movie never came back on.So, big, big lemon DVD - don't buy it!!!!Ben-Hur"
2,GREAT MOVIE!!!,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE AND NOW I HAVE IT FOR MY COLLECTION!!!! A DEFINTIE FOR ANY DVD COLLECTION-EXCELLENT STORY!!!
2,Classic!,"Great old classic, great acting the color and scenes were spectacular,glad I now have it in my collection of old movies1"
2,An Excellent Epic,"This movie is truly legendary. What I can't stand is people criticizing it for copying other films. Can anyone explain how Ben hur could have ""stolen"" from Smokey and the Bandit when Smokey and the Bandit was made nearly 20 YEARS after Ben Hur? If you are going to criticize a movie, at least get your facts straight. That argument is just as bad as criticizing The Seven Samurai of copying The Magnificent Seven Ughh, manners people! manners"
2,Essential edition,"Well, the movie is arguable the greatest movie of all time, and the edition is in fact the best ever so, what more can i add? The image is so astonishing that you even can notice the imperfections of the film, only 2 little things are not perfect, but they are so little that most of the people will not realize. One during the chariot races (only a decimal fraction) and another one during the battle at the sea). The prize is great too. So, make you a favor and buy it.BTW, amazom.com works 100 % perfect."
2,"The Greatest Hollywood Epic since ""Gone with the Wind""","William Wyer's epic masterpiece is now in a four disc DVD set with bonus features as exciting as a chariot race, it's the epic story of betrayal, freedom, loyalty & revenge, the tale of a hero, a tale of the Christ. The legendary Charlton Heston who brought the savior of the hebrews Moses to life stars in a mighty performance as Judah Ben-Hur. It's a spectular & sweeping triumph, a mighty crowning achievement, terrific entertainment. See this legendary film."
2,One of the greatest films of all time.,"Charlton Heston gives his best performance of his long distinguished career as the Jew Judah Ben-Hur who stood up to the might of the Roman army and became a legend . Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are excellent as the boy hood friends turned foes.Oh yeah, watch out for the little chariot race, it's quite good."
2,First time Anais Nin Reader,Delta of Venus By Anais NinExcellent Erotica. This is the first time I have read her work. Will read more.
1,wont buy without listening sample!,"the description is interesting, but nowhere to find a listening sample. wont buy a cat in a box! more customer service please!"
2,Angelic music,"If you like uplifting, soothing music that will waft you above the mundane and touch you to the very core, give Snatam's music a try. You may just love it."
1,not rock and roll,"I bought this album when i was converting from tape to cd and could not find This Means War, or Beyond Belief on cd. This one had the songs on it that I was looking for but the original versions compaired to the new versions is like some one took a Metallica song and had the Back Street Boys sing it accapella"
2,Awesome,"I love this movie...its so classic, and like a Disney but buff and with more romance. Girls kick butt and the fightin scenes are the greatest...one of the best Foreign films Ive seen."
2,Classic Chinese Folklore,Anyone and everyone in America has grown up on the fairtales of Europe. This is one the best movies out there about a classic chinese tale of swords and sorcery of horror and love. As the title suggest. I can't really find the words to explain it but this movies rates up there with Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2. Its that good.
2,WATCH VIDEO WITH AN OPEN MIND,"I just finished watching this video and I have to say wow this truly blew me away. Great collaborations, great sounds and footage.The only people singing in this video are those who appreciate and understand Bob's music. It is not Bob Marley who is singing, so stop criticising the rap/reggae mixes. Not all the songs are about rap/reggae. The majority of the songs are reggae.The extra footage on the video was excellent and surprised me.Only downfalls in video are ""waiting in vain"" performance???? and an absense of bunny wailer and bob himself =)Lauryn Hill (my babes)was awesome, Ziggy was outstanding and Stephan blew the video up with ""High Tide or Low Tide"".Overall it is a good video and recommended for those of both old school and new school reggae/rap/ragga"
2,GO OUT AND BUY......NOW,"The best live album from the pulse. Extremely tight sound and reminds you of steel pulse at their very best. I kept playing this CD over and over again, but then again I am Steel pulse number one fan.IT MAKES SENSE TO STUDY REGGAETOLOGY!!"
2,Great Purchase!,This book is full of fun activities that can be used in my classroom. I would recommend this book to any Language Arts teacher!
2,A great book for all ages to appreciate!,"This book combines humor and wit with lessons appropriate for all ages. The author is able to paint a clear picture of the joys of being friends with people who are different. The illustrations are fabulous, and you will want to read this book many times over."
1,a very shallow character,I enjoyed the reminders of the fifties but I couldn't get past her shallowness. When one of her friends starts to date a boy that is out of their circle she suggests that her friends class finally shows. She is an avid reader but seems so unconnected to anything that is going on in the world. I don't think she would have been someone that I would have been interested in when I grew up in the fifties. I thought it was a story going no where and had a hard time finishing it.
2,Red Sox Version of Moneyball...Great Book!!!,"If you're a Sox fan, and are interested in the history and certain insider information involving certain Sox moves that may not have been the most popular, you'll love this book. It goes into the history through the current ownership and how close the John Henry and Co. side came to NOT owning the Sox. I grew up near Boston and have followed them closely my whole life, and this book gives me information that I did not know about, kind of a different perspective."
1,It's junk don't buy it,"It's hard to cock, it's hard to load, it's hard to shoot, and then it doesn't even have power to penetrate cardboard. I wanted to give it to my wife, so she could chase rabbits, and stray cats out of her garden, but the effort to squeeze this trigger makes my hand shake too much to hit anything, I doubt if she could even squeeze a shot off. It looks real eneugh in a dim setting to possibly chase away an intruder. Though pointing a fake gun at someone is probably the best way to get your self shot, so I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic,"Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic is about an old widow named Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle who has cures for everything! For example: The Interrupters Cure, The Tattletales Cure, and The Never-Want-to-Go-to-Schooler cure. One time Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle had to use her magic on a boy named Christopher. Christopher had the worst table manners in the world! Christopher's mom called Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle to see if she could help. Well, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle had a pig named Lester who had the best manners is the world! So Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle let Mrs. Brown keep Lester for a week. Lester taught Christopher the best table manners in the world! I'm 10 years old and I don't like to read books, but I loved this book! (Parents would too)!"
1,One of the worst films ever made?,What alternate universe did the makers of this film come from? It doesn't even deliver on the ick factor like Ilsa She Wolf of the S.S. did. It's just plain embarrassing.
2,Their best CD no doubt,"I didn't care to much for their music after ""Core"" and ""Purple""... or so I thought. I just knew what I heard on the radio. I bought ""Thank you"" just to see and then I bought this one. ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" was so good that I had to go back and get ""Tiny Music From The Vatican Gift Shop,"" which is also excellent by the way."
1,STP goes Pop...,"What a mistake it was to buy this CD. This is one of those CD's that has 1 or 2 good songs on it. I was expecting the usual STP hard rock that made them famous, instead this CD is 90% ""STP does Pop music"". I wish I could take it back to the store...If you like Pop music, you may like this CD. If not, don't buy it..."
1,They coulda' aspired to be so much better..........,"... However...I anxiously awaited ""Shangri"", bought it the day it was released, and an hour later had a great little coaster for my table (the CD was subsequently broken in a game of Trash Frisbee). The songs were so trite and repetitive that any positive aspects of them were lost to redundancy. After listening to it, I would have rather sat on Satan's lap in Hell than be subjected to such a horrible display of otherwise talented individuals attempting to all of a sudden be happy-go-lucky pansies. I mean, how do you go from ""No. Four"", in which the speaker is confronted with his own sins and shortcomings on Judgment Day, to ""Hello It's Late"", which is just an unoriginal rehash of ""Amazing Grace"" (I mean, Amazing Grace is a classic song, performed by everyone from Johnny Cash to Dropkick Murphys, but come on...).The rest of the album is equally empty and suicide-inducing to most serious music fans. Don't waste your time, money, or mental well-being."
1,This is why you shouldn't marry and have 2 kids,"SW, after going to jail and releasing two sub-par records (NO4 and this one), has so much nerve to marry and father two kids, when because of the commercial failure of both, is going to find it a challenge to support his out-of-control, multiplying-like-rabbits family. There are heavy reasons this coaster of a cd hasn't even sold past gold status: because it's a pain. THat's why. Every song gets worse as you listen to more on the track list. You'd think it wouldn't be possible, cause the chances of one being good would neutralize all of 'em being horrible, but it's not to be. This is so bad that if STP back in '92-'96 would have heard of what nightmare they'd turn into, they would commit suicide; or at least would beat up their future degenerated versions."
1,STP goes out with a whimper,"Possibly the last album from Stone Temple Pilots, 2001's ""Shangri-La Dee Da"" is undoubtadly the worst album from the band. Most of the tracks featured here either sound too poppy or too generic, and the lyrics (""there's so much God can teach you..."") are trite and uninspired. Scott Weiland's voice sounds great though; when this album was being recorded he was cleaned up (for a little while anyway) and his voice greatly benefited. As for the rest of the band though, I can't understand what happened to them here. ""Coma"" and ""Hollywood Bitch"" are standout tracks, but that's about it. All in all, if your a new fan of STP, check out ""Core"" or the brilliant ""Purple"" before listening to this disappointment."
2,can't wait for their next album,"In 1994 I bougt their single Plush. Vasoline was the next one.In 1996 I heard Trippin on a hole in a paper heart. That song was in my head for years. Last year I bought Tiny Music for thatsong. A great album with no bad song on it. No 4, purple and Corewere next. Maybe a little late but not too late to became a fan.Their last effort Shangri-La Dee Da is a classic too in today'sirritating and narrow-minded music scene. Shangri-La Dee Da gotgreat rock songs on it. In addition I also like their soft side. It was like listening to The White Album. Even the fiercest critics must admit that STP got a great endurance. I can't waitfor their next album."
2,BAD TIMES FOR MUSIC!,"I just listened to Shangri La Dee Da and, to be honest, is not what I expected, I liked it though, but there's nothing to do with the STP I was used to.Lots of people say STP and other american bands are having a bad time,(maybe because Pop is everywhere) while british bands are taking the lead.Shangri La Dee Da is not usual coming from STP (personally that's what I think), but people should consider Scott is living a happy new life and that makes the difference.Good Work, I will always be proud to be a STP fan!"
1,Maybe Dave Coutts wants his old job back!!,"Tool is the best band nowadays, for the one, sorely sensitive reason that stp are failures: as stp's career has furthered itself, their albums have died. Tool, on the other hand, only continue to get better with each release. STP NEEDS to stand to take a lesson from Tool's page, and stop putting out fearsomely abnormal pop garbage. To every mistaught, five-star reviewer: you should employ excessively MORE virtuous standards, like the Tool analogy, in your spitefully self-righteous, hidden agenda reviews, where you fake that stp's shangri-la is buyable."
2,Great insight into one of the best selling album of all time,This is a great DVD from the classic albums line. the DVD is split into 2 sections part 1 is 50 minutes (?) It goes into great detail how the band put this album together. The interviews were excellent and Steve Clark finally gets the recognition he so finely deserves (and has done for years). I think they should have had more than a 30 second interview soundbyte from Steve though. This dvd also features promo videos for different songs both live and through music video. In closing on section 1 I thought this album had the band at breaking point though it was very draining on all on them to get the results that they got.The second part about 50/51 minutes Joe and Phil take you almost track for track telling you how each song was put together. Joe and Phil also perform unplugged versions of songs from Hysteria. Overall this was a very DVD I got mine for... and I thought it was wellworth shelling out for in the end.
2,I bought the cd on a whim and gut instinct...,"and I don't regret buying it. It's an overall fantastic cd. I was trying to think of who her voice resembles. I'm reading a lot of Janis Joplin, Alanis Morisette, Sheryl Crow but I would like to add Stevie Nicks (voice wise) on some of those tracks.My favorite tracks are; Just a Little Hole, LA Song, Is That Too Much To Ask, Get Your Sh*t Together, and Mama.Her voice will, undoubtedly, catch you but don't pass up her lyrics while it does..."
1,Misleading,"I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed. It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source. So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi. If you have only optical audio to take care of, you will be find with this receiver. But if you are looking at it just because it has ""HDMI"", beware and read the fine prints."
1,A poor book overall.,"Flashes of what could have been a great story, but ultimately disappointing. The final pages seeming attempt to turn the story into a fable were too little too late."
1,"Horrid, Disgusting and Vile","I found this to be a work of no redeeming value. I treasure my books and I threw this one out. I wanted the hours of my life I spent reading it back. The characters are flat, the plot stale, and the action lame. Additionally, every woman in this ""novel"" (and I use that term loosely here) is a prostitute, betrayer, or sadistic torturer. Stay away."
2,Great Movie from a Beautiful City,I really enjoyed this film and I do not generally enjoy subtitled movies. The characters were believable and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Mehmet and Francesco slowly develop into a physical and emotional bond. The only reason I did not give this film a 5-star rating is because I disliked the ending. I felt that it's message was one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life and that it has no serious future. This is simply untrue. There was no need to make the wife into the type of character she became. Great scenery and a rich introduction into Turkish culture and family life.
1,Pointless movie!,"This movie is pointless. It's not erotic. It's not poetic. It's not passionate. It's not dimensional. It's not dramatic. It's just plain boring, and it doesn't even look very good. Most of the film takes place in dark, dingy rooms. The lead actor (Vittoria Gassman's son) is attractive, but not much in the talent department. Skip this movie."
1,Buy a Different Edition,"This edition was scanned from the original using Optical Character Recognition software to keep the cost down, therefore, there are typos that resulted from smudged or worn pages. While this information is disclosed in the book as well as in the product description from Amazon, the typos can be distracting while reading. Also if you need to read the entirety of the novel, do not waste your time with this edition as it only covers chapters 1-31. There are many more than that (63 I believe). Overall, I would not recommend this edition to anyone. Do not waste your money on it!"
2,An Irresistible Winning Comedy! Halarious!,"This movie si really funny and one of the best of 1997, it is very original and it gets it's laugh in a very unique and honest way. The acting is great and the actors are perfectly cast, the accents are a bit heavy, but you can still understand. I recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a good comedy and a good time."
2,I loved it!!!!!!!,I took my husband to see this at the theatre and didn't tell him what it was about. It was one of the nicest afternoons that we have spent together in years. Even my 75 year old mother enjoyed it. My son just bought me the sound track for Mothers day!
2,Different and great....,"This movie is "" different "" and great as achange of pace from the standard farethat is available. Watch this movie andbe totally engaged in a new experience--and have a great time to boot.Highly entertaining and I do recommend itto anyone seeking a good time movie."
1,A test of credibility,"THE FULL MONTY is a movie buff's test of credibility. It doesn't have the suspense to carry on as a drama. If it is a comedy, the film is a one joker. It is predictable to the nth. Scene A: We're off, we're going to get going with our nude revue--oh! oh! there is a problem that we have to sort out with one of the guys who is going to back out of dancing in the nude and that's funny! Scenes B,C,D etc. : Same as Scene A with a different guy ad predictalitum. What ever happened to those good British comedy story writers who gave us Wrong Box and Ladykillers?"
2,A classic!,"Must read. If you like poetry, then you must read Beaudelaire. This book is actually part of the French curriculum or was at least for a very long time when I was at school and still it is a pleasure to read as an adult, also maybe even more because I know can read more into it. A must.."
2,excellent book,We love this book so far and it came very promptly after ordering. My son likes this year's literature much better because of the stories covered in this publication.Thanks! We'll order again from you!
2,Soulfull and Gorgeous Writing,"I don't know where to begin with my praise and appreciation of this book. Right off the bat I loved the atmosphere, the harbor and the lobstering, the lapping sea and creaking boats--and, in the midst of these atmospherics, the lobsterman's inner life.The author's ability to enter the minds and sensibilities of these four people is wonderful. We see how differing perceptions take their toll. I was especially impressed with his ability to fathom and render the many layers of the women. I'm definitely going to check out Mr. Weesner's other works. The writing is at once elegant and unpretentious. The people are likeable and complicated. The story casts a spell. I loved it."
2,Any Gardener's Must-Have Book,"I have other gardening books, but none of them are as easy-to-follow or as comprehensive as this one. The text is so much fun, it's easy to read cover-to-cover. Yet, if you need specific information on a certain type of vegetable or technique, the index is very easy to use. The appendix gives the dates and growing seasons for every major (or minor) city in the U.S., as well as additional resources and catalogs to consult. A wonderful resource for a novice or an experienced gardener."
1,Terrible toffee,The toffee tasted like butterfinger bars... ok...if that is what one thinks toffee should taste like.. Very underwhelming.Dissapointed and will not buy this brand again
2,A writer's book,"This is a book about becoming real in a world of unreal people. Not many of London's regular fans liked this book, a little too real for them I suppose. But, writers love this book and with good reason. If you write and haven't read this, put it in your shopping cart right now. If you're looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one."
1,Not famous for good reasons.,Three chapters on doing laundry. 30 chapters on trying to get a story published. Stupid ending. Not worth the while.
1,Broke.... After I broke it with a hammer!,"What is she thinking, all of the song have absolutely noappeal. I listened to it once and that was all it took for me to hateit. Her voice is sqeaky high and nasaly like that of Suanza for those of you who know who I'm talking about. No soul and all her malismas are weak, without skills but repetition in the studio. I certainly hope Suanza won't try the same in the future. One huge embrassement is all we need for the Asian community.I would have gave it NO stars but in order to share with all of you my opinion, I had to give her at least one. Just to let you all know negative 5 stars is an understatement. END"
1,Oh Please!,"First of all, the lady should not go around declaring that she is the first asian singer to sing R&B. (It's more like a tacky version of R&B-pop) Nor should she go around (for she did in Asia) saying that she hopes the Grammy committee will consider her as a nominee (God forbid).The songs lack soul, although she has a nice voice. Most of her songs lack substance, and she trys to be hip and everything but fails (plus she even has two songs with almost the same title!). I have no idea why Kelly Price would want to guest on this CD...Coco Lee can do much better than this. She had better, if she ever wants to be considered a world-class singer. Disappointing. Don't know what the hype has been about."
1,My God! where is the creativity?,"Wow... as I express, I don't know what those song writers and singers are doing? Sampling others has been a trend that pretty much thumbs up our music industry thus far (Yeah. all you copy cats, you know who you are!) I find it very tiring listening to her music. First I have to be proud that she is first asian ever hit the U.S. market. BUT, I am so disappointed that she didn't do it with a BAM! She tries to hard to imitate artists like Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,and Whitney Houston. All the songs are pretty much the same from track 1 to track 10. (I gave it away the next day. I should've bought Best of Mozart! ) Please bring back the nuances!"
1,What a disssapointment,Wow I waited all this time for THIS - what was he smoking. Is this the new trend to try to be like Outkast and mix bad rock with hip hop.Come on Mos you can do better. This album is unlistenable and it almost pains me especially when I compare it to the first.3 out of 19 songs are just OKThe Easy SpellChampion RequiemLife is RealIt's too bad. He is going to have to come again in order to claim back his respect.The mystique is no longer
1,WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!,"I REALLY LOVE MOS, BUT I HATE THIS ALBUM. THERE ARE 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS ON THIS SELL-OUT FEELING ALBUM. THE SONG WRITING LACKS THE SUBSTANCE, AND DEPTH THAT MOS FANS MAY BE USED TO. THE CONSTANT REPEATING OF; YEAH YEAH, UH COME ON UH, LEAVES ME WONDERING WHERE ARE THE LYRICS? IF YOU LOVE THE THINGS THAT SEPERATED MOS DEF FROM STANDARD HIP HOP DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."
2,The Unthinking Brilliance Of A Casual Genuis,"Most people will be put off by Mos Def's new album on the basis that it's different from the norm and what they are used to listening. I have read reviews treating it as Hip-hop and reviews treating it as rock. I've yet to read one that views it as I do as an eclectic amalgamation of all forms of music that are dear to the artist. This album is Mos's own; it's selfishly his own. Yet some of the tracks appear to be put together so casually that it is all you can do to listen and revel in the sheer brilliance of such haphazard beauty. I would Mos Def recommend this to all lovers of music, if however you constrain yourself based on genre, you should be careful. This album makes 'The Love Below' seem like a cynical commercial cash in."
1,New Danger should have been danger.,"Mos Def has produced great albums, but new danger is not one of them, this is utterly forgettable and predicable dud, featuring a plot on this album that is so ridiculous the songs are over the top, mos def singing and everything else is so preposterous, it makes KRS-One happy, I Hope he does a better album next time.New Danger Album Review * 1/2 Star."
1,Horrible...,"When I heard that Mos Def was coming out with a new album, I couldn't wait. Black On Both Sides is one of my favorite albums ever and I picked this up as soon as I could. When I listed to it I couldn't help and be dissapointed. I was expecting something much better than this."
1,"Garbage, garbage and more garbage","Mos Def spends a good portion of this album making gripes about something or another.Here is my gripe to Mos Def, thanks for wasting my $15 with this crap album.Now Mos Def not only makes bad movies, but bad albums too."
1,"ehh,,,take a pass","I have to say that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. I was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one"
2,A Master Statesman/Politician,"A well documented video on the life of Britain's finest statesman/politician, Winston Churchill. The video was everything I expected and more on this man's life. Well done!"
2,Lost Potential in Spy Drama...,"A young mathematical genius, Tom Jericho, is returning to the British code-breaking center during World War II after he has been sent away due to personal problems. They are now trying to crack the new code that the Nazis use when they communicate with their U-boats, since it seems like the Nazi's are now trying to attack convoys coming from the US with food, ammunition, and other equipment. The British Intelligence Service is very suspicious of how the Nazi;s knew that they had cracked the former code and they begin to scrutinize Tom's past. Enigma can be described as a cat and mouse game that has a soul, but lacks flesh."
2,Flawed but very intelligent WWII thriller,"Enjoyable, smart WWII thriller about code breaking, based on a true story, and notable for being a war filmmore about human intelligence then daring action. The script by Tom Stoppard is strong.While it's a very good film, some irritating flaws keep it from being great. With the exception of Kate Winslet, alot of the acting is over the top. Worse, the film wimps out on the true story, and misses some fascinatingcomplexity, since in real life the lead character was gay, at a time where that alone was enough to win everyone'sdistrust and indeed he faced persecution in the post-war years rather than being hailed as a hero.Further, the whole style of the film feels old-fashioned in a way that goes back and forth between charming andfeeling forced.And yet, all that said I'd still urge people to see it, for daring to be a wartime thriller with smarts."
2,A great find,"I stumbled upon this album and immediately fell in love. The songs resonate in memory; the emotions expressed are universal experiences; the feeling way they're presented is unique. Nick Reifsteck has a rich baritone that has the same quality the great Ian Tyson possesses, evocative and lyrical. You can dance, you can just listen, you can cry--this album runs the gamut from giving opportunites to just get the old ya-yas out, or to reflect on the fools we all are for love."
1,the shadow of her smell,"ok, now THIS one is dick & liz at their most self-indulgent. even ""boom"" (not yet released on dvd, alas) is a better movie, if only because it is sooooo bad. it is amazing to realize that right after this, arguably her worst performance, taylor went on to give her best in ""virginia wolff"". i have given this a second star because the shorts about the making of the film (included on the dvd) are pretty interesting. only for dick & liz completists."
2,One of my favorite love stories,"I was able to see this movie in high definition ON DEMAND USING XFINITY/COMCAST. The picture quality was equal to a Blu ray, however is was full screen. The movie titles were in 2.35 widescreen. NOW FOR THE QUESTION,SO................HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE TO CREATE A BLU RAY???????????"
1,Not One For Wedding Processions,"Adult literary techniques do not always translate well to children's books. Although there is some interesting insight into the lives of children that shows through this book, the writing is forced. Having not read the other Rootabaga Stories, I can't say if Sandburg wrote everything this way, but this particular story is probably one of the most annoying books I've read to my child. The awkward illustrations didn't help either.Having said that, a book is a book and everybody enjoys different kinds of books. I would simply recommend checking it out at the library before you buy it."
1,Another Disappointment,"At this point I am undecided about this whole series. Once I get over the poor writing style, the overused cliches and simpleton dialogue, I can usually get through her books. Usually her ideas are phenomenal, but the execution tends to be mediocre. It is so frustrating-think of what a good writer could do with these story lines! This book is no different. The idea is awesome-a Dark Hunter falls in love and impregnates a half Appollite who is destined to die. But once again, the execution of this idea sucks! And it doesn't even make sense half the time. For example, Wulf is squeamish about drinking Cassandra's blood and initially refuses. Even though it would save her life! And Cassandra accepts this. Come on, give me a break. Plus the ""out"" that Ash gives them in the end is way too convenient. I will try a couple more books in the series because I did like Night Pleasures and Dance with the Devil, but if they are anything like this I'm done."
2,Love Kenyon's books !,"I recommend her books highly. She also writes as Kinley MacGregor, Highland series, and those books are wonderful, too. Her romances are heartwarming, fun, intelligent and believable. You can't put them down."
2,Finally a plan of action...,"I read a few other books, and they were good in that they told me what I needed to change to be a good husband. This book was different in that it had a plan on how to repair your marriage and how to use what I had learned in real life. It had a few steps that you both can do to get on the right track. I appreciated the honesty and frankness of the guidance. You or your spouse has the option for divorce, but if you don't want to choose that, it show you what you need to do and work on to fix things."
2,Piano trio at its finest,"My favourite type of jazz is the piano trio. And the Roberta Piket trio is fabulous. I picked up this cd in a store, not knowing anything about her, and I have to say, it is one of the best buys I have ever made. Not only is she a wonderful pianist, but she is also a terrific composer. On this disc they play 3 of her original compositions as well as 4 standards. With her wonderful improvisations and reharmonizing the standards become brand new again. On two of Pikets originals, 'Just a Blues' and 'Five-Four Play' the trio is joined by saxophonist John O'Gallagher. I really can't praise this cd enough, just go buy it and see for yourself that the future of the piano trio is in very good hands."
2,"Without question, one of the most complete movies I've seen.","I can only add my voice to the choir of accolades for this thought provocing, moving film. Few films are as complete in every respect in which a movie can be. I have searched for a copy of this film for five years, and can but wonder why films of much less repute are released while this epic is kept from us."
1,Very disappointing,"I've never read Michael Stackpole and was pretty happy with the first book in this series..couldn't wait until the second one came out. Of course, the ending was a bit of a shock (the author's own notes warn about ill will towards him because of it) but I still was hoping the story would pick up a bit of speed and resolve itself in the third installment. What did I find? Ho-Hum...I had to force myself to finish. Nothing is resolved to any satisfactory measure - the most important character is a lump of clay (literally) and the other characters just seem to start fading away. We can't always expect a happy ending, but there didn't even seem to be one at all! A thoroughly disappointing way to spend some hard earned cash. Next time one of his books come out I'll be sure to see if my local library has it first so I at least don't bother spending my own money."
1,FALLIN' FOR SAW PRODUCTION,"It didn't work for Kylie Minogue, neither Bananarama, the SAW production it's the music that dated the less gratefully from the 80's music. So Summer take on this ill advice move, although yes we all know she returned to the top 10 with THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL, the sound on this album sounds extremely dated, and hearing the entire album it's extremely painful since I DON'T WANNA GET HURT and LOVE'S ABOUT TO CHANGE MY HEART sound extremely equally the same. This record does not differ from other produced SAW, who in fact could be say was pure 80's POP disposable music, no wonder they didn't promote Kylie's 80's music in America, it was like this Summer album painful."
1,Worthless!,"This book is 50% old exams (old, and current exams are available for free on the USPTO website) and 50% snippets from the MPEP (also available for free on the USPTO). The snippets are have plenty of errors (both typos and in content), its outdated, and provides almost no useful information.It provides only the highest level of overview that doesn't come close to anything that will help you pass the patent bar. If you don't want to spring for the expensive study aids and think this is a cheap way to get some help, you're going to be very disappointed. You're much better off slugging your way through the old exams and MPEP on your own. If you write down the first sentence in every major section of the MPEP, you've just about wrote this book."
2,My husband's Fav Shorts,Finding these cotton thin mens' shorts are difficult - they are the only ones my husband will wear. Their year-round cotton comfort and roomy legs and waist is what he wants. He likes the pockets and the drawstring waist too.
1,Not true to size,"I ordered these shorts to replace my husband's old pair of Russell shorts. Although I ordered the same size, the new ones were far larger, and the fabric was much thinner and lower quality than the older shorts. I sent them back."
1,Terrible Sizing,The sizing of these shorts is a joke. Read all the reviews very carefully before buying - something has changed within the last couple years.
1,Not 100% Cotton,"I have been looking for some cotton shorts that look good on me and these are not them. The crotch area is way too long. Most important, these are not 100% cotton. I was under the impression that they were all cotton, being that they are supposed to be premium."
2,Got what i needed!,"Pretty much got what I was looking for. It fit my dinosaur of a band saw and the shipping was quick and cheap. 62"" blades are extremely hard to find but amazon pointed me to the right one."
2,"A beautiful voice and spirit, for singing beautiful music","This CD must be close to the best, if not the best, recent addition to my growing collection of Christmas CDs. Jewel's voice has a unique vibrancy which suits it pervectly for traditional Christmas carols. Her renditions of ""O Holy Night"", ""Silent Night"", ""O' Little Town of Bethlehem"", and ""Ave Maria"" are the best examples. On the other hand, she conveys a relaxed and swinging style on ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer. Her inner spirituality is feelingly expressed in her own originals, ""The Face of Love"", and ""Hands"". I hardly consider this a CD to use as background at a party. It's too beautiful to waste on a group not really listening to it. Instead, I recommend it for personal enjoyment and to share with special friends of like mind."
2,Wonderful CD.,I have never purchased a Jewel CD before and this was a excellent start. I thought she has an angelic voice and I plan on buying more CDs of hers.
2,What a pleasant Christmas CD!!!,"I was always a quasi-fan of Jewel, but this CD cements my fanship! I never realized just how nice her voice really was, or how beautiful her folksy Christmas songs would truly be.The pictures in the liner notes of the silvery, snow covered field really suit the whole mood of the album, too! It's beautiful! The kind of Christmas music that you just sit down and LISTEN to, if you know what I mean!Winter Wonderland, Silent Night, Joy to the World, Hark the Hearald Angels Sing, and the Go Tell it on the Mountain medley are perfect for Christmas in the countryside (where I live)!Oh Little Town of Bethlehem, I Wonder As I Wander and Hands capture that feeling of searching in the wind and the snow and then finding the true spirit of Christmas! And Oh Holy Night is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard from Jewel! I didn't know she could SING like that! It's wonderful!Highly recommended for anyone who wants to relax and enjoy soft beautiful music this Christmas!"
1,Merry Jewel,"This is the closest thing to mainstream folk Christmas album anyone will get. Although there are backing vocals and an orchestra thrown in for extra holiday glee, this still sticks to a campfire sing-a-long feel. Jewel's vocals stray close to yodeling territory without getting too uncomfortable.A Holiday Collection remains not as exciting as other season albums, even with a helping hand from a jingled-up version of ""Hands."""
2,Jewel has an awesome voice,"Jewel's christmas collection is awesome, she really hits those notes, this is an awesome cd for anyone who loves music. Donna"
1,Pass on the '06; you'll need the '07 by the time it arrives,"I ordered this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the 16th of December, and the 16th of January is approaching and it still apparently has not shipped. In my opinion I should receive 1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a complimentary Christmas gift for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be. They're not very attractive when they're stealing your hard earned greenbacks, think about that. Oh and by the way I've also been forced to give this item one star of which it doesn't deserve since to my knowledge it may not even exist. Thank You."
2,good headphones,"I use these headphones with my clix 2 and not many complaints here. The cord is kind of long but I can deal with it. Decent sound. The only caution that I give is to avoid turning on the headphones while wearing them and music is playing. Also, when batteries start to go it can cause some weird, loud noises."
1,"not bad, but cheap","got these headphones as a gift about a year ago and just started to use them more frequently. sound quality was better than I thought for what I expected from logitech although I feel the noise-canceling feature was weighted in one ear (the one with the battery) and that produces a hiss which is kind of annoying. Then they started to just fall apart. first a little black square panel. then another piece cracked off. actually have tape on them. Within the next year I'm thinking they'll just turn to dust. There are better headphones out there, but if you are dead set on these they don't sound bad."
1,ear piece broke after one year use,"It worked great for about a year, then it broke just above the ear piece. The mechanic design has flaw. It breaks easily."
2,Great Value for the Money,"I just wore these on a trip to China. Worked awesome on the airplane drowning out cabin noise. Made the trip much better. I was able to hear the movie much better than with my other ear buds. I have not tried the more expensive Bose units, but for $40 these were well worth the money!"
2,Best Book Ever,"Have you ever heard of the Redwall books?. I would highly recommend this book to people whom like fantasy, love adventure, adore animals, and like an action packed adventure. The book starts out with Martin (a warrior mouse) walking along a snowy path. Martin will eventually go on a quest to Salamandastrom. He goes there to find Boar The Fighter. Sadly, Boar is killed in a battle. On Martin's quest to Salamandastrom, Gonff, Young Dinny, and Log-A-Log accompany him. The Woodlanders verse the Kotir Army outcome is unpredictable. So it's your choice, (A) go charging over to a book store and buy this book, or (B) don't even listen to me. Pick A"
2,Michael Whatley's review for Mossflower,This book is an excellent thriller with mystery and non-stop adventure on every page. You just can't stop reading this novel of a lifetime.
2,An adventurous aminal tale.,"If you like action, suspence, and adventure, this book has it all. I gave it five stars because it's very well written and excitting. You should read it! I'm trying to read the whole series."
2,"""Amazing, exiting, every one who reads it will love it!!!!!","This book is Jacques's best work. Who ever reads it will love it. Touching, funny,sad everything you need to make a book perfect!!!!! Ones who open it wont be able to put it down! This is so great, you will have to read it, you can find it HERE or in book stores. Look for more of Brian's work like Bellmaker, Mariel of red wall & others!"
2,This was a gift,This was a gift for my husband to replace a casette tape he had for many years. He wanted it in the CD version. He was pleased to be able to find it.
1,Looks great but wont fit BMW keyfob,Well isnt the #1 job of a BMW key chain to fit a BMW keyfob? The slot in the keyfob is too small to insert the ring into it. You have to get a second smaller ring and attach that to to the keychain ring. Otherwise the keychain looks nice and is made with quality.
2,An alternative to Wheelock,I have finished Wheelock and its workbook. I am now using Learn to Read latin and its workbook to both take a different perspective and consolidate my effort to read Latin after a seventy year hiatus. Learn to Read latin serves that purpose. Very good selections unaltered from the original.
2,Great movie,I always rent from amazon always great qualityNever any streaming issues. Great prices I use amazon strictly I no longer use other rental options
2,"OEM, worked like a charm","OEM GM part, direct fit, solved defroster issue, got radio reception back. Need I say more?... apparently I do because it won't let me submit the review without putting more words. That should do it..."
2,Like Being in a Popcorn Popper!,"I first heard Jonathan Richman in the movie ""There's Something About Mary"" but at the time I wasn't as interested in music and didn't seek him out for a better listen. Many many years later, my uncled played the album ""I, Jonathan"" in the very somber setting of his son's memorial service. This was music my cousin liked. For that reason I will always have bittersweet feelings about these songs, but I think it also proves how bright and happy they truly are. You really can't help but move around. Like my uncle said, ""It's like being in a popcorn popper!"""
2,Greatest party album with mellow songs and dance songs,the disc gives you a feeling maybe that summer feeling because it will haunt one day in your life. Just like this cd does if your into fun and entertaining music by a musician that you can actually understand this disc is for you. Roomin' house rocks i've seen some cover bands do the number i would love to see jonathan live one of these days pick up this one.
1,Doesn't Hit The Mark,"I have seen quite a few productions of COMPANY including the original on Broadway. Unfortunately, this one doesn't come close to hitting the mark. In fact, it's way off. If the director were trying, once again, to be innovative by imposing his concept for SWEENY TODD onto COMPANY it doesn't work. ANOTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE is perhaps a good example how this fails. Were the singer and the musicians really together? I heard not. It's a tough song and this singer couldn't keep up. Who could be better than Beth Howland anyway (grin). And unless my CD player is failing, a lot of the times the singers sounded quite flat.What surprises me the most is that Sondheim would sanction this. And the weird thing for me is that I enjoyed SWEENY TODD, directed by the same John Doyle."
2,Company,Excellent production values characterize this latest Sondheim CD. Vocals and instrumentals came through with remarkable clarity so that the words could be understood and none of the Sondheim wit was lost.
2,Definitely a great album to chill and read by the fire.,"If you love piano and hearing a maestro exhibit amazing talent and passion, the Koln Concert is definitely a buy!"
1,WARNING: Product Rip-off !,"WARNING! The bridge assembly shipped is nothing like the photo. It is much cheaper in construction. The package is branded as ""Kluson"":- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT contained within the body of the steel bridge (as shown in photo), they just sit in open slots and so they pop out easily.- the actual individual saddle adjustment screws are NOT Phillips head screws (as shown in photo) but are cheap slot head screws.- the actual bridge saddles are NOT pre-grooved (as shown in photo), and grooving them yourself is a royal pain in the butt.- the holes in the bridge body for the vertical adjustment screws are NOT chamfered (as shown in photo) and so the bridge body does not ride smoothly when adjusted.Basically, the bridge assembly shipped by W D Music is total junk. It deserves a negative star rating."
2,Liberalism: A Spiritual Cancer,"Most books on controversial subject matter embody a certain element of overkill to prove their point but Michael Rose is 'shockingly on the mark' with, Good Bye! Good Men. Many in Detroit have lived through what Mr Rose describes in his book. A close friend was subjected to professional psychological counseling for a year (at his own expense) and needed none. The final report read, This client did not need counseling and has no sign of pathology or abnormality. Basically, he was just too Catholic. The current sexual crisis in Holy Mother Church clearly shows what the Liberalism of 1960-1985 produced. This brand of mis-guided and unholy leadership never results in reform or progress. Through the concerted efforts of current Rector, Bishop Allen Vigneron, Sacred Heart Seminary is healing from what I call ""Metastatic Liberalism"" and today continues to heal and grow in Grace and in Favor with God and Man. Glory to God!.....a student"
1,Take Another Look Please,"This author doesn't explore the real issue of what the church considers valuable, instead, he stays mired in the same old sacrifical muck. He tries to explain that the liberal years of the 60's through the 80's caused much of the church's decline, but many of us life-long Catholics in the real world have a somewhat different viewpoint. Narrow minded thinking and the belief that only men can run the church, has now caught up with us. But this off-limits subject certainly isn't explored. Now with the harsh light of truth shining on the recent ugliness, perhaps men with power in the church will listen, and perhaps now they'll start to widen their outdated stance about women taking larger roles. And maybe someone will even have the courage to write a book about it! If you want to read the same old stuff on Catholicism, only with a dramatic twist, then this is your book."
2,IT IS WHAT IT IS,"This film footage was filmed in low light conditions (stage lighting conditions only), so the picture quality is a little grainy - but no big deal. Walsh's voice is fine - don't be fooled by the ""purists"". Overall, this is a good DVD and I would recommend it to anyone.Here's the negative: Aside from poor lighting, as I listened to the DVD, it just seemed like some things were missing. Case in point - I believe there should have been another guitarist at least. A piano would have been nice. The lead guitar riffs came up short. But then, trying to compare a concert sound with a studio sound would be fallacious."
2,The Viking!,"This is the best NHOP cd I have ever heard! Most of the songs are traditional Danish ""Folk songs"", re-arranged by NHOP in one way or the other. Ole Kock Hansen, on Piano, has been a friend of NHOP since his childhood. He is one of Denmark's most abundantly gifted musicians, and it really shows on this particular cd. Lennart Gruvsted, is an outstandingly and accomplished drummer from Sweden. His work here is beuatifully coherent and sensitive. All in all i give this cd a top score. As I'm from Denmark, I fully understand the feelings, and moods that these 3 muscisians creates, and I hope that you will give this one a chance, no matter where you're from - just remember to have an open mind before listening to this cd, and hopefully you will have as gret an experienxe as I have had listening to this masterpiece. Thank you, and happy listening :)"
1,Pathetically Awful,"The original serious was pretty good. This 1999 movie was so painfully bad that it looks like it was the last thing the writer, Buddy Ruskin, the creator of the original series, ever did in show business. This flick is so godawful that I'd rather watch a loop of Roseanne Barr singing the Star Spangled Banner.Co-producer Aaron Spelling must have been mortified at the final product."
1,"Loud, Bright, High Action! And Borrrrring","Amazing how so much action, noise, pulsing rock music and lively young actors can add up to such a dull movie. I rated it one star because Amazon won't allow Zero stars. This one is unwatchable, literally. Not even laughable so you can't sit there and mock it. It is just boring and dull. Rent anything else at all - you're sure to like it better."
2,Inspired and Brilliant,"I didn't love this as much as I loved ""Mere Christianity"" but I did really enjoy the amazing insights of C.S. Lewis into human nature, the spirit and temptations. He really was an inspired and brilliant man."
2,Understanding the enemy,"This book was an awesome read and really opened my eyes to how the devils operate within a Christian mans mind. Beautifully written, Lewis is one of my favorite authors and was an extremely talented, beautifully versed man. A literary masterpiece due to the way it was written and the effort one must put forth to see what Lewis was actually saying apart from what was put down on paper. Enjoy!"
2,"I loved reading this, but I am sure it was not easy to write!","Absolutely great. Not an every day read, but something to pick up on occasion and read through."
2,a must read,"a must read, as applicable today as when he wrote the book. C.S. Lewis had insight intopeople and there characters."
1,Not for learning Thai,"I have to say if I were Thai and wanted to learn english, or use it to speak english for me, this and other models will do. But this does not work both ways, it only speaks english and translates to english. If you try to take thai script to english you will end up with nonsense, and a few laughes. It is a shame with the tech available that they missed out on making a great product. I have a talking english spanish translator from franklin that is simple to use and useful. I can only hope they will learn from their mistakes."
2,Amazing,"I bought this CD for my husband, and he was estatic when it arrived. The music is amazing and calms the sould on a wild and chaotic day.It was also in its original wrapping which I was very pleased with."
1,I didn't enjoy reading Frugal Families.,"I love Jonni McCoy's first book, Miserly Moms! It has so much information and recipes that I have read it several times! And give copies of it as gifts. This book, Frugal Families, was boring. I won't be reading this one again. Not enough interesting information."
2,Lots of tips,"Great book on frugal living. However, this book doesn't suggest ways to cut down on grocery costs. Gives several different areas on how to save like Pet Care and Gardening"
1,"Good music, but not the advertized music","I bought this CD after hearing Lucia Micarelli's incredibly compelling version of ""To Love You More"". You can hear the song at her website, luciamicarelli.com. However, the snippet of music above called ""To Love You More"" is *not* that song, and sadly it's what got stuck on the CD."
2,beautiful music,my husband wanted this for a certain piece of music he had heard but the whole total of music is stunning.hes fallen in love with itcompletely.
2,A beautiful strory; beautiful people; beautiful land.,"Having lived in China for seven of the past 10 years and having traveled to Mongolia many times over those years, I was surprised to find a movie which reflected the ""souls"" of the three nationalities I've known here: the Chinese, the Russians, and the Mongolians. In ""Close to Eden"" the cultures don't clash with each other; rather, they meet and reflect each other's strengths, pains, and (in the end) humanity. It is a story of a Mongolian family as seen through the eyes of the Russian truck driver in a remote area of northern China. Each culture is holding on to its own while it must intereact with the others. The actors are not ""slick"" or polished; in fact, most of them are not even professional actors; they are Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian people being themselves. And the movie is better for it."
2,CONTAINS SOME OF THE BEST LYRICS I'VE EVER HEARD,"This album features 14 killer songs. There is not a ""B"" cut among them, and ""The Last Comanche Moom"" contains some of the best song lyrics I have ever heard. Only Kristofferson's ""Sunday Morning Sidewalk"" has ever ""pole-axed"" me with similarly powerful imagery. It is a complete novel in a song with no wasted words. Hats off to Mike Blakely. I hope that he has more in him, 'cause I'm fast wearing this one out."
2,"Comprehensive, Fact-filled and a Time Saver","This book is a must have for students of all ages. It provides the URLs of some great sites for information on virtually any research topic. This book should be considered a major resource for any high school student with questions about their homework; it contains comprehensive, fact-filled pages of information. It can be used as a summary, a resource, a starting point to seek further information. Using a search engine to locate sites with content equivalent to those listed in this book would take days. I would recommend this book to the highest degree. It should be noted, however, that if you are looking for specific information (statistics, demographics, etc.) you might be better off with a good search engine."
2,Quick delivery,This book is awesome and my husband who is a duck hunter and hunts with his yellow lab LOVED this book. Its was delivered fast and the packed great so that the book arrived undamaged!
2,Great food..,"I am a long time fan of Mr. Slater and have purchased three of his books, this being the third. They all are wonderful. They assume that the reader knows a whisk from a wine opener and has at least a passing interest in making and eating great food. The health-food craze, the move toward low-fat, low-salt, low-this or low-that (and hence no fun) is acknowledged but not adhered to. Slater's emphasis is on good food. If that means adding a walnut sized knob of butter or eating a somewhat large amount of bacon, then so be it. My one objection, and it's really my own fault (He is from England, after all), is that the version I purchased is the English edition, and all of the measurements are in the metric system. Maddening but not a disaster. I also highly recommend ""Appetite"", a similar book...all in all a great book."
2,a classic jefferson starship cd,"if you are a true jefferson starship fan you must add this classic cd to your collection. the cd is chock-full of the beautiful ballads and hard-rocking masterpieces that made the starship one of the best bands of the 70's/80's. do not pass this up. this has been a hard to find gem and we can thank amazon.com for un-""earth""-ing this jewel."
2,This book is a must read for anyone visiting Louisiana.,"I was able to use the information to customize an entire 1 week vacation for my family. If you like ""out of the way"" places and ""different"" things to see and do, this is the book for you. There should be a book like this for each major city in the United States."
2,Tragic and Touching Story,"This movie is great for someone who prefers a certain European twist to their films. The characters do an excellent job in portraying life as it was in the time period. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci carry the movie along well until the resolution. The end is so abrupt and in a sense leaves the viewer hanging. Aside from the sad ending, the movie is excellent to curl up on the couch on a quiet evening and watch."
1,avant-garde failure,"i personally find johnny depp and christina ricci to be not only excellent actors, but incredibly aesthetically pleasing, so i looked forward to renting this particular film. Some reviewers of ""The Man Who Cried"" argue that the talents of the starring actors saved an otherwise horrifying script, but i disagree; not even sexual appeal could save this movie for me. i found the plot dull, difficult to follow, and unconvincing. if you adore these actors as i do, look elsewhere to fulfill your depp/ricci sweet tooth."
1,SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE!!!!!!!,"GREAT CAST / HORRIBLE SCRIPT / LAUGHABLE PERFORMACES / A WASTE OF TIME , MONEY & FILM / THEY PUT SOO MUCH MAKEUP ON THE VERY BEAUTIFUL CATE BLANCHETT THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE CARNIVAL CLOWN & THAT IS SAD / DEPP LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO KILL SOMEBODY / RICCI PLAYS A RUSSIAN LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE VIRGIN AND TURTURRO LIP SINGS OPERA AS A HORSE RELIEVES HIMSELF ON THE STAGE / SOUNDS LIKE A COMEDY BUT IT IS NOT / STAY CLEAR OF THIS DISASTER PLEASE."
2,Great stuff!,"I remember this album (remember those???) from the early 80s -- a roommate of mine at camp brought a tape and introduced me to it. That was it -- I was hooked on these English chicks! Surprisingly, there are some very sweet songs on this album -- ""What A Shambles"" comes to mind. This album just brings back great memories for me -- it's great! JAY."
1,Could have been better,"While the book had the potential to be very interesting, the wording and style only dragged on creating a book not only difficult to read, but impossible to get into."
1,Come on please.........,I hear so much fuzz comparing their music to the Beatles. Do yourself a favor and dont ever repeat this. Im sorry to say this group doesnt even get near to PFR in quality of music. This cd is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Flawless is flawless,"This is a clever, engaging story, beautifully portrayed by Demi Moore and Michael Caine. It's a movie about a diamond heist that doesn't rely on car chases or explosions."
2,great movie,It's a great!The only problem is no English subtitle on film.Cause I am a customer of oversea. So it is a little bit diffcult for understand what the story of film.
2,Gift,This was a gift to our son. He was thrilled to receive it and will continue to enjoy it for many years to come. He is a wood worker and is interested in all sorts of books about wood working and wood workers.
2,A good look into the insights of interface design.,'The Humane Interface' was a very good book. I particularly enjoyed the discussion about the metrics used to quantify the efficiency of a given interface based on its information content. Important stuff.That portion of the book should be required reading for anyone designing an interface.
1,Don't believe the hype!,"As a mechanical engineer, I've used all kinds of CAD programs as well as other types of software. This has to be one of the worst software packages I've ever used. The interface is maddeningly archaic. It makes one wonder about the caliber of programmer that Broderbund is hiring. It also makes one wonder who's writing these reviews, some hardly seems believable after actually experiencing the software.PLEASE, do yourself a favor, don't believe the positive reviews, and save your money. Given a technical background, I lulled myself into believing I should be able to handle it in spite of the negative reviews, and came away severely disappointed.Stick to a general 2D drawing program such as AutoCad, Vellum, or Visio, it'll be much less headache and still fulfill 99% of what most users are looking for."
1,Disappointing and frustrating,"There are many whiz-bang features that sound impressive but are of limited use in my experience.The basic functionality of this program is impaired. The user interface in not that intuitive, the graphic response is extremely slow, the lack of a functioning ""undo"" is maddening (in the Edit menu there is a ""undo"" button, but it is never available). I found working with this program to be very slow going, frustrating and tedious, and I found the payoff (seeing a new home in 3D) to be unrewarding. The 3D view is not that helpful; it is so difficult to control the movement within the 3D view that it is hard to concentrate on what you've just created. Also, you can't walk up or down stairs.I spend a lot of time working with complex audio/video programs and this is, by far, the most frustrating program I've ever used."
1,"do not buy this if you have a new system, lots of conflicts.","I liked the idea of being able to design a house from scratch, rather than just move walls around. I started with Punch's 5 in 1, but it locked up my system. Their technical support people told me that it was because I was running ME and I should get their professional suite. The professional version locked up my system just like 5 in 1 had. After another hour on the TOLL FREE line, no luck and the product will be returned."
1,A Deflating Turn of Events,"What began as an interesting novel and journeyed into an interesting form of describing humanity and some of our worst shortcomings, ended without any of the characters transforming into something new and preferably better. I felt cheated by how this story ended and refuse to believe that all of humanity is as hopeless, narrow-minded and self destructive as what was represented by the main character, Soledad."
1,Unable to use,I was not even able to use this product as the instructions were not very clear on how to install. There were conflicting instructions within the instructions themselves.
1,Disappointing,"We had the older model of this showerhead so figured the new one would be even better. We have been disappointed in it because like others have said, it will not stay in the correct position and creaks when you move it. It also does not have the great water flow that previous versions have had. The final nail in the coffin was when we moved and tried to get it off, the threading area was so cheap that it broke off when removing it. And we had only had it on the shower for a year."
2,The Search For A Flexible Showerhead Is Over!,"When you're 5'2"" and your husband is 6'1"", a flexible showerhead is a must! When our previous model finally bit the dust, we began looking for a replacement. We scoured the big box home improvement stores and department stores and were unable to find a suitable replacement. Thanks to Amazon, we're now back in business! This model is very similar to our old Shower Massage- it's easy to install and has a nice range of spray options."
2,Couldn't live without it!,"I have had a water-pik shower head since they were first developed and only came in white. The only thing about them is if you bend the goose-neck too much and too many times, eventually the skin will break. Of course, this was over about 17 years!! Wouldn't live without it, it's wonderful! Can be adjusted with one hand to either flow over the head, under the head (does not get my wife's hair wet) or spot-place it for soothing water massage. I bought one for each bathroom this time."
2,Flexible Shower Head,"We had trouble finding this type of shower head in Hardware Stores. Our previous one, the same brand, Waterpik, lasted 14 years. I was delighted to find this on the Amazon Web Site. It arrived in two days and took less than 5 minutes to install. My only concern is that the chrome will wear off and it won't look good. Our previous shower head was vinyl coated and still looked like new but the hose had finally given out."
1,cheap and leaky,leaks at the joint real bad...also the dial part is cheap - and feels frail - water pressure not very good...a total waste of my money.
2,Great for tall people,"I have had a shower head like this in the past so when it came time to replace the old handheld one we had, I went looking for this type. I couldn't find it locally so was pleased when Amazon had it. Easy installation (no thread tape needed, uses a rubber seal to tighten against) and you can aim the water pretty much anywhere once installed. I am 6' 4"" and this is the only shower head that I have been able to actually get under. The rest of my family is very pleased with it too so I would recommend buying this shower head 100%."
1,Higher price and lower quality,"Have spent hours looking for this item, the original was white and very sturdy. The flex tubing took a lot of abuse and it never cracked or broke. Only used this new model for 6 months and the connector that attaches to the wall pipe split and cracked which now leaks everywhere. I used the white one for about 10 years with no problems. Would really like to find the original ones that were a better quality and made with stronger materials."
1,White Boys do Steel Band??,"I didn't care much for this CD. As my title indicates, this is just a few mostly white boys doing cover of groups that I don't consider Caribbean music. Jimmy Buffett? Carlos Santana? Some of it gives you a good hint of steel band music, but it left me wanting more. Skip it if you're looking for authentic steel band music."
1,"basically, a failure - more on Victoria than Vincent","Technically, the writing style is very poor. If this was ""ghosted,"" Victoria should get a refund. But, basically - what you've heard on the street about this book is more or less true. For a child that wasn't around all that much, she is writing more from other sources. I hardly expected an unbiased opinion from the child of a broken home, but some of the none-too-subtle suggestions that Vincent was 'bi' and so on - without any factual evidence, only gossip - not to mention WHO CARES - is just too much. Another instance of licking one's emotional wounds in public, I'm afraid. Stick to the marvelous Lucy Chase Williams book, and the interesting recent book put out by Midnight Marquee."
2,"Best album of ""the poets""","The canadian poets have offered to us their best album ""up to here"" with their all time classic ""New Orleans is sinking"", great rock n roll with heavy blues and southern rythms, amazing style a very defined personality , Mr Gordon Downie is a genious also a man with a great inspiration and artistic sensibility, we need more songwritters like him, The Tragically Hip is also a very united band, members have remain the same for over 20 years they havent fall into the trap of fame and their style doesnt change for commercial success , they feel happy with their legion of die hard fans like me that will always love the hip as our little selfish secretHM"
1,There Are Much Much Better Books Out There For Dumbbells,This book is extremely basic. If you want to get into lifting dumbbells you will end up buying Dumbbell Training for Strength And Fitness by Matt Brzycki and Fred Fornicola and Men's Health Ultimate Dumbbell Guide. Those book are great for starting up and improving. This book was of no use to me since I also bought the above mention books.
2,Great Collection,I thought this cd was a great collection of movie themes played on the grand piano. It sounds wonderful!
2,His Third Best !!!!!,"Owning this LP since 1975 and last listening to it about 10 years ago. This is Mangione at his top three best. Behind Children of Sanchez and Tarantella LPs and in front of Live at the Hollywood Bowl. This is a must buy for anyone who likes Mangione. Recorded live at Massey Hall in Toronto with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra and Ester Satterfield on vocals. The quartet,orchestra, and vocals are Fantastic!!!!!"
2,Useful tail bag for day trips,"I like the look of the Iron Rider series of bags, and the small roll bag is a usefull addition to my detachable luggage. A little too small for an overnight, it is great for day trips for carrying water, laptop etc, and looks pretty good on the bike, even when empty. I haven't tested it in bad weather yet, but it looks like it will keep things dry for a while (unless you are in a hurricane). I rated it 4 because it was made in the PRC, and not in the USA, (which it is priced for) - I wish manufacturers would clearly state where their products are made in their advertising, so that when you buy an ""American"" product from a US brand, you get something made in the USA. This doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with the quality of the PRC produced product - I just wish I knew that before pressing the ""buy now"" button."
2,You Must View this Film!,"I teach sixth graders. We spend time learning about the Holocaust from our WWII unit in our SS book, as well as, our novels. I have just added a film to these studies...""The Children of Chabonnes"". All I can say is WOW! It was more touching, informative, and upliftingthan I imagined. It was wonderful. I thought of a hundred ways to use this in school...ok, I may be exaggerating, but it is goingto be a great asset to our curriculum. I cried at a few beautiful statements which I don't do easily. The members of this crew are to be congratulated for a job well done! Guess I better have tissues ready in my classroom. The music was perfect...and the camera shots, dialogue, and updates on the ""children"" added a valuable, insightful component to this award-winning testimonial!"
2,Must read!,"This is the best thriller I've read in a long time. The suspense and the triumph over evil make it an exciting read, but the little dog grabbed my heart. I read it twice and cried both times when I read about him. You will fall in love with Seattle and rejoice with him when his life finally begins to come together. This one should become a best-seller."
1,Sent the wrong part,"The company sent me the wrong part. Because they are not part of Amazon, I had to return the item and reorder it elsewhere."
2,Powerbook G4 replacement battery not bad.,Fits great like the original and looks identical but battery life is probably 90% of the original. Can't beat it for the price though. I recommend it.
1,not so hotsie,"This screenplay shows the authors have writing talent, but that it is not very developed yet. William Goldman helped write this screenplay, and even HE didn't think it was that great a screenplay (as he says in ""Premiere"" magazine). I know it won Oscars for the writers, but then Sylvester Stallone was once nominated for a best-acting Oscar...what does that tell you about the award? I think this screenplay showed promise, and I hope the writers try to develop their skill further, so that one day they may write a good screenplay. But winning an Oscar, they may think they don't need to improve, and that would be bad for them and movie audiences, both."
2,"Night Play (Dark Hunter, Book 6)",This is one of my favorites of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter Series. I must have read this book at least 10 times. I highly recommend it.
2,This is why I read paranormal romance !,"Great book. I have all the Kenyons books. They take me away from the everyday and are much better for you than that pint of chocolate ice cream. This one is more of the same....perfect. I loved the brooding hero and it was nice to see a plus size character. And for the reviewer who felt a size 18 was obese....it's amazing how Mae West managed to look so good with her obese body. And I just know Marilyn Monroe at size 16 must have disgusted us all. Please re-evaluate your concept of ""obese"" ."
2,Sweet movie,"This movie is a family favorite. We love Gary Sinese in any case, and Hallmark never disappoints. The vendor got this to us in one day!"
2,An amazing chronicle,"I don't usually go to superlative praise, but this personal little journal is mesmerizing. Begun in 1914 by a fifteen year-old German schoolboy, it records his observations from the outbreak of the First World War through each major historical moment to the invasion of Poland in 1939. In his own innocent words he marks the major stages of German struggles from the start of war, the end of war, the Versailles Treaty to the advent of Hitler as Chancellor, the empowering of the Nazi Party, and to the Second World War. He shows his gradual maturing from an enthusiastic patriot to a jaded young flyer conscripted into a war he cannot personally support, yet cannot avoid.A genuine and amazing chronicle."
2,not Return to Lonesome Dove but entertaining,"I prefer Return to Lonesome Dove over Streets. Some think McMurtry tried to hard to distance this from Return and messed things up for the fans. I wont argue. I do like the production, rewrites, and cast. They help it to be an improvement over McMurtry's book. This movie has it's moments. Far better than the book. Not a bad one to watch when you've run through Lonesome Dove, Return, Deadman, The Series, and The Outlaw Years."
1,Terrible finish to Lonesome Dove.,"If you read my other reviews you will see I am one of the biggest fans of Lonesome Dove and even Return to Lonesome Dove. But Streets of Laredo is nothing like Lonesome Dove except for the names. Call a bounty hunter give me a break. But what is even crazier than that is Lorena married to Pea Eye. I think Larry made this so far out there to get back at Hollywood for their movie. What he didn't realize was he was hurting the fans who loved Lonesome Dove so much with this stupid ending. Any true fan of Larry's Lonesome Dove has to know this was not the way he had envisioned this to end when he wrote Lonesome Dove. Very disappointed in Larry's ending, give me Return To Lonesome Dove any day of the week."
1,Don't Let the Smooth Taste Fool You&#65533;,"It just sounds like the Stone Roses. Vocally, that is. In the aptly titled Unfinished Monkey Business, Mr. Brown gives further creedence to the theory that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, and the parts, when parted out, suck. Since we last saw the swaggering Stone Roses front man, we see he may or may not have learned how make use of a Casio keyboard (see track 12), he now practices some form of cool guy martial art (see jacket photos), and probably just put this crap out 'cause he was running low on puss (personal assumption by me). By track six, with some horrid female guest vocalist, any illusion that this record was worth half my 24.85 plus tax was blown. I wonder if they accept opened merchandise for returns."
1,Men couldn't get away with that...,"The book's title says it all - I'm the victim, and, damit, I want out! No mention of maturity or responsibility whatsoever. I'm a male BPD and am angry at the oblique, reverse bias so obvious in this book. She throws a tantrum and gets 'support'!?! I can only dream of getting all the help I need and can't get away with the things she does. Support is something I have to give myself in trying to recover.All I can say is that it must be nice to have money, and I'm not liberal. Seems that only women can show emotion - when men do it, they get thrown in jail."
1,ridiculous,"I usually enjoy psychology-related books, but this one was ridiculous! It was looong and tedious, and her drama queen behavior is downright embarassing. If I ever acted like she did, my husband would be out the door! He must be a fool. I've never come across anyone who is as full of herself as this woman is. I highly doubt this book can actually help anyone."
2,The waterpik trs-559,"The waterpik trs-559 has two water filters inside the attachment to your water line. One is white and the other is black. The manual says you can choose not to install the white one, but pull both of them out. If installed this way I kid you not the handheld is the best handheld shower I have ever used. Without the two filters water flys out the handheld as amazing speed. If installed my way this handheld is worth twice what amazon want you to pay. This product is top of the line better than the 50 60 70 dollar handheld trust me."
2,Great for the price!,"Our shower head on our double headed unit broke so we bought this item as a replacement. It was super easy to hook up as a replacement to the original and works great! Love the pulsing option, it feels great on a sore back."
1,Disappointment,This hand-held shower head doesn't have the usual force associated with a shower. The massage is weak and not at all invigorating. I am not happy with this purchase.
2,Very nice!,"Easy install, good pressure, and good quality material. I'm very happy with this purchase. I wish the combo spray was a little bit wider, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.I would buy again."
2,Very Impressed,"For this price, this is the best shower head you can get. I thought it would be a flimsy piece of junk but it is really a very well made product, a solid handle, strong spray and a long hose. You can't really ask for a better shower head in this price range."
1,"Adequate, barely","This is the second one we've purchased, and although it does the job, it's pretty limited. As far as the head goes, the massage and mist settings aren't useful, but it works ok as a regular showerhead. The real problem is that the hose they use now is way too rigid for the application. Even after a couple weeks, it still hasn't laid against the wall. If we had a showerstall, this would definitely be a problem. See the picture. Buying a better hose for $15 or more sort of eliminates the savings."
2,SIMPLY THE BEST,"Waterpik TRS-559 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower, Brushed NickelBought this, we installed it, and it is wonderful. Perfect for a standup shower, or just to take handheld and spray. Great for cleaning thebathtub too. A truly quality product.Rosemarie - Rhode Island"
2,A sense of assurance,"A friend gave me this book as a gift, as she continued to watch me struggle bouncing from relationship to relationship and freely giving myself when I shouldn't. This small 181 page book, allowed me to search into my soul & find what God was looking for: the true me...a Lady in Waiting.It's been five years since I was given this book, and I am now happily married and I have found my prince in shining armor. I gave my alabaster box to the Lord and he gave me the gift of true love. Praise God!This is a MUST read for all young women!!"
1,"Not a great movie, but interesting anyway.","It is a given that this movie is not the same type of movie that Scott Glenn did previous to it. Then again, not many movies can't compare to ""Silence of the Lambs."" After the first 15 minutes or so this movie becomes a lot better. Once Glenn finds himself on the Navajo Indian Reservation he becomes the typical fish out of water type character as he looks to return to Los Angeles with a suspected murderer, much like Val Kilmer's FBI character in ""Thunderheart."" Even that movie is far and above better than ""Shadow Hunter,"" but do not let this discourage you. It is a good rental, and you may never watch it again, but the mystical aspect of Native-American culture will suck you in. Enjoy!"
1,Poor Quality,I took my family's advice to go and shop on Amazon.com for the things I need everyday and am very disappointed. The shade is of cheaper material than dollar store napkins and half the size of my compact car's windshield. I will never buy from this buyer again.
1,Ghost,"I triedTo watch this movie six or seven times. It would not stream for me. I worked with amazon to resolve this problem, it did not work. I cancelled amazon prime."
2,Soppy but good movie!,I have seen this movie many times over the years and I still enjoy it. I miss Swayze. Whoopie made me laugh out loud.
2,THIS MOVIE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!,"I was one of those people who did not run to see this movie in theaters and waited many years to see it on video. I watched it again recently in my home theater and it holds up amazingly well. It has elements of romance,action,comedy,suspense and even horror! Yes horror! It may not be the gorefest we see now-a-days, but demons dragging their victim to hell after being impaled by a huge plate glass window falling like a guillotine through their chest qualifies in my book. The story is ingeniously written and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show and won a well deserved Oscar for her role as a ""psychic medium"" in this classic tale of greed, betrayal, revenge and unbound love! I have the older edition and the transfer looks excellent."
2,""" Ditto ""","Phenominally successful film, about a man named Sam , who is killed and begins his journey to solving his own murder , as a ghost. Simple plot , however , the story is told with a fantastic cast. Whoopie Goldburg gives an outstanding, Oscar winning, performance as the medium that helps , Sam , communicate and get his earthly revenge. Everyone says this is a great film. I say , ditto.Highly recommended drama."
1,Barely a Mention of Slavery!,How can a professor write a book about the Revolutionary War in South Carolina and not talk about slavery in some detail?....very bizarre.stay away and beware anyone who recommends this book..which at times feels like just a chronological list of battles over a 24 month period in South Carolina.
1,About the condition of this item.......,"I bought this movie for my daughter who had one when she was younger and it has somehow disappeared. She loves the story, characters, and music in the film. The thing I have issues with is the condition of the item. It was clumsily wrapped in plastic, the case is damaged and yellowed. If you are buying this as a gift, don't expect it to look new as it definitely doesn't. Since I purchased this as a Christmas gift, I went ahead and opened it to examine the film. It looks fine and plays properly; however, there are seven and one-half minutes of previews and COMMERCIALS at the beginning of the tape! I'm very disappointed with this purchase, but will keep it because I may not have time to order from somewhere else and receive it before Christmas."
1,Product is fine but the service stinks,"I ordered one of these for each of my 2 cars. The one for the Town Car is great, but they sent me the wrong one for the second car. I contacted them and am STILL waiting to hear from the company about getting the correct one."
2,Thought it was easy.,"I worked with it without reading any directions, so for this I give it a thumbs up. I do however wish I could have drawn a little more accurate with it (I am an autocad design/drafter) so if it would have been more autocad friendly that would have been nice. The only thing else I wish I could have done with the program, that I was unable to do, was design a screened in porch. The system allowed me to design a deck and an all weather room, but I could not get the look of a screened area. Overall I felt it was easy to use, teach and quick to design/redesign. The files take up very little space. I give it 4 out of 5 stars but have no other deck design program to compare it to, it is the only one I have ever tried."
1,Pale copy,Yeah this is a pretty bad album!I liked it when it came out but unlike Queen's albums this one got old pretty fast.It sounds a lot like THE WORKS queen's period-not the greatest either but...-without the magic and the inspiration.THE CROSS is a good rock and roll band and ROGER TAYLOR a great singer and composer but this album doesn't reflect any of those qualities unlike Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know and Blue Rock (2nd and third CROSS albums)Which are real cool energetic rock and not a pale copy of Queen.
1,Handle slides off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Used this for about 15 minutes before I noticed the black rubber handle sliding off the fiberglass shaft. Had to constantly smack it back into place just to get the job done. Returning item.
2,Superb!,"If you want to have an instant website without wasting a lot of time, this is the book for you. The CD takes you step by step to creat a fairly sophisticated website with input forms, scrolling/fly in text, differing themes, inserting pictures and video. etc. Using the CD, I really did not need the book all that much. Well worth it!!!"
1,Plagiate,"This book is a plagiate of Mika Waltari's book ""The Roman"" (original titel ""Ihmiskunnan viholiset"", published 1964 in Finland and translation in English published in 1966.SHAME ON SLATER!"
1,"Great for reference, horrible otherwise","This book was witty and a great reference for all things mid-century and female-oriented, but beyond that wasn't much of anything. Homosexuality is never really covered in regards to women and doesn't really analyze or comment on things or even try to understand the why behind it: the book is just sarcastic in a rather juvenile sense. The best part of the whole book is when Peril indicts Betty Friedan for being a part of the pink think problem.I actually got the impression from the book that if you happen to be a contemporary female who is feminine, you're evil. And that is sad."
1,Mislabeled--this is a cat toy,"While this is a nice toy, according to the packaging it is a cat toy, not a dog toy. Fortunately I was able to give it as a gift, but had purchased it for my puppy--not suitable at all. Orka toys are generally great, this one is just mislabeled."
1,wrong product,Product was the wrong adapter - could not get reimbursement - or rather get a return code to this date - very difficult to deal with the company - still no results in refunding.
2,Grease is the word.,"I wanted to see Grease because I was in love with Olivia Newton-John. I watched it at a friend's house and loved it all the way through. Great music and great scenes all the way through. Who could forget the race at Thunder Road and the dance off? Of course, the really big scene that stands out in my mind is when Olivia walks up in the skin tight black jeans. What a knockout. The first type of video player I ever owned was the old SelectaVision videodisks that were popular in the early eighties and Grease was one of the first movies I ever owned. I've probably never watched-with the exception of Star Wars-a movie as many times as I've watched Grease. I'm guessing that I've probably watched it about 50 to 60 times all the way through. I can't imagine anyone not liking it."
1,Not what was promised,"Original Review:I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised. After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up. Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.I guess what you see isn't always what you get. I'm sure the actual movie is fine. I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches. Maybe I should check that, too!Follow-up Review:Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange. She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved. As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift! I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it."
1,"Dopey movie, bad message","""Grease"" is a dopey movie, with silly jokes, innuendo, and fluffy songs. But this is only part of what is wrong with the movie. Worst of all is the message it sends: girls if you want to keep your boyfriend go lose on him. Sad that a movie like this is glorified so much."
1,DVD,The response was great and the shipping was great but the DVD was not in good shape. It fades in and out and is difficult to watch. But all and all it was ok.
2,Grease the Movie,"Christmas present for my daughter. She will love it. Looks great, speddy service and I am sure she will enjoy this a lot. Thank you."
2,"All movie preservation fans, do not get this movie in FS!","I warn you, they did not highly remaster the fullscreen version. i really recommend the widescreen. i bought the fullscreen version, since i own the ws version on video, so i thought that the fs version might look nice,... But oh well, grease on dvd in both formats is good. get the ws though."
2,screen vs. stage,"I really do like this movie. I've seen it several times and the 5.1 stereo sound is more than wonderful. The acting is very very good and the talent from every actor is exceptional and i'm a big fan of everyone in this really great musical.But,,,,,the stage production is 100 times better. For some reason the movie just went ""to"" Hollywood and it didn't have to. The Broadway version captured everything that it needed and all these extras were not really needed in the movie. Just once i wish Hollywood would take course 101 in ""Theatre."" Maybe we could get better directors, better producers. Again the film is great but if you have a chance to ever see the Broadway version do yourself a favor. Then write me back and tell me what you thought. I know you'll be more than impressed. At least Michael Douglas from ""Chorus Line"" isn't in this. Never-the-less this DVD is still worth the price."
2,happy,The item came in plenty of time for christmas. very happy with the product. looks great works great. Awesome. Thanks
2,Shows the real deal,"I like this movie because it portrays the true politics that went down when deciding who would break the color barrier in the major leagues. While I have nothing but the utmost respect for Jackie Robinson as a play and as a man, I know that Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige were arguably better choices if you were to just select the best ball player. This movie portrays how their shortcomings off the field prevented them from being that pioneer for Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers."
2,Second of two classic Christmas albums,"Buck recorded two Christmas albums back in the sixties. While I agree with most people that the first, Christmas with Buck Owens, is the better of the two, I don't think there's much to choose between them.The set opens with the title track, a fun song about all the gifts that Buck has bought. This is followed by more Christmas cheer, with Christmas time is near and Jolly Christmas polka.Then Buck completely changes the mood with All I want for Christmas is my Daddy. The song avoids explaining why Daddy is missing but the sadness of the little boy that Buck sings about is very clear.After that song, the Christmas cheer returns for the remainder of the set, with Merry Christmas from our house to yours, Good old-fashioned country Christmas and many other interesting original songs.For country music fans who want to get away from all the obvious songs, this set is ideal. But if you haven't got Buck's other Christmas album, buy that too."
1,Limited,"It is too small. It will barely accommodate a Chardonnay bottle, with no room for a cooling pack. It is too short for a Riesling bottle. Otherwise looks good."
1,a disappointment,"Sort of like a sausage with a lot of ingredients thrown together but no mixture. leftovers from various artists all put in the same album. No coherence at all. Big band, small combosYes it's Stan Getz and Miles Davis, but it's NOT Stan Getz with Miles Davis. I would love to hear both of these artists playing together, that isn't what's on this CD. Probably their egos were so big they couldn't both be in the same room with each other."
2,rubbish,"4 GB is amazing and although mine did not work, amazon sent me a new one, How is that for service! UPDATE: The second one lost its firmware and all my input plus the computer does not recognise it. I bought it for audible and I now have 13 months of books I cannot access."
2,I like it,"I just bought this a few days ago. Everything is fine, but the battery seems so short. I charged it with an AC adapter from gomadic and I definitely don't get 15 hours! I goes past the half way mark in about 3 hours and that is lame, but I do play around with it a lot. I also don't like the volume control. It's really hard to press and it should've just been part of the joystick."
1,Save your money,Save your money and buy an IPOD. This product doesn't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with. I sold mine on ebay.
2,"Small Player, Great Value","The Creative Zen V is very small in size, but large in value. It has a great scratch resistant surface and packs in a very nice GUI and features. Sound quality is excellent.See my full review of this player here: http://www.epizenter.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.21.1"
1,okay at first...,"So I got this as a christmas gift one year and was very happy with it. It's a great mp3 player with a good navigation menu (much better than a sansa or an iPod), good features, and great sound quality. It was all I just perfect for about the first year. Thats when the problems started. One day it froze up, but I reset it, no problem. About two months later it froze again. And again. And again. And again. Lately it won't even turn on long enough to hit the play button before it freezes. As one could imagine, it's completely useless now. I'm looking into replacing it with either a Sony Walkman or a Creative Zen (the new one, not a Zen V) and I hope whatever I decide on will be more reliable. Overall, I would not suggest this to anyone, because even though it seems great, the reliability of the software leaves something to be desired."
1,This is a really awkward peeler,"It is very uncomfortable.Too thick to hold, too gentle too peel.More like a toy that an appliance."
2,Swivel Peeler,I used this peeler on some apples and found it to be the best one that I have ever used! It made preparing apples for applesauce and apple pies and crisps so much easier and faster.
2,I love this peeler,"I owned another OXO peeler for about 10 years, which is why I purchased this one. I can't believe how much better it is! It works very smoothly & rapidly. Has a great grip, even if different from the other. With this one, the peels actually come off very thinly... making it more healthy as it leaves more of the nutrients, a huge thumbs up!Actually, I was just going tp replace my lost veggie brush... I use it all the time, and it just disappeared! ack!"
1,"Frustrating, dulls quickly","I have used this peeler only a few times and it is already quite dull. It is now practically impossible to peel an apple with it, although on straight peels, like carrots, it still works like any other mediocre peeler. Also, the ""swivel"" never really worked well. It was always difficult to peel a curved surface like an apple with this thing."
1,bulky,The blade is good but the huge handle makes it hard to use. Someone with small hands would find this very unweildy. I bought this to replace an old peeler of similar design but with just a simple metal handle. I shall be going back to using that.
2,Cuts time in the kitchen,This peeler makes fast work of carrots and potatoes. I make a lot of carrot juice and was looking for a peeler that would cut my time down in the kitchen. This peeler fit the bill. Definitely a good bargain and easy to use.
2,A TRULY UNIQUE AND MEMORIBLE BOOK!!!,"The Enchanted Castle was a great book with delightful characters that act out a memorible tale of magic, imagination, and mystery. My favorite picture in the book was the one of the children following the red string that is attached to the girl's finger. My favorite part in the book was when the girl claims that the ring makes it's wearer invisible, and then her fib becomes a reality. All in all, I think that this a book will be shared and passed down generation to generation"
2,Very Good just like the rest of the Series,"I really liked it, because almost all of my favorite characters were there. It was very dramatic and really pulls you in after the first couple of pages and you can't put in down because you want to know what happens to Bean, Petra and the rest of Ender's crew from the 3rd invasion. Both Bean and Petra come back but they are older and try tp fit back into their old lives where it seems they might not beable to. You meet Peter Wiggin(Locke) and the Parents of the Wiggin kids."
1,Why didn't somebody warn me?,"You loved Ender's Game, right?And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean. Terrific.Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books. The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. It hardly makes any sense at all. Beware!"
1,My Least Favorite Orson Scott Card Book,"This was my least favorite Orson Scott Card book to date, by far. I've read all the Ender's Series, the Shadow series up to the end of Shadow Puppets, and the Empire series.I could barely finish this book; it grated me. If it were a movie, only 40 minutes of 4 hours was any good. The only reason I finished it was b/c it's essential to understand the next book in the series.-Finished on 2012-08-27 (116,804 words in 7 days; 16,686 wpd)."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Bean, the Brother, and the woman.Card continues to explore his Enderverse, and this time the story is set after the war, and on Earth as Bean and Peter become deeply involved in the politics and plots of the time.Nasty conspiracies for all.Not as good as some of the others, but still a good book."
1,didn't care about plot premise,"I simply did not care what happened on earth in terms of political power. I care about Bean and his Jeesh. (For the record, where did this bizarre terminology come from--it wasn't in the Ender books, was it?) I want to understand how Bean is going to deal with the real world, as well as his classmates. I don't care who is in power on earth. And I thought the handling of Peter's parents was absurd! Plus, the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste. How did Achilles become so powerful? There is no clear explanation for this. It was a bad book. I hope the final 2 are better. Perhaps Card is out of ideas..."
2,Worthy of the Ender series,"Was closer to the Enders Game, Enders Shadow style of books made it a very fun read, again dealing with the children. If your familiar with the Enders series, this story is about "" Bean's"" battle keeping piece and trying to save the battle school children."
1,Missing something,"Never realized how much the The Real Wolrd benefits from having the hit songs of that time showcased in it. All those cheesy songs from the early 90's have been taken out of this edition, and replaced with really [bad] public serive announcement sounding music. This cast by far was the best, but even that doesn't carry the show with no real music behind them. Catch it in in reruns!!!!!!!"
1,NO MUSIC???,"I was about to purchase this DVD until I was informed that the original background music was taken out and replaced with something entirely different. Why?!? The first season DVD should have the original early 90's music, in which I love. So because it doesn't, I'm not buying the DVD. I'll consider buying this DVD set when the aforementioned mistake is corrected."
1,Who's idea was it to replace the original music?,"I am interested in the Real World San Francisco (season 3) but when I watch it on the MTV website, some fool decided it was a good idea to change the music! Fire that fool and bring back the original songs. The music plays just a big a part in bringing back those great memories of the early 90s and MTV real world and for me....playing lots of tennis and then coming in to watch Real World. What a stupid idea to change the music......moron."
1,marie Claire Idees,I ordered this magazine and never recieved a single issue. I never got a response from my complaint.
1,Coastline and Inland...,"I bought this CD hoping for peaceful shoreline sounds my infant could sleep to but was disappointed because after 20 minutes you don't hear the ocean at all; instead, it sounds like you're in the amazon listening to the local bird population. To be honest after hitting the ""bird"" section I always started the CD over and never found out if we return to the coast. If you are looking for authentic nature sound effects this is nice, but if you want a white noise wave CD you should find something else."
1,not in English,"Not really a review, I'm sure it's a fine book. The Item is listed on Amazon as being in the English language, but it is in Arabic. Please be aware."
2,"Nice, cheap product","I bought it for use with my Alias 2 phone. I needed the ""L"" jack because I wanted to put the phone in an arm band to listen to music while I worked out. I don't know if it is the phone or this jack (which is why I gave the 4 stars instead of 5) but if I have the jack plugged in all the way, I can only hear music out of one of my earbuds. I remedied this by wrapping a clear goody brand clear elastic around the jack so it doesn't go in all the way and I can hear out of both of the earbuds. The sound seems pretty good, and you can't beat the $3 for the adapter. Radio Shack wanted $10 for an adapter, and it wasn't even an ""L"" jack. I hope this helps!"
1,Does not work with blackberry 2.5 mm interface,"After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter,"
1,"Worse than a ""b"" movie",Not worth the time and trouble. Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter. Try Angel Blue for something in this same vein that is really a good movie.
1,My donkey could make a better airsoft gun,If you ever encounter this gun dont buy it go out to eat or save the money for something better I'm beggin you. Its not durable the scope is a plastic tube and the laser donsen't line up dont buy it
2,Velvet Underground,"This is the most underrated of all the velvet underground's albums and it just might be the best. Yes, its probably impossible to truely decide which one is the best because they are all fantastic, but this is a damn good one. Every song on the album is great. What Goes On is the most covered alternative song ever. Every alternative band that doesnt stink has covered it. Okay thats not true, but a lot of people cover it. Pale Blue Eyes is a mega classic, beginning to see the light rocks, its all good. This is one of the greatest albums of all time...blah blah. I was tired when I was writing this."
1,I would not buy from them again,I received Michael Kors Eau De Parfum 3.4 oz. It was wrapped in the box and looked new. However when I went to use it it leaked everytime I would spray it. Obviously it was tampered with- now I don't know what I'm spraying on myself. I will never buy from them again.
2,Well worth it!,"When I first considered this product, I thought that having a corer was unnecessary. I don't like having gadgets that only do one task, but this product has made any apple preparation an absolute breeze. It makes it easier to eat healthy and avoid the seeds. OXO makes quality goods, and this is no exception. I am happy with this product and would recommend it to fellow apple lovers."
2,Gets the job done,This works as good as any corer should. You don't have to push down to hard to get the result you want. The hole is wide enough to get everything out. Great product.
2,Apple Corer,I bought this apple corer so I could core my apples more easily than with a knife. It works as advertised so I'm happy! :)
2,THIS ALBUM IS A COUNTRY CLASSIC!,"Martina McBride's ""The Time Has Come"" is the best debut album ever. It is country in its purest forms. ""The Time Has Come"" is filled with awesome lyrics. My favorite tracks are: ""The Time Has Come,"" ""Cheap Whiskey,"" (with a message attached to it) ""Walk that Line,"" ""A Woman Knows,"" ""True Blue Fool,"" ""I Can't Sleep"" and the album's strongest work is ""That's Me"" in my opinion. Martina McBride is an amazing singer!! This album is a great introduction to her craft. Make sure you add this cd to your collection!"
1,Many problems,"I've owned this watch (the black one) for about a year now. I did not purchase the foot pod accessory.The watch has on 4 occaisions gone 'all black' lighting up every pixel on the face. When this happens you have to do a 'reboot' holding all 4 buttons down simultaneously until the watch resets. Of course all your data needs to be reentered.THe watch has also mysteriously reset to March 24, 2005 on 4 or 5 occaisions (10am I think). The time and date are all messed up but it keeps your personal info.The problem appears to be on the RS200 only. Check out the posts on runnersworld for many, many more disatisfied customers before making a decision on this watch."
1,Very cheap product,"I have owned older Polar hear rate monitors, my favorite was the S210. Is really cheaply made, belt is integrated into the watch, which is a very bad design, since the belt will be worn out with a year of usage. Overall, I think Polar products have gotten worse over the years. I am glad to see competitor like Garmin with much better products capturing the market they deserve."
2,"groovy, swinging jazz","Recorded live at The Bohemian Caverns in Washington, D.C., ""The 'In' Crowd"" is The Ramsey Lewis Trio at the peak of their eclectic but popular sound. It has the intimacy and spontaneity of music recorded live, but the precision of music played by those who have talent. A bit bluesy, a bit groovy, swinging, boppy jazz. It's good music for driving, for cooking dinner, as background at a party, and, most importantly, for listening to. There is a generous selection of samples on this site. Try the title track...if you don't like it, you won't like this CD. But if you do, keep going with the Tennessee Waltz, Love Theme from Spartacus, or Come Sunday. I defy your toes not to tap, you to not at least add this to your wish list."
2,Recommended,"While there were some rants that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I found myself agreeing to alot of what Maher had to say here. Written not long after 9/11 he has some great points about terrorism, national security and the way forward which, sadly, still ring true today (we've made a stunning lack of progress). It made me realize just how far we have to go.I recently read and reviewed America Alone (another book I really enjoyed, by conservative author Mark Steyn), which makes some of the same points that Maher, a liberal writer and pundit, makes in this book (which is to say the over-arching theme that too many Americans claim not to ""do politics""). But both authors argue it's not (solely) about politics. It's about waking up, not believing everything you're sold in the media, doing your own fact-checking and becoming an educated citizen of the world. It's an obligation, not a demand on your free-time.Some crass remarks and language, but otherwise recommended."
1,Disappointing,"We have only the paring knife from this set, and havebeen very disappointed with it. Our experience was almostidentical to that of Roy Sweeting, who has also reviewedit here. The knife lost its edge quickly, and worse yet,fell apart a few months after we bought it. The bladeseparated from the handle while cutting an apple."
1,Did Not Work,"I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad 1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else."
1,"THE ""GRESH"" who stole christmas","Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible. Gresh has no imagination in trying to figure out how future science may explain a superhero.If Gresh lived in the past, he would probably prove how electricity or flight is impossible or rockets or the internet. The original comics do a better job in explaining the heros.Dince Gresh likes cartoons better thean comic ""That's all folks"""
1,GET THE ORIGINAL HARRY POTTER SCORE!!!! ~NOT THIS!!!!~,"I have had ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"" original soundtracks for a very long while. And when I was at the store one day I spotted this soundtrack... it looked different from the others I had, and I (being a huge Harry Potter fan) decided to get these CD's. Okay... BIG MISTAKE! I'm sorry, but this revision of the wonderful Harry Potter music from the original soundtracks is just horrible! It sounds like the whole CD was played on a keyboard and not with real orchestral instruments. And the songs seem to repeat themselves over and over again just to make the whole CD last longer.Peice of advice: Get the original soundtracks and not this!"
1,"A great bit part for Jackie Chan, but a TERRIBLE movie!","The only reason to watch this movie is a pretty good acting performance by Andy Lau, a beautifully choreographed scene between Andy and Jackie, Sammo in a decent role, and the great Jimmy Wang Yu (one armed boxer, one armed swordsman) in a bit part. I thought the ending was just ridiculously stupid as was the entire movie.The commentary makes sure you will watch the dvd twice, but THAT IS IT!!!!! Commentary is not very exciting or anything btu is pretty good and is actually a tad more enjoyable than the movie itself. The guy who directed the Best of the Best movies does it and tells some prettty good stories."
1,Yuck,Tiny Tim was in my opinion a very talented individual but his talent seems sorely lacking in this rather sad collection of Christmas songs. The less serious songs are fun and entertaining but the more traditional songs are about as enjoyable as a root canal without painkillers.If you want a Tiny Tim album get one of his better efforts such as Girl or the import God Bless Tiny Tim.
2,Thanks For The Memories,"I used to watch I Spy when I was a kid and loved it. I sort of figured seeing it again after all of these years that it would be disapointing but I was pleasantly surprised by how well the show held up. Now, not every episode was a masterpiece but then again that's they way it is with all TV shows. When I was a kid I was sorry when NBC didn't renew the series for a 4th season ..... I'm still sorry."
1,Doesn't Quite Cut the Mustard,"The story is a fun one...It's quick and easy for parents to read to their child before bedtime. The illustrations are fun and keep the child interested. But, for the money you're paying for the book, I would like to have more content presented. The story is cute, but less than imaginative. I purchased the story based on Newsweek's recommendation. I do not concur. This is a waste of money to purchase. Check it out from the library. Reading it once IS definately enough."
2,Great fun book!,"I bought this book for my daughter in preschool and she loved it. My 6 year old grandson who has been held back in kindergarden read this book over Thanksgiving vacation with us that I gave him this book to take back home. He has read this book over and over to anyone who wants to listen to the story more than 10 times. This book has open the door to reading. This Christmas he is getting other David Shannon's books. I want to thank this book in helping to open the door to reading. My grandson who had no interest in words,but now wants to read to all who will listen!Thank You for opening the door for reading with my grandson"
2,Great product for the price,Easy installation and works great. The only thing that stops me from giving a 5 star rating is the base being square doesn't match the odd shpe of the base of my TV.
2,Favorite <3,"This is definitely one of those books that I would pick up and read at least once a year because it has the perfect mix of innocence and idealism. I've read this over 10 times and it still makes me go puppy eyed when my favorite couple are together~ Hands down, this is one of my favorite books of all time."
2,Anne of the Island,This third book of the series (Anne of Green Gables) is as good as the first and better than the second.
1,There was no Augustus Pelltier!,"Creating historical fiction is a fine art. Where history is known, it should be respected. The opportunity for the historical fiction author should be to fill in the blanks with supposition and to tie together events for the flow of the story. Or, if the work is really a fiction, loosely tied to a real event, that should be made PERFECTLY CLEAR to the reader. This book fails to accomplish either of these goals. There was no person by the name of Augustus Pelltier who accompanied the Corps of Discovery to the Pacific and back. Too many children will wind up with a strangely warped view of this American saga. The tale is so full of adventure and excitement that it easily stands on its own. If the author desired the viewpoint of a young person as the main character, she could have used George Shannon, Sacagawea or Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest REAL members of the expedition. Reader beware!!!"
1,Not too tempting to play again,"The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song, ""Bittersweet"" isn't available anywhere but on this import. The rest of the songs are a screechfest of constant high-pitched singing, and after 4 songs of the same, my nerves started to fray. Some of the other stuff is too Goth to be likable for my tastes.To be fair, ""The Heart of Everything,"" their other album, is superior to this one. I enjoy hearing that one often.All in all, I instantly imagined Within Temptation to be the perfect music vehicle for any of Stephanie Meyer's vampire romances."
1,Needs a new singer,"I gave this a 2 star rating because Sharon den Adel can not sing. This would be a perfect band if they found a new singer, this album is horrible with her. I thought she sounded decent on one song and she's not that great on the first album either. She sings off key all the time (especially when she starts singing high) and I have no idea why this got such a good rating."
2,Comfortable and stylish!,"For the price, this is exactly what I wanted and needed. It is super comfortable and has just enough pockets for my computer, headphones, water and books."
2,Form your own opinion,"this is my first time seeing this movie and I was blown away by the performances. Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor, wish we could see more of him. when the movie came out, i think on hbo, there was a negative critique given to this movie from a magazine that I supported. because of the critique, i wouldn't give this movie the time of day. i must say how wrong they were!!! this is an excellent movie and i no longer go by the reviews of others, i form my own opinion. will definitely add this movie to my collection."
2,Best gloves you'll ever buy,"these are the third pair of gel proframers ive bought. i am rough with my hands at work and have gone through other gloves in weeks, but i love the feel and the fit that the 150's give the wearer. its like having another layer of skin but tough as nails. love this hand saving glove if you work with your hands ( I mean really work with your hands ) then these are the gloves for you..."
1,A Waste of Time,"The best thing I can say about this title is that it is better than nothing. These contracts are short and lacking in any real substance. Moreover, there is no analysis whatsoever regarding key contract provisions. Buy ""This Business of Music"" instead."
1,does not work for phone calls,The microphone howls as soon as the phone connects to thenetwork. Works great for games or radio.
2,Where did I miss this one?,"I'm not sure how this work passed by me. Four classic Kingtales with numerous Dark Tower allusions, this is a must havefor all Stephen King fans. Its audio only, but the narrationis excellent. Sorry, no Frank Muller, but the reading is ofgreat talent.Someone help me out, when were these stories written? Are theynew, or recycled previously published as in Everythings Eventual."
1,Movie Mickey Blue Eyes DVD,"Bought this movie because I like it, but it won't play in my DVD player. I was warned when I purchased it that it was region specific, however I thought it would play on Australian equipment. Very disappointed."
1,Waste of Popcorn,"I saw this movie at the cinema. Having enjoyed other Hugh Grant flicks, I didn't expect this movie to be the total stinker it turned out to be. I thought Grant and Jeanne Triplehorn were a mis-matched couple. The acting was so-so, the plot very thin, and the humour strained. Overall, this movie wasn't worth the price we paid to see it, and I have no desire to ever watch it again."
1,"ABC ? It must stands for ""A very Bad book on C !""","Contrary to what the title of this book implies, this is one of the worst book I've ever read, and I regret I bought the book. Let me tell you a story. As a college student I had some difficulties finding a good grip on C's complexities so I just did my best to pass the subject and forget all about C. Now as a professional, I must learn the language and searching for a book to teach me quickly, I UNFORTUNATELY stumbled on this book and after browsing through the pages, I was more confused than ever. The teaching style is TERRIBLE ! Alhough I learned a thing or two, it took me sometime, definitely NOT A TUTORIAL ! NOT FOR BEGINNERS ! For those wanting to learn C the SUREST and FASTEST way, I highly recommend ""THE C PRIMER by Les Hancock and Morris Krieger"". Kelley and Pohl maybe knows C, but they definitely do not know how to teach the language !"
2,Get Read Great Information,"This is a great book that you cannot put down. The author does an amazing job telling the story of Isadora's life and giving the picture of the importance of her work in its historical context. I learned so much about her life, her work and importance of it related to what we see as modern dance and theater."
1,Don't waste your money,I just bought 4 guitar christmas albums. I almost threw this out the window. Pure garbage. Do not waste your money on this.
2,Awesome!,"This book is awesome! Although I have to admit, that some books are better, say ""Rilla of Ingleside"". I've recommended the ""Anne"" series to all my friends and they've promised me that they'd read it, for my sake. Even my librarian is as desperate as I am trying to find the rest of the books in the series. ""Anne of Ingleside"" has it's ups and downs but mostly it's all ups!"
2,I found myself when I read this book.,"This insightful, tender novel really touched on my feminine side. It is the story of the spunky Anne and her adventures in dealing with the twins, her school, and her best friends. Yes, I know, it is hard to be a 16 year old male avid L.M. Montgomery fan, but without her books, I would never have realized the world of wonder attached to novels commonly thought of as ""girl's literature."""
1,The worst audiobook ever,"We have listened to dozens of audiobooks and thoroughly enjoyed the experience but the stacatto, monotonous narrative style of Susan Omalley is the worst I have ever heard. A third grader could read this book better than she does. Do not buy this audiobook. You will only regret the purchase."
1,Self-Serving,"Reading the book was slow and painful. I'm sure Arthur is a very nice man and honest, but did he have to go on for over 200 pages making that point. I think he wanted this book to be a learning experience for the reader, but unfortunately it turned into a self-serving narrative about the things he could not fix and his buddies.Maybe next time."
1,Too Little Too Late,"First of all, readers will know most of the information in this book by reading the headlines in recent newspapers. The behind-the-scenes material is interesting, but it is so weighted in the author's favor that it lacks a sincere element of truth. Instead of writing a book about what investors don't know about Wall Street, I wish Arthur Levitt would have spilled the beans while he was the SEC's chairman. To make money by writing a book based on what he should have told investors long ago does not sit well with me. As an investor, I feel cheated and as a reader of this book I felt like the message was too little, too late!"
1,A Sleep Aid,"First, investors as a group are not going to take on Wall Street. The idea is unrealistic and the information in this book does not meet the muster of news anymore, because most of it has already been reported. The writing style is boring and slow to the point of sleep. I regret buying the book!"
2,Drifting Away,"The drifting music ofLaura (Fox Film Noir)melts us into the portrait of a murdered beauty. We are infatuated. Vincent price walks into the scene and all we see is his usual handsome, tall and most charming presence. Judith Anderson claims your attention as she did in another unforgettable movie ""Rebecca."" Laura is cool and ravishing.After all though, I was subdued by Clifton Web, as the splendidly audacious Waldo Lydecker. His words are choice and sautéed in lemon juice; a wonderful contrast to Laura. I must agree with him, when gum-chewing Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson has become infatuated with the portrait of Laura, he sneers ""Have you ever dreamed of Laura as you wife, sitting by your side at the policeman's ball or in the bleachers... or listening to the heroic story of how you got a silver shinbone from a battle with a gangster? (pauses) ...I see you have."" Laura's image does not transform into a housewife."
2,Lovely Laura!,"My daughter Laura suggested I try to locate a copy of this old film, informing me she'd never seen it. She enticed me to do a quick scramble to find ""Laura"" by saying we could watch it together when she visited during the holiday season. On Christmas night we treated ouselves to freshly popped popcorn, soda, individual boxes of candies, then dimmed the lights and watched ""Laura"" with our Laura! Was new to her; brought back memories for me!"
2,Fantastic Film! Fantastic Seller!,This is a favorite of mine. I think most people would agree. The Amazon seller represented the product accurately. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.
2,"By far, the best movie I've ever seen","This is a beautiful movie. The acting is beautiful. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is beautiful. Tim Roth is one of the most amazing actors, and his performance as 1900 is absolutly astounding. I highly recommand you buy this wonderful film"
2,The Legend of 1900,"The Legend of 1900This is an Amazing movie! Fantastic music, incredible story, great acting and beautifully produced. Well worth watching."
2,Recieved in time Great movie,Love the Movie great story line good music kind of historical in a way back to the early part of the 20th Century
2,satisfied customer,"I recently purchased a used video of, The Legend of 1900. It was in perfect condition and was shipped on time and safely packaged. I will use Amazon in the future."
1,Didn't meet expectations,"This book is OK at best. I was looking specifically for some guidance in process definition and had high expectations for this book, especially because it's published by Addison Wesley. Unfortunately, I really didn't get much out of it. There's one thing, however, that just about drove me batty -- Caputo spends a great deal of time developing ""striking analogies to dance."" I found this rather useless. As a typical software professional, am I expected to gain insight into the items being presented with the help of a comparison to an unusual profession? Analogies can be used to aid understanding when the analogy maps the new concept onto one the audience is already familiar with. The space taken to make the constant comparisons could have been better used to provide additional annecdotal evidence."
1,"""Dude, Where's My Car"" was better","Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year. It really was that bad. Lacking any character development, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters and considered turning it off half way through. This movie is a piece of garbage. It's got Sylvester Stallone in it and its out on dvd and it's a piece of garbage."
1,Release the Director's Cut,"With Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin behind the wheel, you would expect ""Driven"" to be more entertaining than it actually is. The deleted scenes on the DVD give you a taste of what might have been. A ""director's cut"" is definitely in order."
1,Absolute junk!,"Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock."
1,Okay but not cigar,"First off I want to say that this movie was not all that it was hped up to be. My family has been involved in the racing business for many years now and this movie just stinks. The FXs are okay, but you do not hear of a car flying throught the air at a track crashing in a pond ,then exploding, and then having other drivers make a 180 on the track and go back and help. This movie is a waste of your money. Save your money and go buy some beer and have a better time."
1,I watched this on a recommendation ......,"Somebody recommended this wonderful piece of tripe to me as a good movie, and now I wish them bodily harm. The special effects were pretty good, but they don't save the outrageousness of the acts being commited in the movie. Add that to the lousy acting by just about everbody in the film, and you have a bonified loser of a movie. I wish I could give this movie negative stars.After watching this wonderful piece of garbage DVD, I watched the deleted scenes. It then made perfect sense to me why Stabone was in charge of the screenplay. He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written, as a bad person. Stabone always has to play the hero. What an ego, somebody should call him and let him know that he's no longer ""cool"". Oh wait, was he ever?"
2,Feel the wind.,"A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top.A race scene is very exciting. Especially, driving on a public way is unblievable.Indeed, a story line is poor, but you must be satisfied only with the racing scenes.I think acting is good. You won't be disappointed.Thank you."
1,Stallone is Provolone -- CHEEZE -- BAD FOR THE SPORT,"I have never been witness or had to sit through a more painful 88 minutes. I'm a racing fan, but this flick did nothing but denegrate the sport to the level of smut. Stallone clearly didn't have a knowledge of the sport nor did the director possess the intelligence to understand how to visually leverage the spectacle, technology and thrill that open-wheel racing delivers to fans around the world. It is an embarassement to the sport. They should ban these people from any race tracks."
1,Racing for Soap Opera fans,I did not like this movie at all. I thought that I might like it when I saw the previews. It was like a bad soap opera combined with a music video.
1,"It's not ""Rocky""","Sly Stallone wrote this script, but he also wrote the script for Rocky. It wasn't a brilliant one, but at least Rocky was a much better film that this total waste of film.This movie has no redeeming qualities to it, I can't even think of one reason why I would recommend it. I thought it was boring, and the race car sequences were just okay.Stallone tried to throw romance(lame try) and action and sports together. I think he was trying to appeal to everyone, but I don't think it appeals to anyone. This movie was badly acted, and the script was awful(Rocky script was much better), and it has been done far too many times before.Skip it..and watch Rocky again."
1,"ok movie, but the dvd skips","The movie is ok i guess it won't win any awards and story is very weak, but the race scenes are good but the movie skips I bought one and then took it back and exchanged it and skiped in the smane place i tried it in two players. Don't buy it it will skip and you may not as lucky as i was too get your money back after youve tried two dvds."
1,Drivel,"I totally disagree with the opening statement that all racing movies are ""clunkers""....despite their faults, Grand Prix and LeMans are classics for their riveting analog real time footage..but Driven? aside from some real time CART clips from the 1999 season, the movie is totally preposterous, the special digital effects are ludricrous, the story is ridiculous, the acting is incredulous...this makes ""Days of Thunder"" look like ""Lawrence of Arabia""!!....just watched it again the other day and it's only gotten worse...ouch!!"
2,"Easy to grip, easy to scoop","This is an easy to grip, sturdy scoop. The handle is cushioned, which helps you get a strong grip. The scoop is well-built and feels sturdy in your hand. Because of this, it makes scooping even the hardest ice cream a breeze!"
1,FOR COLLECTORS ONLY,"This 1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others. Fortunately Bennie and Charlie Rouse returned to the studio several years later and recorded BACK ON THE SCENE for Blue Note. It is much the better of the two and is included in the 3 CD box set which gives you 5 LPs worth of music,including SOUL STIRRIN--WALKIN AND TALKIN and more."
1,Fogless? Not quite,"The mirror was in fact fogless for about 6 months, and I was satisfied. Now fogs immediately and is difficult to see in. I would have paid more for a product with a bit more longevity. Also feels flimsy, cheap."
1,just the pointed ends...,the tongs where hard to grip..so what I did to avoid sending them back.I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward..like a claw. Now they are excellent.grip great. love the long handle...and heavy duty soft rubber.hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back.
1,This Movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO overrated!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is SOOOOOOOOOO bad! By far, the most overrated movie of the 70's. What's the big deal? And how many times can you say ""Shark attack! Get out of the water!"" in five minutes? Well, find out when and IF you rent this crap, even though everyone of Earth has seen it already.They don't show the shark until 5 minutes to the end of the movie, either! Every time a scary or suspenseful part comes, it turns out to be a fish or something in the water, but not the shark.The sequels are the same exact thing, too. Just Roy what's-his-face in a boat looking for the shark, that Jaws 2. Jaws 3 is just a stupid attack on Marine SeaWorld by a shark looking for its babies and Jaws: The Revenge was actually pretty cool because that's the one you saw the shark the most and there's a lot of gore and action. If you're going to see any of these movies, see Jaws: The Revenge. DO NOT SEE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dolby Digital or DTS?,"My receiver and DVD player are capable of both Dolby Digital Decoding and DTS. I want to find out which Jaws DVD to purchase, Dolby Digital or DTS? Please help!I am also curious about the Apollo 13 DVD. Same Question, DD or DTS?Thank You - JimmyDuniay@aol.com"
2,Jaws (The best film of our time),"This is the best film of this generation, based upon the novel by author Peter Benchley and directed by the most successful director of our time, Steven Spielberg.When the small summer island resort town of Amity is set upon by a twenty-five foot man-eating great white shark, Chief of Police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), an old shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw), and ichthyologist Matthew Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) set off on an uncharted, desperate quest to destroy the marauding killer embodying three tons of instantanious white death. A 100% must-see classic from Universal Pictures. If you don't own this movie yet or haven't seen it quite yet (which I very highly doubt), watch this awesome thriller!"
2,Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition),The movie was in excellent condition and I received it very quickly (just a few days after my order was placed).
2,My fav movie,"This is my favorite movie because it's a shark eating people... this movie is scary enough to keep you out of the ocean. If you watch this on a BIG BIG BIG screen TV, it is AWESOME! My fav scene is when Jaws eats her way through the boat."
2,One of the best,"Jaws is one of my favorite movies of all time, everything about it is fantastic. I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to!"
2,Solid Peeler,"I purchased this peeler because my flimsy Victorionox $3 peeler's blade snapped right off. I received recommendation of this peeler being ""the best peeler invented"" by a fellow chef. I was not disappointed at all, the blade is sharp, the handle is comfortable and it flies through potatoes and carrots. I have even been told it lays waste to coconuts. If you're looking for a reasonably priced peeler, look no further."
1,A shame to kill so many innocent trees.,"This book is flat out too long. The author's argument is simple. So simple, in fact, that this would have made an excellent journal article. Instead, the author drags it out, and drags, and drags, and drags and...you get the idea. Read the book reviews instead. You'll save yourself a few hours."
2,Have read for English 102,"This isn't my first choice type of book, but it's pretty good. Hard part trying figure out how to write research paper on it"
2,Good reference material,"This book was great for what I wanted it for, being a film student I felt it would be nice to have something to look back at anytime I forgot something when I am done with school. This book is a good source for a reference for refreshing your self or for learning something you didn't know!"
1,Can anyone on the planet explain this CD???,"Perhaps I am insane, but can anyone explain how any of these songs/titles have ANYTHING at all to do with either the book or the movie??I have gone to several sites & the same songs are listed with this album. I just don't get it. ""who let the dogs out!!???""Can anyone explain how these songs have anything to do with John Williams or fantasy themes? One review on another site talked about John Williams being a big composer of fantasy themes, but it just doesn't fit. The sounds clips are the original versions of the songs. They aren't adapted to sound like fantasy type music. Has anyone found any sort of place that explains all of these songs or why they are on a CD with the words ""Harry Potter?""...and what's with the Philosopher's stone instead of Sorcerer's Stone? Did I miss something or does the book have a different title in other parts of the world?Very perplexing."
2,The forgotten George Montgomery...at last!,"Like many now past middle age, I grew up watching Westerns starring George Montgomery, Audie Murphy, Joel McCrea, and Randolph Scott. Montgomery's were not quite on the same level as the Scott and McCrea oaters, but they were always entertaining. CANYON RIVER is solid entertainment, good action sequences---no, THE SEARCHERS or RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY it is NOT, but fun, nevertheless, and maybe a bit nostalgic. Recommended."
1,very light in content,The book is very light in content and written with a very narrow approach. If you want to learn anything about real estate don't buy this book.
1,Very disappointing product.,"I thought buying OEM would be better than one of the clones. This battery isn't any better than the original battery that came with my phone 2 years ago. I don't use my phone much, but I'm having to recharge this battery every other day. I didn't make a good choice on this one."
2,SPANISH MADE EASY,After having formal Spanish in high school which was totally useless Spanish Step by Step was directed at people needing conversational spanish and not formal Spanish which noone speaks anyway. Great book for people needing to do a quick study for trips not to far in the future. Also for people needing to deal with Spanish speaking people in the job market or a business enviroment this book is a must!
1,Garbage,"I also can't beleive Coleman would put out something like this. Blows cold air and now I will lose out on my shipping cost because I beleived in the Colman name and have to send back. It does nothing!! Well ,it does blow frosty air at you."
2,works great! but you need to read the directions...,"Like the other users that have commented here, I was initially very disappointed. However, as I was grumbling and about to throw away the user guide, I decided to (gasp!) read it. Turns out the on/off switch is a 3 position switch, marked with 3 symbols: A Roman numeral I, A Roman numeral II, and a 0 (Zero). So, I thought that zero was OFF, and number I would be LOW and number II would be HIGH. Turns out that number I is AIR ONLY and number II is AIR + HEAT. After trying it out on II, it was nice to discover a decent amount of heat coming out. I installed 3 of them on my daughter's Blazer, since there are three large pieces of rear glass that are always fogging up, and these 3 units perfom pretty well. Not hot enough to pose a fire hazard, but warm enough that after 5 minutes of operation, there is about a two foot circle of clear glass, and here in Alaska, that isn't too shabby."
1,Piece of Trash,"This book ""Doing Battle , The Making of a Skeptic"" is really bad. Don't waste your money or your time. Borrow it from the library if you want to read it. I accidentally borrowed this book and another of his books ""BAD or, the Dumbing of America"" from the library at the same time. I was appalled at how bad both books were."
1,Broke in the first week,"I bought this to help me open jars as I have tendonitis and have difficulty. While I was unsuccessfully trying to open a pickle jar, it slipped out of my hands, fell on the floor and broke.Give me the old fashioned kind any day."
1,Doesn't open everything,"I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed. It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble. The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket. I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star."
2,"What a relief, er, release!","Finally broke down and bought one of these gadgets after graduating to a hard cast on my hand for torn ligaments. The initial first use was tricky, but with careful patience, it worked great! And continues to do so. All the rubber grippers, etc. -- including from my arthritis doctor and the hand specialist -- are no longer cluttering my kitchen; this is the only tool I need. The man of the house also likes it, and it withstood his first use of manhandling just fine."
1,oxo good grips jar poor product,I previous had a similar jar opener and have 2 places and wanted to keep one in one place and the other in another. This jar opener is an inferior product and the worse thing I ever purchased from Amazon(and I purchased numerous things)It doesn't grips all jars and it should have advised me of what it was made of.It looked various similar to the other one I own and I can't wait till I can find another jar opener like the other one so I can throw this one in the garbage.
1,The third dimension is NOT terror... its stupidity!,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS. It's stupid, the mechanical shark looks like a giant piranha, and its just boring. It's set in seaworld Florida. Whatever happened to Amity island?This peice of junk is pathetically unsuspenseful. Hello, where has John Williams got to? Not once did I hear the JAWS theme.The only good thing about this movie is the gore. That's it.A cheap waste of money. Oh, and by the way, I'm not even going to bother writing a review for JAWS revenge because its even rubbisher than this one!!!!!"
1,A bomb,"I loved the first 2 Jaws films. As a child I saw this one also and it scared me, I was in the video saw and decided to rent it. Definatly nott as scary as I remember there were quite a few laughs, unintentially I am sure. the 3D effects were just laughable I had a good time watching it but don't expect to to be horrified."
1,Not good at all...,"This movie is so awful that you have to see it! The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws. Jaws 3 was way to long. The photography was so bad that you couldn't tall if someone was dead or alive. You had to guess. If you don't like blood, don't see this movie. Unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 this movie has the dead people on the screen for a fairly long period of time. After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the director, Joe Alves. The acting was alright, it was just the photography, the plot and the lack of the Jaws theme song (it was only used once) that made the movie so bad. However, I do think you should see it just so you can say you've seen all three Jaws movies."
1,A Toothless Sequel,"The nicest thing I can say about ""Jaws 3"" is that it makes me appreciate Spielberg's original 1975 classic even more. Everything about this movie is terrible, from the writing, to the acting, to the awful special effects. The movie drags endlessly, lacks any real excitement, and is poorly paced. What was Carl Gottlieb thinking when he co-wrote this film? And why would Louis Gossett, Jr. sign on to make a movie this bad right after his Oscar-winning role in ""An Officer and A Gentleman?""Most of the visuals look cheesy, and the fact that the film is set in Sea World doesn't help. In the fifties, most 3-D movies were pretty bad, with only the 3-D gimmick to attract audiences, and ""Jaws 3"" is no better. Even its 3-D effects are weak. This is one of the most poorly conceived sequels I've ever seen. Perhaps if you're an avid ""Jaws"" fan, you may enjoy this somewhat. As a fan myself, it makes me wish I were watching the original ""Jaws"" instead."
1,Second Jaws sequel is dull but has some redeeming qualities.,"The 2nd Jaws sequel is definetely not the worst, Jaws The Repulsive, I mean Jaws The Retarded, oops I MEAN JAWS THE REVENGE IS!!!!!!!! Jaws 3 has a great musical score, nifty plot, and a few dramatic moments, BUT... none of the characters are really engaging. You don't care about them as people so the movie is dull. Atleast the film is original. The plot centers around Brody's son Michael(Quaid) and his job at seaworld in Florida. Roy Sheider is sorely missed."
1,What a bunch of grapes!!!,"First there was God, then Spielberg came along with Jaws...that's where it all should have ended. Jaws II was..not exactly bad but it wasn't that great either..Roy Scheider does a decent job and the shark...well..it's a shark.. But then came this one. I first saw it when I was a kid, and while the two first ones scared me, I laughed out loud after this one. Extremely bad special effects and above all a plot as thin as paper. Wow..a shark is in our backyard pool..how can we kill it..I know..let's go down in the water. Poorly equipped..DUH I'm sorry if I offend anyone who liked this poor sequel but I can't help but hate it."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,I ordered Jaws 3 and I could only play Jaws the original. I was ripped off!! Don't order this unless you want Jaws 1
1,"Very, very bad","Where do I begin? This movie was awful...I had morning sickness that wasn't this bad.If being a ""ham"" were an Olympic event, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett, Jr. would sweep the gold medals for this ball of cheese. Dennis Quaid would pull a close second for his amazing performance as a caring boss and drinking buddy/older brother. (Has Dennis Quaid been in a movie in which drinking wasn't his main talent?)Anyway, go to the beach, but stay away from this video."
1,I'm amazed,"Jaws 1 was a great movie....Jaws 2 still felt like a jaws movie because all of the original characters are there except for of course Quint and Hooper...But I am amazed at the ""good reviews"" this movie is getting!! The plot is silly ""MAMA IS MAD!!"" and the horrible special effects...a shark swimming backwards?? Throw this in the recycle bin and hit delete...this movie was embarrasing!!"
1,THE worst movie ever,I guess I have to give it a score! Terrible special effects and really bad acting.What were they thinking? A paper shark drawing by a 3-year old? Did the producers run out of money and couldn't come up with anything else?This movie is an insult to Spielberg who directed the original jaws.One star because I have to give something. Otherwise it will be -5 stars. Just terrible!
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,This was the worst movie ever created. I could have made better movies with crayons and glitter. Don't spend a dime buying this piece of garbage. I would rather watch paint dry than endure this swill. Thank God there is no Jaws 4.
1,Sucks Completly,"Here is a perfect example of griding a story into the dirt. The acting and story line are so bad in this version, you'll wonder if this movie was really a cult classic in the making."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"When this film came out I thought great. I always been an Arnold fan, but boy was I wrong. I wasted 6.50 on a real sleaper. The only guy who made the movie ok enough not to snore in the theater was the guy who played satan. From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance. The taking out of scriptures was real bad."
2,First film Arnold Schwarzenegger did after his heart surgery.,"Another good Arnold Schwarzenegger film. This time he plays a man who must fight the devil and win before the clock strikes midnite and it becomes the Year 2000. Not a blockbuster, but it will hold your attention. This was the first film Arnold Schwarzengger did after a two-year absence after having heart surgery. In the Bonus Materials section of this DVD, is ""Spotlight On Location"", a behind-the-scenes look of the film and why they cast who they did. A Feature Commentary with Director Peter Hyams is available. If you like to know the secrets of special effects, for example, was it a real train and how did it do that, all the secrets are revealed here of many special effects throughout the film. For those who have a bibical understanding, the entire ""Book Of Revelation"" from the Holy Bible is condensed and simplified here in its symbolic form."
2,VERY good movie.,"Okay...this had to be one of Arnold's best movies, so therefore I'm going to buy it on DVD when it becomes available. There were some great scenes, especially the ending in the little underground chapel. But it seems weird...think of it. A Bunch of priests, and a whole on-line community? Oh well, its only a movie. There was however one REALLY upsetting scene involving Arnold's family..for those that hvae seen it, you know what I mean, that I, nor anybody else in the theatre erally enjoyed. It was too...bad. But this movie has great special effects, the story seems intact, and the cast lives up to the story as well. This is a must see movie."
1,TERRIBLE--RUN AWAY!,"A complete waste of money, not even worth seeing. Not even worth one star--but Amazon.com doesn't give an option for no stars."
1,This movie was really bad...,"Sorry, but I thought this movie was horrible. Only two other movies are on my list for horrible movies, and this is one of them. Schwarzenegger was completely mis-cast in this movie. The acting was horrible. I can't believe Gabriel Byrne wasted his time on this movie. Save your money and spend it on Stigmata. It is a much better movie..."
1,Worst Schwarzenegger Movie Since Last Action Hero,"This movie started OK and then degenerated into a bunch of Action/Horror cliches Which left me fast forwarding to the end. By the end of this movie you don't care if the good guy's win, or die."
1,"Dont buy, rent if you really want to see it","While I did enjoyed the beginning of this, it soon got to the point that it was far to easy to guess everything about to happen, and I was fighting to stay awake watching it.Very sad also when the devil with all his powers, which he shows in the film, cant beat a drunk who wants to kill himself.One of the worst by Arnold."
2,most disturbing thing i ever saw,this film is the most disturbing thing i've ever seen. satan being in something is just gonna lead to foulness but this just went a little 2 far. arnold needs 2 re-team with james cameron for true lies 2 or terminator 3.
1,Unholy Mess,"First of all, I had assumed the movie I was seeing was the film rendition of Dennis Daver's fine novel of the same name. Alas, it was a hokey, rambling, unrealistic journey about prophecies and the Catholic Church and a lot of mumbo jumbo psychobabble.Arnold was...well, Arnold. He can occasionally shine (""True Lies"") but usually one gets a stilted, linguistically challenged portrayal of the same type character. In this he falls somewhere in between...as does the movie. You know from the first five minutes how it will end and while it is easily as good as most of the other tripe that passes for cinema these days, it is typical fare. Best time to see - when snowed in with nothing to do all day."
2,its hot,"if you want to twerk that thang, this is the cd to get. the beats are really hot, and full of booty energy. lyrics are great, as long as you aren't into the rap thats for the mind."
1,Watch out for film deposits under the glass!,"My six months old 4990 has a noticeable film deposits under the glass. The glass was clear when I bought it. Apparently other owners of the 4990 have had identicle problems (discussions at howtofixcomputers.com). Epson will clean it for free if the 4990 is still under warranty, but this is not a one time problem, but a continuous one (you have to pay Epson to clean the glass after warranty expires). The film is visible when the 4990 is powered up and the interior light is on. With the lid out of the way, look at the glass at 10 to 30 degrees angle. I hope your glass is clear."
2,Epson minus Canon=New Top Of Line Scanner,"With the discontinuation of Canon's popular and highly rated Canoscan 9950 F, the Epson 4990 is by default the new flatbed color scanner champ. I don't think I'm just going to wait while Canon gets around to coughing up a new and persumably better successor to the 9950 F. What arrogance! I'm switching to Epson today.Canon=STUPID."
2,"Great Scanner, Even for the novice","Bought this scanner from amazon, and I can't express how happy I am with it. First ordered the scanner last saturday, and it arrived on Wed., this was with the free shipping. As for the scanner I have been playing around with slides, negative and older b/w photo's. No complaints, and some very nice scans. I like the ability to have a large scanning area. I have been placing multiple b/w photo's of different sizes in the film area, then individually crop the photo's. The digital ice has been very good on some of the pictures that have seen better days. I would highly recommend this scanner."
1,"Lame, c-grade ACDC crap","Great cover, but that's it. Nothing electrifying or rising above decent and ""nice try"" status. Get the 1st LP and continue with BREAKER on. A cute record if nothing else."
2,good solid album,If you like rainbow then you should like this one. Good production good songs great guitar playing. Not the best rainbow album but worth buying.
2,It worked,"I am not one who believes in these types of things but a friend convinced me to give it a shot. We needed to sell a house relatively fast because we were moving out of state. Our house was on market 3 days and we accepted an offer @ asking price. I tend to think it was setting the price right, my friend believes old St Joe was at work. Regardless, <$10 and a little faith never hurts."
1,Arrived in poor condition,"I purchased the St. Joseph home sale kit for a friend who has been struggling to sell her house. It wasn't an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless. However, the kit was shipped in an ordinary padded envelope and its little cardboard box didn't survive the rigors of the postal service. It was dented and smashed. In addition, the cardboard packaging looked like it had been exposed to moisture, it was slightly puffed in areas and looked old and used. Overall the kit that I received was not in gift-giving condition although the contents were unharmed. It was very disappointing."
1,Didn't work,"I got this silly plastic statue because I had heard it brought good luck in selling houses. I knew it was just a wives tale, but I figured it couldn't hurt. It's cheap and it's plastic, but I wasn't expected much more then that based on the description. We were trying to sell our house in a hurry and it didn't happen for us as quickly as we needed it to. Granted, winter is not the best time to list a home...but if you are buying it for the hopes of 'helping' for a quick sale, save your money and just cross your fingers. (Or list it in the spring at a good price!)"
2,This Fork is Good for a Dork,"This cooking utensil is unlike any other. its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude. Little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well. say, for example, that your meat is not turning out well at all, infact it doesn't seem to look like meat anymore just crap, well with this fork you can whack the meat, stab it, and then hurl it across the yard and, trust me, you'll feel much better."
1,NOKIA BATTERY,I bought 2 units Nokia Lithium Ion 1000mA Battery for Nokia 6300/8200 andreceived a Nokia BLB-3 that does not fot on the my cel phonesRegardsDavid Lebed
2,Great Value,"I bought this looking to replace another thunderstorm CD that was just too loud and startling. At the price, I wasn't expecting much, but it's wonderful. Soothing waves, gentle thunder and no new age music."
2,The first of a line of fantastic records by the Jam,"The amazing thing about this record is its deceptive simplicity. It has all the halmarks of punk, 3 chords and attitude, but it has deep intelligence, pop reference and lays the ground work for the true Jam materpieces such as Setting Sons and Sound Affects. It's 1998 and I still listen to this great punk album in my car!"
2,This is where it all started!,Weller 18 a 60s obsessed mod teen takes speed sees the Pistols live and combines his love for soul and R&B with the fire of the who and the emerging punk scene. Is it a great record?- no but its a vital energetic youthful stab of music that would begin the career of the Uk's best songwriter youth icon. Plus there are some great tunes In the City Away from the numbers etc. This is a snapshot of London circa 1977 and though never punk Weller was the essential rebel and no one looked better and more determined than Paul. The Jam were to become the essential British rock band outside of the Clash and weller has gone on to this very day to be one of the best songwriters of our Generation. And better still the Jams legacy is untarnished and still sounds refreshing today!!!
1,This Product SUCKS!,I threw them out! the most cheaply made piece c..p I ever had. Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
1,Out of subject,"This book concentrates on c++, but it doesn't mention much about C++ Builder. I do not recomended it, if you want to learn Borland C++ Builder."
1,Poorly written but I find the subject thought provoking,"I have read 6 of the 8 in the series, the author does a very good job of bringing the books and characters together. To a normal HS Educated reader that has served any time as a Grunt they will be slow but enjoyable. To the Elite it will be jibberish."
2,Good Read,"Just falls short of being called a classic, but nevertheless an excellent read and gathers pace as one reaches the end. I found it very contemporary, almost everything ""modern"" is discussed or inferred to, be it drug use, incest, toy boys or sexual ambiguity. No wonder it still retains its freshness. I think this is a must read.Loved when the wife says that they can ""fly"" back to San Francisco - remember the story takes place in 1932!! Lovely"
2,"Yes, You Can Judge an Album by Its Title (and Cover)","A mesmeric work by an unlikely leader. Oliver Nelson hadn't recorded anything that hinted at this achievement, and he didn't near it again. This may be Freddie Hubbard's finest moment, and Bill Evans and Paul Chambers are surpassing. The compositions are complex and accessible. As a special bonus, this edition has the strikingly original original cover art title, and the record is aptly and eloquently titled."
1,Having it both ways,"As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others."
1,Lots of stains not listed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I'm not very good with laundry. It turns out that every time I've referenced it, the stain I'm looking to treat isn't included. For instance, GRASS STAINS! Where is that??? Anyone who has children would look for this first, yet it's not even in there. There are many common stains that aren't even listed. I wouldn't recommend this book; and I'm surprised that Oprah did."
2,VERY EXCITING MOVIE,I thought this was a really good movie. The woman was very beautiul. I got excited watching her.I felt sorry for the man though.
1,YeePee...PORN with a PLOT ! ! !,"*BASIC INSTINCT: Unrated Director's Cut*Wow, I don't remember this movie being so pornographic. I guess the Director's Cut, with the extra 5 minutes, is nothing more than extra porn. I remember it's what made Sharon Stone so popular? This would have made her a legend if it was released this way. From graphic oral sex(Michael on Sharon) to a near rape scene, this movie is just too much for me. The main story is great, with a great twist for an ending(or non-twist, depending on how you look at it) however, the graphic sex-scenes are just not neccessary and are way too overboard(I can't help but wonder if Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas are still proud of their work on this film?).Go ahead and call me prude, but I cannot recommend this filthy trash."
1,What is this?,"In the city I live in, such a noisy fuss was made about it that many people including myself went to see what caused such excitement. Indeed the fuss-makers should pay me what I paid for the ticket, as the story is no different from any ordinary paperback. Amazing to see some guys writing comments in this column admire Sharon Stone as if they have never seen a naked woman on screen before. Garbage movie, and the ones that think this one deserves to get five stars are completely unaware of the meaning of ''entertainment''.IT DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR AT ALL - I COULD GIVE IT A MINUS."
1,It's a shame,Poor Kirk Douglas ! His son Michael f## up any movie he plays in... And Sharon Stone is said to have the highest I.Q. in Hollywood. That is NOT proven at all by being in this lousy movie.May I remind you that Hollywood does not exist only since the 90s but back to the 40s 50s and 60s there are hundreds of MASTERPIECES you haven't even heard of -watch them and get smart instead of losing your time with violent artless movies
2,Underrated,"Yes it is famous for the sex. But really, Paul Verhoeven has created an excellent modern Hitchcock yarn. Cheesy at times and overdone at others nevertheless Verhoeven and his cameraman Jan de Bont have done really great things. Steady cam work is brilliant and the dance club scene pulses with more energy and sexuality than any of the nudity crammed scenes in the film. Overlook the surface and you'll find a layered film made with great skill."
1,Very Poor Quality DVD Mastering,"I doubt that Artisan even bothered to remaster this DVD release -- it looks like it was either 1) taken directly from the Laserdisc master or (and most likely) 2) taken from a general release print (not the original print) of the movie. What a shame -- Artisan usually produces some great DVD packages, but not this time. Save your . . . money. . . and wait until a better DVD transfer hits the shelves..."
1,Learn how to make your own reeds.,"I played the bassoon in high school and purchased Jones reeds from a local music shop. 1 of 10 reeds I purchased were made properly. Not only did I spend a lot of money buying bad reeds, but it became frustrating playing the bassoon. I later found a professional bassoonist who provided me with handmade reeds and the majority of the issues w/ intonation I had were eliminated.These reeds are fine - I suppose- while you're learning the notes on a bassoon, but that's about it."
2,A Real Gem,"While Lari White's debut CD, Lead Me Not, did not make much of an impression on me(poor song selection, not her voice) she sure hit it out of the park with her follow-up, Wishes. The title song is, of course, stunning and Ms. White can sure push all ones buttons with her emotional delivery. This is one of those CDs you put in the player and just let it play as there are no clunkers to be found here. My favorite track is That's How You Know (When You're In Love), a glorious duet with Hal Ketchum, another singer we hear far too little from. If you only have one Lari White CD in your collection, it should be this one!!"
2,Grateful Dead's Rough Blues debut with a hint of psychadelia,"This is the first Grateful Dead album and was released on March 17, 1967. This was right when the Grateful Dead started to play psychadelic music which would later be showcased in their acid rock masterpiece Anthem of the Sun a year later. I think this is a pretty underrated album and it is a good showcase, especially with a live version of their first open-ended jam song which would sow the seeds for Dark Star, Viola Lee Blues.Since this is very different from their later albums, it is very special and I would say it isn't a very good intro but if you are getting into the Dead, I say welcome friend."
2,OXO Good Grips 28381 Corn Holders,"A very good product, much better than the usuall ones that break after a few uses."
1,very average,the disc starts off on a groove then it goes down hill.the vibe is lost and never picks back up again.The 5 year lay-off seems to have had a Impact on Miles.he was Hit&miss through out the 80's.The Funk of the 70's was Drowned out by the Synth&drum Machines of the 80's.
1,P. Kilmos is right,"All 10 of the songs come from Stone Cold Rhymin', and the CD doesn't even take the best 10 songs from the album. This CD is an absolute waste of money. Get Stone Cold Rhymin' instead."
1,too expensive for what you get.,"This product provides just 10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy, as it is simply too expensive. $30 should get at least 100 feet of track."
1,Not what I had in mind when i ordered it,"The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted. I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks, which is why it was ordered.This is my fault and not that of the spreader."
2,Lift-the-Flap Fun!,"""Lift-the-Flap Fun""""Who sits on the potty?"" Not the zebra! Not the sheep! Not the giraffe! Not even Sara - at least, not at first. With simply drawn illustrations in soft colors and flaps that lift to reveal the answers, your toddler is sure to adore this potty book. After reading over two dozen picture books on toilet training, we liked Sara's Potty because it was entertaining and educational. The wide, square flaps are more durable than the smaller slide-the-arrow variety featured in other similar activity books such as What Do You Do With A Potty? by Marianne Borgardt and Let's Go Potty by Moira Butterfield (but these books are also worth a look). Harriet Ziefert's story identifies the purpose of the potty (""pooping"" and ""peeing""), includes the often-omitted handwashing step, and shows the transition to ""big girl underwear."""
2,gets the job done,"before this i used another RCA cable - whenever my computer shifted even in the slightest, the stereo would completely fuzz out with an unbearable sound. this cable is completely sturdy. i can jostle all i like, and the sound stays constant. a good buy in my opinion."
2,Creepily good,"Since I tend to steer away from thrillers in general, I am not likely to say I've seen this plot before, which appears to be the major criticism provided by most of the posters. My spouse is a huge SB fan, and we are catching up on her movies that we somehow missed, or those we want to see again. Bullock is convincing and riveting as a damaged cop. The two young boys are absolutely chilling. Ben Chaplin is adequate. My major problem is with the police department's eagerness to wrap up the case, and the way Cassie's boss treats her when she is not satisfied with the way the case is initially closed. If she is so bad at her job that her boss won't even recognize her instincts, why does he even keep her on the force? I found his treatment to be demeaning and unrealistic. Other than that, this was a fine Bullock movie (certainly better than most of her ""serious"" efforts), and I would call it a worthy addition to the genre."
1,Great Irony,"My favorite thing about ""Murder by Numbers"" was the irony: The very thing the guilty boys were doing to mislead the police-red herring after red herring-was the very thing the producers/directors of the movie were doing to mislead the viewers into thinking they were watching a good movie."
1,Warmed-over TV thriller,"Slightly more interesting than your average made-for-TV thriller playing on cable stations Saturday afternoons, Murder By Numbers has a lot of interesting scenarios that end up clashing with each other in a the big, unappetizing stew that is this movie. Only recommended for huge Sandra Bullock fans."
1,Too many negative interpretations,"This dream dictionary,more than any other I've has more of a pesemistic outlook for the querent than most dictionaries. Perhaps the gloomy images are just a reflection of the days in which the book was written (1940's?) I won't knock the book completely because no other dream dictionary offers as many dream inter- pretations as this one. One does get their money's worth if that if quanity of dreams is the main qualifier. Myself, I do use the book on occasion and still enjoy it somewhat, but remember, many of today's common symbols like computers,televisions and other hi-tech symbols aren't listed.This is why I give the 10,000 dreams a score of 2 out of 5."
2,"Really tells the meanings of my dreams,fun for the family","If your'e looking for a book that tells the truth about your dreams,this isn't the book for you.But,I think it is''really'' fun to read the myths that they put in there and if one of your dreams will give you misfortune or constant luck in the future.So what i'm trying to say is ''This is a really good book and i would definately recommend this book to dream lovers all around the world!!''"
2,"Best can opener I,ve used","This can opener is easy on the hands, having a nice comfortable handhold and grip.It also bites into the can and cuts around the lip in a nice even action, no jerking.I,m not an engineer but this one looks much better made than others I have used."
2,Everyone needs one.,"For what it is, it's perfect! Every kitchen and emergency supply kit should have a manual can opener. The old kind, without all the ergonomics and padding, were uncomfortable to use; this one's a breeze. It arrived within 10 days of ordering, and is exactly as advertised."
2,"Dillin's ""The Kentucky Rifle"" is Definitive","Originaly published in the '20's, Capt. Dillin's history and illumination of the classic American longarm is the definitive work on the subject and serves as the primary reference for later works, such as those by Kindig, Shumway, Petersen, Buchele, Lindsay and others. Researched and written at a time when some of the last of the area gunmakers were still alive, his work is thoughtful, well-research and replete with examples, anecdotes and photos. No arms library is complete without this book. If you are at all interested in the Kentucky or Pennsylvania rifle, you will read every page."
1,Way too slow and cheesy,I just recently watched this film and found it very boring and extremely fake. The acting was basically non-existent and it seems that every bloke in this film is only out to get into the lead ladies pants. The only appealing feature of this film was the nude scenes.
1,The missing piece,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, something WAS missing in this book and I think I found it. Integrity. The frustration you feel on behalf of the lead Kaylie is every woman's nightmare of feeling trapped and helpless in a situation you have no control over. She is accosted in her own home by the zealous bounty hunter Sam McKade, mistaken to be her twin sister, molested when she claims she is NOT the one, and then dragged across the country against her will. The fact that Sam is supposed to be a professional only makes Kaylie's plight worse in that he doesn't do anything conclusive to find out if she's really who she says she is. Read the blurb and take the book as you will. Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading."
1,Flat characters. Boring Story. Mediocre writing.,I'm not very demanding of my books. I just want a fun story with fun characters. This book failed to deliver either. The characters stuck to every stereotype. The actions and reactions were unbelievable. My first and last Susan Andersen book.
2,Fun and sexy romance,"This fun read had everything needed to make it a good romance. The hero and heroine were both very likable characters with a lot of fun banter. I liked the premise of the story; having the twin sister mistakenly rounded up by a bounty hunter was a fun and entertaining plot. The story had the right mixture of action,enjoyable dialog and romance to make me a new fan of this author. This was only the second book I've read by her but will certainly read more. The side plot with the twin sister was also a fun and enjoyable addition."
1,fuentes,"i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it. i was not searching for an instructors edition, and no where in the text did it state the book as that..."
1,Overhyped without much substance,"Like many readers, I bought this book with high expectations based on the overwhelming claims it was so good. I hope to save others from my fate. Don't believe the ""reviews"" here that call this book a masterpiece or a classic. This book is terrible! Where are the honest reviews of this book?King's writing is dreadful, at times it seems English is his second language. His reuses the same or similar phrases. He uses many unnecessary modifiers. He adds extraneous words for filler. The dialogue rings false almost in its entirety. To make matters worse, the story is derivative and cliche. This concept of a child discovering that he or she is a wizard has been done to death already.I know it's a matter of taste, but nearly anything would be better than this."
1,Typical white-male misogyny,"A man I met (purely by accident) suggested I purchase this CD - so I thought I'd try it. I guess the joke was on me. I mean, this was more of the same-old, except taken to the extreeeeem! These ""men"" think they are God's gift, the whole time putting down anything without a 10"" ""love prong"" Who do they think they're fooling? These are scared little boys - with large guitars (and that's about it). ""Working"" on a Sex-Farm? I'm sorry but I (nor any woman I know) wants to be ""plowed like a bean-field"" or ""stuck with [his] pitch-fork""!!! I even heard (the usually acceptable) Rob Riener made a movie about these perverts! Is the whole male world going crazy?"
1,"Sequins, swearing and silliness","Barney meets the Godfather. Lots of violence and cussing but nothing interesting. It's a kids' show with the Irish Mafia (huh?) thrown in. But don't take your kids -- it's very violent.Obviously, I don't recommend it!"
1,Horrid Film,"This is still to this day one of the most awful films i ever saw. I took a girl on a date for this movie and wow, what a mistake. The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more."
1,EEWWW that smell!,"The worst movie ever? This movie is marketed as being a ""Barney"" bashing movie, for all those parents fed up with having to endure endless hours of mindless childrens videos. But instead of biting sarcasm and rampant deviltry, the viewer is subjected to endless full-blown musical numbers written for children. Watching this movie was like watching 2 hours of Barney videos. Instead of treating children's icons like pinatas, this movie is an homage to them. The script was written for children. It completely lacks adult humor, and any humor at any level period. The lone exception is one scene by robin Williams, where he slams into a brick wall during a spoof of Singing in the Rain. I was stunned that there were no other laughs in a movie with such a great comedian.If you haven't had enough of Barney then this movie is for you."
2,One of my favorite movies of last year.,"Every single person I know loved this movie. From the songs (I will find the soundtrack some day) to the great character acting, this movie is one of the best I saw all last year. No it's not a movie for kids, I but I firmly believe that if something is rated R kids shouldn't see it anyway. But to all the adults out there...this movie is wonderful."
2,"""uh...uh...it's a rocket!""","""Death to Smoochy"" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Robin Williams and Edward Norton were GREAT. The whole concept? No one puts Rainbow Randolph out of work! DIE SMOOCHY DIE!! I recommend this film to everyone (even if you're not fond of dark comedies).Totally original and brilliantly directed by Danny DeVito, ""Death to Smoochy"" has become one of my favorites!"
1,A Total Piece of You-Know-What,"This is definitely one of the WORST pieces of rubbish I have ever seen. Robin Williams and Edward Norton are EXCELLENT actors, so why they decided to participate in creating something so dull, plotless, stupid, and inane is beyond me.I desperately tried to figure out the plot to this, but I realized I couldn't because a plot simply does NOT exist. This movie is trying to come across as a quirky, off-the-wall comedy, but it's one big emotionless yawn. No laughs, no tears, no interest, no smiles, no frowns. I sat with a blank expression on my face the ENTIRE time.Take my advice - do NOT, by any means, buy this movie. It is honestly one of the worst pieces of film ever created."
1,It's junk,The workmanship and quality is second rate. The handle is the only nice thing about the zester. The steel is literally junk.
1,Dull Channnel Knife,I purchased the OXO lemon zester specifically for the purpose of making long lemon garnishes for martinis and other beverages. It worked tolerably well the very first time but after that the channel knife was too dull to work at all. Was very disappointed.OXO Good Grips Lemon Zester. Am looking for a proper channel knife and would welcome suggestions.
1,"Edited, not at ALL what I wanted","This video was EDITED, and the seller should've listed it as such, and I wouldn't have purchsed it. I contacted the seller, and received no response. They should tell you that it is NOT the full version. My favorite scene was NOT on this video, so I was very disappointed."
1,Alice Lackluster,Don't know to whom this would appeal.Fine actors wasted on this attempt to breathe new life into a wonderful Victorian Era story. Nothing like the Wizard of Oz for fantasy and visual excitement. Young viewers I showed this to were immediately bored with its pseudo intellectualisms even an adult would tire of.
1,THE METAL RIPPED?,"Imagine my suprise when after less than a year of use, the metal grid broke, bending outward while pressing a clove of garlic. Very dissapointing. And while my hands never slipped of the ""non-slip grip"" the grips themselfs often (every use) slipped down on the metal handles. I think I'll try another brand this time!"
1,I wouldn't buy it again...,"I bought this garlic press about 5 years ago. It has done a good job for the past 5 years, but a month ago it broke on me. I didn't do anything extraordinary. I was just using the press like normal and the hinge broke. Also, the black rubber handles slide back and forth allowing water to get into the handles"
1,"Mine broke, too!","Great features (the comfortable grips and self-cleaning) but it is not durable at all. Hinge broke while crushing a small clove of garlic and the press was less than 3 months old! Certainly not overused nor abused by any means. Even hand-washed despite the fact they say it's dishwasher safe.The press ""looks"" like good quality stainless steel but I've never seen stainless ""snap"" like this one did. I know of two other family members whose OXO presses broke at the hinge, too.So, I will not be wasting my money on this brand. I'll go with a true stainless steel press until this manufacturer can improve on this one."
1,"OXOs stuff is generally quite good, but this is an exception","Overall, I've been very impressed with OXO tools. However, I have to say that this garlic press is a notable exception. It's just not built to withstand any kind of heavy use. If you put any medium or large-sized clove of garlic in it, you will break the press, it's only a matter of time. I've gone through 2 of them this way, and it's a shame, because generally OXO tools hold up much better than this."
1,Ours snapped,"Ours snapped, under normal use -- not at the hinge, but on the shaft connecting the handle to the sieve half of the press. You wouldn't think a thick stainless steel shaft could snap under hand pressure. And probably it couldn't. But this press is not made of stainless steel. Once it snapped, we could see that it was made of some kind of semi-porous composite material with a chrome finish that makes it look like solid metal."
1,Broke in less than 3 months,Trust the other reviews. Mine broke just like the rest.Pros (before it broke) -- +4 stars.* Comfortable* Worked well (including the rubber bristle for cleaning the press)Cons -- -3 stars.* It broke in less than 3 months. Head area snapped off.Overall: 1 star...
1,Went back to OXO twice -- made from weak metal,"Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).I will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss. But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done."
1,Not for those who are serious about garlic,"If you put a large clove in this one, you will be hard pressed (ha, ha) to squeeze it through unless you have large, strong hands. Mine ended up in the trash after one of the handles snapped clean off."
2,"Works great, but breaks","I've been very happy with my OXO Garlic Press over the 5 or so years I've used it. The problem is that over time, the metal hinge wears out and eventually breaks, leaving the press useless. I've had this happen with two different OXO garlic presses, so I know it wasn't just a bad batch. I did use it fairly often, so maybe that just comes with the territory. For the third try, I'm going to try the Zyliss Susi press instead."
1,Bad recipes,"This is a lovely, cheerfully written cookbook, and only one recipe I have prepared from it has been any good. The rest are boring and flavorless. I love casseroles, but I've finally given up on this book.Update 11/12/2007: OK, so I didn't give up. I just made the San Antonio Chili Casserole. Sounded good: chili with a cornbread topping. Did he leave out ingredients for the cornbread or what? Butter and eggs and nothing else? Added some buttermilk, and although the chili wasn't terrible -- standard beans (lots of beans) and ground beef -- the recipe had to be tweaked too much to call it a success. Get some Junior League or community church cookbook if you want these recipes -- anything!Update 01/26/2009: OK, because I am a masochist (and apparently a sadist to my family), I tried one more recipe (Mamie's Ham and Black-Eyed Pea Supper), and I now plan to permanently delete anything by Mr. Villas from my recipe file. You have been warned."
2,Wonderful Performances of Bluegrass Standards,"This CD, just like Volume 1, has it all - astonishing and soulful picking, extraordinary harmony singing, and a good choice of songs. There's something wonderful to be found in just about every cut. Some of my favorites: J.D. Crowe's banjo solo in ""Molly and Tenbrooks"", the harmonies and vocal counterpoint in ""So Happy I'll Be"", and Jerry Douglas's licks in ""Big Spike Hammer"". Somebody else could pick three others, though, and I probably wouldn't disagree with him. Bluegrass doesn't get any better than this."
2,I'm in LOVE,A great mix of styles and great vocals.I recently discovered this CD and was not dissapointed.A must get!
1,Spend a little more to get a lot better,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6"" utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy, it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
1,DRAB,I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento. It certainly didn't grab my attention. She provides a lot of detail..perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience. I would suggest another book on the Risorgimento over Riall's account such as Derek Beales.
1,not what I expected,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law to help her find God's purpose in her life as she goes through this difficult time. What this book does is teach New Age theology and is not Biblical, and the author names her ""god"" Universe. I returned the book."
2,Japanese anime(moving manga) is good translation.,"Lucki sta(Lucky Star) is a high school ladies stories.There are no important things in the stories.But it is well presented Japanese high school days.People call a person without Mr. and Ms.Instead of Mr. or Ms., chan or san are used after the name.It is explained in the notes in the package.In japanese, speaking is a little slow.But English version is a little fast.That is the main difference in Japanese version and English version.Best Regards."
1,"Useless, Horrible, and Filled with Typos!","This book was filled with an unbelievable number of mistakes. On every test, it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many, many, many words. Often (a few times a page) it forgets to leave spaces between words. There are no tables to convert your sample tests into SAT scores. And to top it off, the answer guide is often wrong. This was the worst $10 that I have ever spent. Save yourself money, don't buy this horrible book!"
1,Cute but not quality,The material this is made of just does not hold up when thrown in a purse all the time. The material frays all over the place and looked tacky within a month or two. I did not contact the manufacturer (I guess I should have) and just threw it in a bag for Goodwill. I would not recommend this for others!
1,problems with the display,"After about a week, parts of the numbers on the display were no longer visible. I'll try to get it replaced. Let's see what happens next."
2,long knife,"this story shows how the efforts of ""george rogers clark"" contributed to the growth of this country. we are used to hearing about the exploits of the revolutionary war but not often do we get a chance to know what was going on in the northwest territory. this is one of the best books i have ever read that covers how important a part was played by what was happening there. i recommend this book as an excellent read and most informative."
1,Couldn't keep me interested . . .,"I have read several historical books in the past year. My dissappointment in this book stems from the fact that it spent too much time in the early going describing General Rogers' physique and general superhero status. I quickly lost interest in the subject. Still, I am interested enough in the subject and the historical time period that I may seek out other relevant books. My first reading experience with a James Alexander Thom book was, unfortunately, not a good one."
2,Exactly as advertised!,"A delightful series of tales From the Land of Barely There, by Stephen Cosgrove...He tellls storys for little ones that teach them important life-lessons in a great way that kids can really relate to.."
1,Wanna buy mine??,"I bought this DVD after trying Turbo Jam off of Beach Body (cause I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Turbo Jam!!) thinking this might be just as good....boy, was I wrong!! I have taken a couple of yoga classes and this video was SUPER cheesy - nothing like real yoga!! I really wish that I would have been able to sample a little video clip of it on the internet before purchasing. I think it was a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not an iota of authenticity,"If you are looking for a Yoga, Ballet and yes, even booty-licious workout, I recommend you buy three different workouts instead of YBB. Yogis are literally rolling over in their graves at these ladies. This is so typical nowadays, to find irreverence in everything. I would suggest renting this before buying. I rented and am so glad I did. My eyes were rolling the whole time and many of the cardio ""booty"" workouts are just awful--literally ridiculous. The changes they make to moves and the speed they start at in the intro video might actually injure someone less limber. There are way better videos out there, for less money too--these ladies just have better marketing behind them."
2,Great memories,I was lucky enough to see this great play on broadway many years ago and owned the LP. Needed to upgrade my music collection to more modern times (AKA CD) The story is still so true in today's society so the music was still very enjoyable. We lost a great composer and singer with the passing of Anthony Newley.
2,This is a difficult book but a good book.,I learned that wolves communicate and have territories and there are no-wolf zones. I never knew that people could talk to wolves.
1,Interesting but buggy,"And I mean ""buggy"" as in this piece of software will suddenly crash and leave you with an UNOPENABLE file, not useable at all -- goodbye to who knows how many hours of work?It's interesting software and it's great with a Wacom tablet, but Corel just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together and I'm certainly not in a hurry to spend MORE money on a new version hoping they got it right.I mean, expecting to be able to save and re-open a file is not asking for the moon."
1,Painter IX Problems,We have used earlier versions of Painter and liked it. But the newly released version of Painter IX has serious Windows XP issues. Hope to be lucky or be prepared for endless hours trying to get it to run on your Windows XP machine.
2,"Used For Drywall, Could Fit Better","I bought these for a the drywall we've been repairing due to two different leaks in our home. They worked okay for the most part. I also purchased the sander to hook up to the vacuum and I was totally happy with the setup. The vacuum did off and on come off so all the debris was going straight into the vacuum. I checked to make sure it was not user error. It was not, it just could have a little bit tighter fit on the rubber gasket that fits on the intake of the vacuum.I probably would purchase again because of the price, and how quickly it arrived. I didn't notice any dust spewing into the air, which is important with a little one in the home. As with any home repair there will be some dust as seen on the furniture."
2,Inspired,"Clever, blasphemous, corrosively funny and sometimes poignant. It's the real thing. Let's face it: putting this in front of a pop music audience was like feeding oysters and icy vodka to a baby. No wonder it failed commercially. But it bears repeated listening, in my experience. Knowing Goethe's Faust (Part I) helps. The orchestration is creative, the melodies occasionally lovely. I only wish that it had been fully developed instead of staying in its unfinished form, because it would have ranked among the best of American musical theater. The remaining tracks are fragments of a brilliant work."
1,disappointment,"I am a big Randy Neuman fan, but did not like this CD. The one song I bought it for was sung by someone else, not Randy, and 99% of the songs on it were biblical, like for a church service, and others were from the stage."
2,This book will keep you wondering until the end,"I thought I could figure out the plot several times, but Victoria Holt spins away from the mundane. One never knows what's going to happen in the end."
2,Great Christmas Eve Movie,"Watched this with our kids and what a great Christmas Eve movie. We can remember when this movie came out and might have seen it in the theaters. Got many chuckles out of the kids asking ""what is that"" refrencing the walkman or original Pepsi bottles. Great movie and great time with the family."
2,WHAT NOT TO DO WHEN GOING ON VACATION !!!!,MOVIE #1: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND/ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION ....MOVIE #2: CHILDREN LEFT BEHIND .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS GOING ON VACATION....MOVIE #3: CHILDREN LEFT ALONE .... CARELESS SUPERVISION BY PARENTS WORKING WITHOUT A NANNY IN HOMEE.....MOVIE #4: not yet watched by me....
1,Bummer!,"Don't buy this thinking you are getting a Director's Cut. You get the movie with rambling talking over the whole movie. Normally when you buy something like this, it includes one disc with the actual movie and another disc with the director's cut as well as out takes, etc. If you want the movie - don't buy this! SUCH A BUMMER!"
2,fitful,"I think most of this movie is mediocre at best. It's contrived, formulaic, poorly written and acted. But, the half-hour of slapstick when the burglars are trying to break into the home is SO hilarious, it's worth sitting through the other parts. It's really a hilarious half hour. So, that's a mixed review!"
2,home alone the christmas classic,"i love this film macaulay culkin is a great actor and does great facial expressions...the plot as everyone must know by now is that an 8 year boy named kevin gets left behind at home as the family are goin' on holiday...and the burgulars that come too pay kevin a christmas visit have already been run to check the joint out as policeman..so kevin fills the house with traps yadda yadda yadda you get what i'm on about..get the film and forget about what ""JD"" OR ""JB"" they sucked too much dick and need to get a sense of humour so what if it doesn't all add up it's still a fantastic film so stop being an...polictal correctness weed will ya?"
2,Fun movie,"I love to watch this movie around Christmas. While not technically a ""Christmas Movie"" it does take place during the holiday season. The robbers are a little too over the top for my adult taste but after all the movie is targeted to kids so I can over look that."
2,We need to get this man more attention!! He is great.,"Let me just say record companies who passed him up are making a mistake. This is quality real life good music. As is all of Rhett's music. ""That Girl"" is a song all of us guys seem to relate to and it makes us smile. Rhett is so right in ""Trouble With a Woman"". This is a perfect CD to listen to with your dad while out fishing or driving around the countryside with your high school buddies. And there are the songs that you will want your girl by your side as well. ""Livin' Right"" is my favorite song of all time! It is my story. It's beautiful. Everyone get this because you'll enjoy it and we owe it to the great Rhett."
2,A great read!,"This piece of fiction is worth your time. It is written by one of the world's foremost authorities on military snipers and is the only technically accurate work of fiction about snipers I have ever come across. It is well written, and hard to put down. The characters are believable and likeable. It is a good companion piece to the author's non-fiction ""One Shot Brotherhood"""
2,History,"This book came alive. I wanted to be there, I felt Tom's thoughts, I knew why Cassy was internally angry, and I wanted to help. I wonder if this book changed the conscience of society in the way it shifted my thinking. Harriet Beecher Stowe would be amazed with the improvements America has made. There is still a tremendous amount of hatred, racism and prejudice occurring today. Tom's morality gave strength to those around him. Close to one hundred years later Dr. King's anti-violent moral deliverance gave strength to those around him! The novel is pivotal for self reflection. If you're white and you lived in the 1700's; what would be your stance on slavery? What is your stance on racial hatred and prejudice today? Do not let history repeat itself."
2,a classic,"This classic moved me to tears in parts. Although it is wordy compared with modern writing, it is a ""must"" for all who care for those still being exploited today. If you have nerver read it before-do so asap!"
2,An important learning experience on the system of slavery.,"This novel portrays the unjust and cruel accounts of slavery through the lives of some very unique characters. The reader goes through some vauable life experiences with each one of the characters to see how slavery affects them personally. By doing this,Stowe, makes the reader aware of the effects that slavery can have ona human race dealing with the themes of family seperation,motherhood, religion and social cruelty. This easy-read novel provides a valuable learning experience for the reader on the instituion of slavery. I would recommend it to students from ninth grade up to adults who are willing to become educated in a vivid way on this topic."
2,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"I purchased this book for my son. It was required reading for his 11th grade Honors English class. He needed this book ASAP because as usual, he waits until the very last minute to tell me he has something due at school. I went to Amazon.com and found this book. The price was well within what I wanted to pay for the book. The time between ordering and receiving the book was only a couple of days. I was very pleased with both the item purchased and the time it took to receive the item. The book was in great condition also. I would buy from this seller again and again. Thanks! Tina B. Memphis, TN"
2,What a Suprise!,"I had heard of Uncle Tom's Cabin all my life and finally decided to read it. What a wonderful suprise! It is well written, has well-developed characters, a fast-moving plotline and is very inspirational. I was amazed at how it is openly Christian. I have heard people be called ""Uncle Toms"" in a derogatory way. After reading this book I'd say ""wow, what a complement ... Uncle Tom is an awesome example!"
1,Not Faithfully Reproduced,"This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it. In my edition at Loc 2416 appears ""I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,"". It then continues with something completely out of context and including the character Ophelia St. Clare. The correct continuation appears at Loc 2447, so that the rendering should have been, ""I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,just now. I have not looked in the papers."" Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book.This kind of error is shameful. Amazon should refund the money paid for the book to every Kindle purchaser of it."
2,A Powerful and Moving Book,"It is easy to see why this book became the clarion call for abolitionism prior to the Civil War. The narrative is riviting and powerfully wrought with characters so vividly rendered I felt I could almost reach out and touch them. I first became acquainted with excerpts of this book in high school but never read it in its entirety. Now that I have finally completed it 46 years lager, it ranks as one of the most compelling novels I have read."
1,Long and stupid.,I didn't really enjoy reading this book. The language was too archaic for me to read (and understand) it. Don't read this book.
2,book,This book has to be read to understand the impact it had on America. Words alone cannot describe the emotions one feels when reading it
2,something to think about,"Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the 1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave, Tom. Uncle Toms Cabin shows you the hardships slaves went through to not get a beating from their master, though many endured that anyway. It opened my eyes to the reality of slavery, and the severity of it all. The book not only talks about slavery, but it also addresses the issue of religion. Although I did not get a chance to read Uncle Toms Cabin carefully, I enjoyed what I could of it and would definitely re-read it so I could get a better understanding.i would also definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading about the slavery issues of the 1800s."
2,one of my all-time fav CDs,"I instantly fell in love with Le Tigre, it was one of those magical experiences at the listening station where I knew this cd would affect me so much as to leave a deep impact crater a mile wide!I have been listening to it for weeks...just listen to it...NOW!"
1,"2 girls, 3 girls, or no girls...does it matter?","If going to see a concert doesn't neccicarily expect the creation of live music, then I guess this band is ok.But I went to see Le Tigre play-- and while they did get everybody to dance, I was shocked to see that all they did for half their songs was press play and then dance metaphorically-sloppy corriographed dance moves. The Le Tigre experience means shouting a ""mediocre"" theme repeatedly and jumping from side to side tossing your head... I just think other bands have achieved this and even more. I am concearned because of how old most of the audience was... in their late teens and early 20s. Maybe it's the X and coke and heroine coming back in place of LSD... kids are not wandering into other levels of the room, they are ripping up the sheets and jumping on the bed of rock and roll."
1,Just ok,I used it for the first time last night. Worked well as far as the pounding part but I put it in the dishwasher and it came out dull with lots of gray stuff rubbing off. That is why I replaced my old one that had belonged to my mother. If you can't put a meat pounder in the dw what good is it.
2,"""Good Grips"" Tenderizer","The OXO tenderizer does it's job remarkably well, with little to no sustained damage over multiple uses. However, it's very difficult to clean and doesn't fit in my dishwasher easily.But, if you don't mind some additional time for cleaning, this is a perfect kitchen appliance!"
1,A Letdown,the movie promised much and delivered nothing!! Two stars for the actors who did a good job with a lousy scenario and plot.
1,The Signal,"The actors were fantastic but the film itself contained too much blood, gore and senseless killing. Purchase only if you love blood and killing in films."
1,Has no meaning but killing and beating each others,This movie has no meaning or story to tell except beating and killing each other for no reason from start to end.
2,Great to see you again Toni!,"The beautiful Toni Braxton has made an excellent comeback with her single ""He Wasn't Man Enough For Me."" It is a song filled with energy, emotion and exemplary vocals by this fine diva from Severn, Maryland. The musical beats in this song are hypnotic. When listening to this single one has no choice but to get up to dance and party. This songs puts a person in such a great mood.This song possesses a distinct quality from her other songs in that it is groovy and funky R&B tune. Toni Braxton's notable vocals on this single has definitely put her over the edge.""Great single Toni! It's so glad to have you back. I really hope this will help alleviate the hardship that you have gone through. Life has its ups and down. I have no doubts that she you will see a promising future. I pray for great talented artists like you. Keep up the great work Toni!""""He Wasn't Man Enough"" receives a Kenny rating of A+."
2,He wasn't man enough,"well tony i thing that this song is very good actually it is great. I like this song because i have just got out of a relationship and the girl is worred about me and she should be worring about he. He's a cheater ,lier. but any way great song, can't want for it to come out iam going to buy it thanks keely"
2,Relaxing,This is a relaxing CD that i enjoy listening to when i get home from work or have had a stressing day in general. Well worth listening to
1,Country Cheese,"Before we get into this too far, I have to say: I knew all about the Grateful Dead from friends but I had never bought an LP (or ripped a bootleg) so from say - 1972 - to today (2009) I had none of their stuff. I was more into the Allman Brothers and the Doobie Brothers (pre and post Michael McDonald that is). That was where my head was at. SO - I finally got my first GD album - Europe 72,just a couple of weeks ago, on a recommendation - and to me, it is just this side of mediocre. What is the big deal? They sound like any number of C&W bands that roll into my town for the annual C&W Festival. I'm serious, this album is boring. It is the kind of stuff that we used to play in our sheds to warm up. Maybe Europe in 1972 wan't ready for the GD, but for me it is a snoozeathon. Sorry, but it bites the big one."
2,Great watch,"It's more like a computer though, it's super smart. A very helpful tool to track heart rate, speed, distance, time, etc. The red is nice too."
2,A Practical Handbook for Modern Living,"David K Reynolds is our foremost author on the subject of ""Constructive Living"", part philosophy, part Shinto-Buddhism, part psychotherapy, but 100% practical and useful in our normal daily life. David's style always amazes me and this book is no exception: In a short, affordable volume of less than 100 pages, in an afternoon's reading and for less than the cost of lunch, he asks those questions which strike right at the very heart of our troubles and changes our lives forever. This is not a book about buddhism, it's not about digging in your psychological closets, it's just plain sense insight into how we can live more constructively."
2,Simply Nice!,"...Such a fine piece of music. Mel, George and the producers are simply the best right here and now. I have played Bass since early 1950. This fellow . . . Brian Torff on the Bass, simply makes me happy. That's the way I might have played if I simply had the tallent that Torff has. You need a gift from God in order to play like Torff does.Thanks for still being alive!"
2,Worth it,"I think Mary-Kate and Ashley are great on this DVD. I really enjoy this new show of theirs and this particular DVD really makes them seem older and it's funny. Plus there are cute boys. Another fabulous point, they dress soooo well and I just really wish I was one of them."
2,message from a pro,"Locksmiths have launch a private war against publications like this in an effort to protect their ""secrets"". This book is the most popular lock picking books in the world and is going to sell, regardless of the bad press from Locksmiths. The only lock picking secrets you can learn from locksmiths is; there is more money in drilling out locks than picking them."
2,Excellent Blackjack book,"The best beginners blackjack book around. I found it not only presented a very workable system, but it explained it clearly and easily. The first chapters do an excellent job of explaining the ""history"" of blackjack, and the next chapters gradually add to the complexity of the count. My only complaint is that the ""full"" system with all the indices is not explained better. Otherwise, does an excellent job of explaining a very good system for counting cards that a beginner can handle and that many experts use."
2,Highly recommended!,"This is a very easy system to learn, still it's among the most powerful and profitable systems ever created. Even if you want to go professional it should be one of your first choices. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to beat the dealer, aren't a math genius and wants to have some fun."
2,I made money with this book!,"I actually made money in Las Vegas after reading this book! Did I get rich..NO, but making a few hundred dollars made me feel like a million bucks! Card counting is easy especially if you go to the ""beginners"" tables they have at some casinos where the dealers don't make small talk to try and distract you while you are playing. You can beat the house sometimes and it is just plain fun to learn a system and use it effectively. The real key is to know when to quite and don't spend more than 45 minutes at a table or you start to get fatigued from the concentration required to do this."
1,Out Dated and Stale,"While the KO system gives players a slight advantage, this book neglects the fact that you will only win with counting if you play A LOT. With how much you have to play to make a profit, why stick with an old and oversimplified system? For only a few more hours of work you can learn a level two system and make way more money. The KO system is the easy way out and pays accordingly. Most of this information can be found online anyways. If you are serious about making money counting, leave this count behind and pick up a book with a level two system."
2,A Solid Book - though a touch dated.,"This book gave a solid grounding in what is available and a broad idea of how to use each of the options, such as IPSec with Openswan; PPTP with PopTop, using SSH+PPP, and other more proprietary VPN methods.Some of the info is a bit dated; For example, many Linux kernels these days come standard with support for IPSec and PPTP as modules. I definitely recommend after reading this book and deciding on a VPN strategy, that you find quality web sites with more up-to-date information about how to configure your selected VPN technology on your selected Linux distribution. I chose Debian/GNU Linux myself. With this book and some updated information added to that foundation, I feel like I have a good start."
2,Lenox Christmas Table Cloth,"Perfect, just what I wanted. Will be great on table next Christmas. I have shower curtain and bath accessories also in this design."
1,Fits buts needs modification,Not a drop-in replacement. Needed to cut a piece of plastic flange to get it to fit. Overall it works and matches the original.
1,Awesome Gadget,"This thing scoops out rock hard ice cream so easily. I've gone through many ice cream scoopers and I stuggled with all of them. Yes, it is more like a slab of ice cream than a scoop, but if it's going in a bowl and not a cone, then so what. No more letting the ice cream sit out for 10 minutes.*UPDATE*I should have updated this a while ago, as I threw this thing out a long time ago. It's coated in some non-stick material that I noticed flakes of in my ice cream. Since it's only used for ice cream, I can't imagine what caused it to flake off. It never goes in the dishwasher, either. I still love the design, but I'm not interested in eating teflon, or whatever they use to coat this. One star, not five!"
1,fun at times but ....well stupid,"Sure this album presents a reason for you to bob your head. It allows you to have fun. but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in. While many view the uk subs as punk pioneers i feel they are in all essense just another band. The album drones on for what seems like hours, and is so rendundant that i find it hard to distinguish one song from the next. There are maybe a few fun spots such as ""cid"", or ""new york state police but other than that the hub bub is wrong."
2,Val Kilmer Pulls A Rabbit Out Of The Hat,"In the first three minutes of this film, Val Kilmer tells you not to judge him until you have viewed his life (this film). This film begins rather depressingly with several druggie losers and multiple large body tattoos and the worst narcotics -- and our druggie loser Val Kilmer trapped in a fire. A film that begins this low, this fatal, how could it get better? How can we root for such a pathetic loser? Hang in there! You will be surprised at the ending. Really surprised. Next to ""Tombstone"", one of Val's best. Did I mention, you will be surprised at the ending?"
2,Nothing is as it seems,"Val Kilmer's character warns the viewer right at the beginning that nothing is what it appears to be. Is Kilmer Danny, a punk-rock meth tweaker turned police snitch? Or is he a talented jazz musician named Todd Van Allen? The beautifully shot film noir presents many pieces to the puzzle, all of which fit together perfectly for a shocker of an ending. There really aren't words to decribe the movie or the storyline--it's just something you have to let unfold for itself.Vincent D'Onofrio is stellar as the villianous messed-up desert drug king in the movie.It's strange that this movie is cross-marketed with Spun so frequently. Yes, both are set in the world of methamphetamine, but Spun is an almost comedic train wreck of a drug trip, while The Salton Sea is a larger than life fable that happens to be set in the world of the Southern California meth industry."
2,Hornblower wins again!,"This book continues the adventures of Horatio in to the Tropics. He has this great humility that comes across as hilariously funny, especially during times of crisis.The rlationship with his wife is detailed more in these stories which shows his more warm and human side.I feel like I would like him if I met him."
2,Definitly a Light Read,"This is a nice little book. Princess Alesandra goes to England to escape an almost insane general who wants to marry her. She goes to England to find her own husband so General Ivan would not be able to force her to marry him. In a roundabout fashion she marries Colin. Seperately these are two wonderful people and I liked how they worried about each other, but I hated Colin's high- handed methods. He was always ordering Alesandra what to do and what not to do. What I really hated though was that Alesandra always gave in. I like JUlie Garwood, but this is definitly not her best work. I like independent women who aren't submissive. Okay if you are really bored and not in the mood to yell at the characters stupidity."
1,not worth the time of a long time fan,"This story greatly disappointed me. The character of Princess Alesander has great similarity with Christina from the book titled ""Lion's Lady"". Both make the hero confuse and make you laugh to read their act in trying to understanding the lady. It's fun for the first time fan. But not worth the time of a long time fan like me"
2,Classic.,"From the moment track one begins until the final fade out, you won't regret this purchase. Finally, an underground rapper with enough action in his words to break out of the backpack. There's some great production here by El-P, Ant, and RJD2, but the rapping is so much better. If you find that underground rap it too cerebral and wishy-washy sometimes, you owe it to yourself to buy this."
2,A brilliant book for the beginng investor or corporate executive,"Mr. Buffet does a remarkable job of simplifying the complexities of investing. His homespun stories and self-deprecating humor make the subject matter entertaining, easy to understand and very useful.It is remarkable for a man of his stature in the investment world to openly discuss his many mistakes and bad investment decisions and yet, we should all be so lucky as to have the fortitude and the wisdom to invest with the same degree of success that he has experienced - even with much smaller sums of money.I highly recommend this book to everyone that owns common stock."
1,Good General Knowledge But Needs More Information,"I just read this guidebook for the second time. It provides a good overview of living in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Ecuador. However, I think anyone seriously considering living in Costa Rica or Mexico would profit more by reading one of the other travel guidebooks about residing in these countries. The other guides deal specifically with these countries and provide much more complete information."
2,Tonny Harnnel debut,This is the Tonny's debut on TNT and shows exacltly why he stayed therte for over 20 years. Seven Seas is still as good today as it was then ans all tne other songs are great too. Must have for fans.
1,boring and poorly written,"I don't know how anyone could have enjoyed this book. It's horrible! There's no plot in Persian Nights whatsoever and I practically fell asleep every time I tried to read it. After reading and enjoying Le Divorce I found this book by Diane Johnson to be far worse. I recommend this book be avoided by anyone who does not want to sit through a slow, dull, and overall bad read. I honestly don't know how it got any good reveiws at all. Try one of her other novels maybe, but steer clear of this one!"
1,Ugly Americanism!,The title of my review states my opinion ofthe book . I will not waste my time any further
2,"Classic Diane Johnson, very funny","Like Le Divorce, Diane Johnson once again serves us a teaspoon of female angst in a foreign locale. I always find her books to be very funny, written in her unique sardonic tone. The only complaint that I have is that like Le Divorce, the book has a slow start and takes a while to get into. But the endings are always satisfying and action-packed. What I like most about her books is that Johnson always makes the heroine very human, but albeit likable. Chloe is obviously self-centered, but it becomes apparent how well this serves her by the end of the book. Lots of plot twists make this perfect beach reading. I reccommend it highly."
1,Campy in the extreme!,"This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of ""The Klansman."" Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville, California and promptly proposed to an 18 year Denny's waitress. His costar, Lee Marvin, was also drinking a bottle a day. Neither was sober for a single syllable of this terrible movie and their struggles to appear sober make for some hilarious moments.Burton, as usual, dreadfully overacts and his attempts at a Southern accent are pitiful, to say the least. Marvin's acting is much better, but when he has to speak inane lines from a miserable script, he can't fare much better.This is a great movie to watch with a couple of beers. If you appreciate a terrible script, crude sets and two major stars who were drunk out of their minds while filming, you'll love this one."
2,Best Jung book for the layperson,"This book was written with the layman in mind, the book examines the average person's need to find his soul. All of the ideas in this book are still as valid as they were when the book was first written. But the need for this book is more than ever."
1,Not happy,"When I got my nozzles, they where not what is shown in the pictures, you show here! And I payed $13. and change too return them! I would like my money back, but mostly would like too get 10 of the nozzle shown!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,High quality ricer,"This was a gift for my sister-in-law. She was thrilled with it! It has a nice long handle, which was what she was looking for, and it is a nice size and has a nice feel, as do many Good Grips products."
2,Perfect mashed potatoes,"This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow, what squeezes out is also ""mashed"" so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes, but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean."
2,Mashing Made Easy,Mashed potatoes is a pinch with this product! The press is well constructed with durable materials and dyes that easily pop out for cleaning.Pros:-heavy-quick-relatively inexpensive but good quality-easy to cleanCons (but manageable!):-heavy (another style may be better for people with joint issues)-potatoes sometimes squeeze through the top-does require scraping bottom to remove potato (apparently other styles come with a feature that swipes the bottom clean for you)
2,best cd purchase i've made(3 years ago)still my favorite,"I own three of elliot smith's cds. either/or, elliot smith, and figure eight. what is so great about my collection is that each cd has a certain mood to it. they're all different but definetly smith. the great thing about either/or is how it is just his voice and the acoustics. when you put your headphones on and just listen you can hear every little detail like when he takes a breath to start a new stanza. like you're right there. the music is personal. my favorite song is number 4 ""between the bars"". THEY ARE ALL GREAT! IF YOU LIKE LOW-KEY ACOUSTIC THIS IS FOR YOU. HOPE YOU APPRECIATE AND ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DO! ROCK ON!"
1,Self Promoting,"I bought this book hoping for stories of ghostly legends from New England. What I got was some guy who considers himself a ghost hunter that has a friend that supposedly can connect with the ghosts that haunt the places they visit.Reading this book was like watching a TV special, you know the kind, where the magician picks someone out from the audience and keeps on saying ""now I do not know you, nor have I ever met you"".I really wished I did not buy this book."
2,Bmod book,Book in perfect condition. Thanks for getting it to me relatively quickly and at a good price!
1,This product is a joke,"I bought RS ARP-900E Portable Air Conditioner - 9000 BTU from Fry's yesterday. It is over $400. Today I am going to return it. Of course, it only takes a few minutes to set up and very easy for anyone to operate it. We set it up and tried for a few hours, and then we feel extremely disappointed. If you live in the South and your room's temperature reaches 90 F and you wish to use a portable air conditioner to cool the room down, good luck. This product can only cool a little spot where it is pointing. The vent hose gets very hot and you can feel the heat like a little stove behind the air conditioner. So it cools down the air in one spot and heats up the air in another spot of the room. I read a customer's review before who believed to give it 10 years for the technology to develop. Now, I understand why he/she said that. I'll say to give it over 15 years for engineers to work on it before it is put on markets."
1,No changes here,"I do like crossing the t's on the top, and writing my first initial as the star A, but other than that, I generally find it a rather ugly script. Perhaps that's why it's not working for me, but I've not noticed any changes in myself or my life despite months of writing the t's and A's as she says."
1,kind of boring,"You know ,I have to apologetically say I didn't really like this too much. I love bluegrass and play banjo but it just wasn't my style. I expected alot of creativity but it was just kind of predictable and rock and rollish. I threw it away."
1,Skip it!,Very basic book that covers no new ground. Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book. You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.
1,OXO Fail.,"I love OXO. I thought they could do no wrong. But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money. We had an old stainless steel one without the handles, so I thought this one would work better. It does not work any better at all! The apple gets stuck in it, and it's a pain to clean."
2,useful,"Since I am partially disabled, this makes it easy to add some fruit to my diet. I don't only use it on apples."
2,Great corer/slicer for the price,"I have owned one of these before and am on my second one. This utensil has been used, abused, dishwashed, handwashed, used for Playdoh cutting, cookie cutting, chopping, etc. for about 6 years. I am happy it lasted as long as it did. It works great."
2,Awsome Set,Saw this show live and it was awsome! If you closed your eyes you'd have thought you went back in time 30 years. As tight as ever. They've lost NOTHING over the years (except maybe a little hair).
1,Don't Bother,This brush didn't last a month. The bristles are too soft and become deformed. I last used it when I steamed cleaned my barbeque grill and then tossed it.
2,"Not a review, but this will likely help others if a reply is received",Hoping one of the three reviewers of this product can help me out with info:Are these blades oiled or coated or not? Thanks in advance for any/all help!
2,Beyond The Shackles,"Gripping, passionate, moving - a story of courage and hope when life presented none of the above."
1,Agree that OXO could have done better,"PROS: Cuts well enough for my kitchen use; comfortable to grip w/extra large opening for fingers and no place to get my thumb stuck as has happened w/other scissors; fairly easy to take apart/assemble for cleaning & sharpening.CONS: The locking latch flipping into the locked position during use is a major flaw; the handles come completely together so you have to be careful not to get the skin of your palm pinched (trust me, it's very painful)."
1,Loose screw,"I received these shears as a gift. Shortly after the first use, the shears came apart. I looked in the drawer and found all the pieces and reassembled the shears. The middle screw is loose and doesn't completely tighten. Every time before I use the shears, I have to tighten the screw. After one time in the dishwasher, the metal spring was rusted. I'm shopping for new shears."
1,mine broke too - a stain upon the good reputation of OXO,"as an oxo-ite, i usually trust the OXO brand for quality; but no more.this multi grater broke - the plastic holding the large grate cracked into pieces on the lower left corner. almost as disappointing as my recent stock portfolio performance.their materials engineer, possibly a former AIG credit-default-swap analyst, needs to be sent back to engineering school for re-education.or mark the product - ""Safely Use Only with Velveeta or Tofu""caveat emptor, oxo-ites. long live MicroPlane!"
1,Way too flimsy!,"Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese. After writing this review, I'm going to order an all metal grater."
1,Broke After a few Uses,"I bought it because I thought the design was innovative and useful. It grated OK a few times, but the plastic frame holding the metal grate cracked at the corners and eventually broke."
2,excellent grater no problems,"Contrary to the claim of some other reviewers, this grater comes apart easily for cleaning. Mine has no cracks in the plastic and has worked very well for me the entire time I've had it. I strongly recommend it especially at the price its being sold for."
1,Worked well for a while...,"This grater was nice, but it is not constructed well. The plastic housing around the metal graters cracked within a year of minimal use. It was difficult to clean. And as others have said, it would have been better if it spread wider than it does. I typically love OXO products, but I have replaced this one with a solid steel grater. If you're looking for a grater that will last, look elsewhere."
1,Huh?,"After watching this movie, the biggest question in my mind is: Huh? What was the point of the film? I bought this expecting a film on the reality of following Jesus. There was only a cursory treatment of some of the issues that the church faces (i.e. church-goers vs. Jesus-followers). If I was a skeptic I could appreciate their honesty but there's nothing in it that would make me say ""OK I want to follow Jesus."" I also found their discussion about the opposite sex distracting from the message of the film. There were two positives however. The second-to-last chapter (Lucerne Switzerland) contains the most profound statement in the film. And it was pretty funny."
2,SACD's Rock,"Great disc originally and now even better. Sounds excellent at home on my SACD player, pretty good in the car. A bit bassey in the car but other than that a fine trade up from the original CD recording that was put out some 20 years ago. I have them both and play them side by side and can really hear the SACD difference. Well worth replacing the original and upgrading to SACD players!"
2,"Deserves Its ""Classic Album"" Status","Elton was so prolific at this point that he could release 5 studio albums in 3 years, a live album, a movie sound track and still have enough for a two record set. This one is a keeper, with songs that could have fit in on any of his earlier albums. (I'm thinking ""Danny Bailey"" and ""Roy Rogers"" on Tumbleweed Connection, and ""Harmony"" for Elton John, to name a few"") There are, of course, the obligatory monster singles ""Good Bye Yellow Brick Road,"" ""Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting,"" ""Benny And The Jets,"" and the single that never was ""Candle In The Wind."" What sets this album apart is the opening ""Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,"" an Elton staple in his 70's concerts. All in all, this is definitely his best."
2,Probably his best era,"In my opinion this is probably the best era for Elton John as well as many other musicians during that time. Not that I'm casting any doubt on the fine quality of his music in succeeding years, but this style of music with complex melodic arrangements and accompanying guitars to back his piano stylings heralds a time when music was an odyssey into the imagination."
2,The Best of Elton,"This is a landmark album for Elton John. It contains many memorable melodies and lyrics from one of rock and roll's most prolific and talented songwriting teams since Lennon and McCartney. Elton shows off his incredible piano abilities and tremendous voice on such varied songs as the gorgeous ""Candle in the Wind,"" and ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting."" Elton John has a way with writing compelling music to fit Bernie Taupin's unique lyrical style. This shows on standouts like the title track, and the infectious ""Bennie and the Jets."" Captain Fantastic lives up to his title on this LP. And be sure to catch Elton John live if you haven't already, he's even better in concert!"
2,The Greatest Album of All Time,"This is with out a doubt the most inspiring album that I have ever heard. To put it more simply, if I could own only one single album, this would be that album. Truely the high point of the genius that is Elton John."
2,Absolutely his best album,"This is Sir Elton at his finest. Before he turned too pop, this album ROCKS!! Aside from the hits, All the young girls love alice, dirty little girl, ive seen that movie too are really great songs possibly a sound you may not have heard from him yet, but will enjoy im sure. In my top 5 albums of all time."
2,Stunned at how good the sound on this SACD,I have many SACDs and DVD Audio discs but none hit me as hard as this one did. I was floored at the sound quality and the perfection of the mixing job for a 5.1 system. I never appreciated this album fully until now. Please get full range speakers for all 5 speakers to truly benefit from these SACD's.
2,So it's derivative... so what?,"Like at least these guys have good taste about who they borrow from. Heck they sound like the Beatles, the Velvet Underground, the Strokes, the Fall, Supertramp, Beck, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, the Stooges, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Tortoise, Joy Division, Flaming Lips, Os Mutantes, Television, Spoon, Neil Young, the Cure, Pavement(!) ect etc etc! It's not easy cramming so many influences into 37 minutes of music. And yet, trite as it may sound, they have a style unique unto themselves. Beautiful and creepy are pretty much unavoidable adjectives to use in describing this sound. This is up there for the best album of 2002."
1,"Dopey and charmless, but toddlers like it","Why are Spot videos so popular? It can't be for the chintzy animation, with mouths that don't move and cheesy computer paste-ons. It's not the story; there isn't one. Each segment is just a series of non sequiturs that occur in the same venue. Spot isn't educational; the videos don't teach anything concrete like numbers or shapes, and any socialization the videos show is bad (e.g. making fun of how fat Helen Hippo is). It can't be the voices (the same man and woman are obviously doing all the voices except Spot, with ridiculous accents and changes of pitch) or the dopey, repetitive music with inane lyrics. And it's not because Spot is so appealing; while he doesn't rival Barney for most annoying kids' character, Spot is boring and charmless. When there are fresh, original and delightful videos like the Maisy series, Blues Clues or even the old standby, Sesame Street, why bother with this drivel? Oh yeah, because my toddler likes it."
1,Zzzzzzz....,"My god....I picked this book up hoping for a well written, informative, in depth, description and analysis of what our special forces are doing in Afghanistan...What it seems to be is 200+ pages of griping, whining, and complaining about how a group of men didn't go out and get to kill people...It is filled with repetetive descriptions of driving here there and everywhere...more or less the book could have been boiled down to about 10 pages of relevent information and that would have sufficed...wouldn't bother to waste your time...you'd be far better off rereading Black Hawk Down or the like..."
2,Friendship triangles,"Everyone has experienced the rejection, or supposed rejection of a best friend. Simon feels his friendship with Molly is overshadowed by her friendship with Hester, the new girl in the neighborhood. A very real problem for children is brought to life in this tale of a friendship triangle. Jahn-Clough's illustrations are bright and cheerful when the children are playing and having fun, but become dark and foreboding when Simon questions his friendship with Molly."
1,Shameless and misleading,"ATTENTION AMAZON:I recently found out that this so called ""V. Productions / Ron Allen"" is none other than Richard Myles himself and that he goes around self promoting himself under aliases on various review boards and bashing his competition (see the scathing comments toward Chris .R. Notarile right here).Check out his reviews here on Amazon and you will see that in most cases, no matter what is being reviewed, it winds up being a glowing review of Richard Myles, his music or his movie ""Mental Scars"".Shame on you Richard Myles for misleading people and shame on you for all the hate toward Chris .R. Notarile as he was good enough to cast you in his fan film as Freddy Krueger."
2,The easiest grater,"This grater has the best design available. You squeeze the body of it while turning the knob on top (sort of like a peppermill with a turning handle). Makes light fluffy grated cheese easy, easy, easy."
1,Piece of Junk,"...the head twists off if you apply even the smallest amount of presure. On top of that, the soap pours out when the head twists off, because this is where you fill the dispenser."
1,god awful,"i purchased this camera on this site nearly a year ago. since that time, i've taken it on two major vacations (alaska and paris) and was dissappointed with the results. my friend and travel companion purchased disposable cameras and took better pictures than i did. a month ago, i went to montana on vacation and took pictures with the evoca. each one turned out with a bright halo like ring of light surrounding the boarder of the photo.....50% of the pictures were completely indistinguishable.i tested it again in las vegas with the same halo like result. so much for the high price tag and fancy lens...."
2,Don Camillo will pep you up to kick any rascals in humour,My home library contains some fabulous titles from Signor Guareschi. Over the years my wife and my brother and I have started guarding them with our lives. Particularly the above title. What a sublime humour and a bygone era. I went to Italy to see Palmar and the river Po. Made lot of Italian friends on that trip. Read Guareschi. Particularly the House that Nino Built.
1,RIP OFF!!!,This is nice looking and well made . . . with one exception. The wires break after very little use. I have two of these and have used them no more than half a dozen times (on medium to soft cheeses) each when the cutter wires broke. The rip off is that the replacement wires by the manufaturer cost another $14.00 for just three wires. Somebody's making some money here: but they won't get any more of mine.MOD
1,price too high for what you get,book was flimsey and the price on the book was less than I paid pretty sure it was a used book whats up with that?
2,Great cookbook,This is my frst cookbook by Jamie Oliver but it wont be my last.I enjoy his style of cooking which is about using healthy and good foods and making delicious but not complicated food.The cookbook itself is full of yummy color pictures of the dishes and was gorgeous just to look at.
2,Easy and colorful,"It's a great book, plenty if recipes really easy and with a lot of variety. It has influences from a lot of different countries and the plates are very healthy. A lot of good ideas."
2,This DVD is tropical HOT with crankin' music,I bought Hip Hop Bad Girls Brazil. This DVD is AWESOME!!!. The women have glorius rear ends and there are butts-a-plenty. I have never been teased better by a video than this one. The night time sky of Rio is breath taking in some of the shots and the women are strikingly beautiful. It's a very interesting concept. The hip hop tracks behind the booty is phat. This DVD is silicone-free unlike MOST DVD's of this type. All natural booty..uh..I mean beauty. Plus there are SO many upskirt teases and hot babes on the beach. More please... give me more.
2,Great...,"Great quality and a lower price, for me is like a tailored jean, I'm happy with this product. No more to say thanks to all"
1,bad fit,"they were too long and didn't fit the waist as advertized. the price was okay and the delivery was fine. overall, i was disappointed and would not repeat my order."
1,Not the same,"Ive been wearing Levi's over 40 years. These are not the same old Levi's! The fit is baggy, the sizing is not consistant, I bought 2 pair and they fit and wear are totally different. Probably won't buy any levi products again"
2,LIBERACE: AN AMERICAN BOY,"THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LIBERACE BOOKS. PUBLISHED BY, ST. MARTIN'S UNIVERSITY PRESS, IT DOES NOT FOCUS SO MUCH ON LIBERACE'S JEWELS, COSTUME ECT., BUT RATHER, WHAT EVENTS IN LIBERACE'S LIFE SHAPED THE PERSON HE WAS TO BECOME.HIS PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF 30 YEARS (RAY ARNETT) IS AN EXTREMELY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE FOR MANY YEARS NOW; HE ALSO LOVED THE BOOK"
2,GREAT MOVIE !!!,"I've always loved this movie. I think I originally saw it on H.B.O. late one night. The movie never got any recognition. That's probably why it was only showed at 3 A.M. Those time slots are usually reserved for movies that skipped the movie theatre and came straight to video. This movie is not available on D.V.D. (as of August 16th, 2003). It is also out-of-print on V.H.S. I had to buy a used copy of it on ebay. I'm hoping that one day it will be out on D.V.D., but that may never happen. I won't hold my breath. I won't get into the movie's plot either. You can look that up on the internet. I just wanted to say that I liked this movie a lot and wish more people latched onto it. Another good movie from the 1980's that got little attention, was the movie ""Ghosttown"". Check it out. It to, is not available on D.V.D. and is also out-of-print on V.H.S. You can get used copies of it on ebay also. Definitely check out ""Prison"". I think that you will enjoy it. I did."
2,Takes the Pain Out of Getting the Cork Out,"I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I do like a good Cab or Merlot on occasion. Until now I was opening my wine bottles with a free cork screw I got at the local liquor store. It's worked fine for years, you screw the corkscrew into the bottle, hold the bottle tightly and pull out the cork. It does require a little effort.But this baby requires none, you put over the top of the bottle, screw the skinny screw in, pull gently down on the levers and you've effortlessly opened your bottle."
1,strangely disappointing,"Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item, but right off the bat it seemed off-kilter somehow: the screw tended to go at an angle into the cork, making it hard to withdraw and more likely to break. I haven't had extensive experience with corkscrews; still, this one seems unnecessarily, even dangerously, sharp to me. There's a little round collar on the top that's supposed to keep the screw from wiggling around and it pops out of its socket a lot. The idea's a good one - the easy-to-grip parts and the size and so forth - but it doesn't seem to work well in practice. I've been struggling along with this for almost a year, but I think I'll try one of the wine waiter corkscrews now."
1,Oxo Corkscrew,"Don't waste you time and money on this corkscrew. It broke within the first week's use...good concept, but poorly constructed."
2,6 months - so far: Flawless,"I've been into sampling wine now for about 6 months. I read the reviews, looked at the prices, and decided to start with this device as a ""de-corker.""Well, by now I've decided that if I've got more money I want to spend, it's for wine not for a different corkscrew since this one has opened many bottles with zero failures.You line up the opener, turn the screw, watch the wings unfold, turn down the wings and the cork comes out with no problems. It has not yet failed to remove all of the cork, whole, with no fragments. It's fast, clean, relatively effortless, and cheap.I'm an obvious ""newbie"" to wine, but seriously - this thing is really underpriced. I'm ordering another for a backup."
2,Best Revenge: How Theater Saved My Life and Has Been Killing,"This is a terrific book. It's a great read, a marvelous look at the struggles of an artist trying to make a living in the theater, and a must buy for anyone who plans to make the theater his or her life."
1,I suppose I should have seen it coming,"Jars of Clay has gone from being a really good band, to being a really good christian band. Lyrically and muscially i find nothing moving about the eleventh hour. Perhaps my perspective is skewed because I want to hear something sonically comprable to their debut. Whatever the reason, the eleventh hour is a good cd, but nothing to marvel over. Maybe they will quit trying to be like other bands and go back to what they are good at...Sounding like Jars of Clay."
2,SHOCKS AND SURPRISES ABOUND,"Bestselling author Delinsky broadens her field with her latest by adding a touch of mystery to romance. Voice performer/director Sandra Burr offers a highly listenable reading to this tale of three women - one of whom is missing.Sisters Savannah and Susan are rivals, perhaps experiencing the sibling jealousies common to many, until they join forces to solve the kidnaping of Megan, a well-to-do mutual friend. As they begin to explore possibilities both are resistibly drawn to two very different men.Jared Snow is a late night disc. jockey with a voice that seduces; Sam Craig is a macho detective whom Susan cannot resist.Shocks and surprises abound as the investigation leads Savannah and Susan further into the discovery of dark machinations and deeper into the heart of love."
2,Hands Down,"My Favorite Common Album, good beats good lyrics nothing hardcore just a good album, my favorite song is THISISME!"
2,Resurrecting hip-hop,This is a great cd. I just got it and I have gotten addicted to this true style. Common showcases pure genuis in I used to love her. And book of life. Any one who loves hip hop should buy this cd.
2,Common,"Resurrection is an awesome album. Produced in 1994 it broke the mold of the gangsta rap that was so prevalent. A very musical album with songs your sure to play over and over again; Common's ""Resurrection"" is a must have."
2,Common is what Hip hop suppose to ...Be,"Ok, this CD is for Hip Hop heads only. If you like non-lyrical mc's and catchy hooks don't waste your time. Common is a throw back to times where the rap game was fun. On the classic track ""I Use To Love Her"", Common takes us on a journey threw the life of hip hop. This song will clearly remain timeless kind of like Will Smith's ""Summertime"" or Biggies ""Juicy"". You get the point! Anyway, Resurrection is filled with creative jams such as ""Watermelon"", ""Book of Life"", ""In My Own World"", and ""Communism"". This MC brings us into his crazy little world where he allows us to laugh as well as cry. Common is one of the reasons hip hop fans can feel secure b/c the new fads will can never change an individual who loves the art so much.....thanks for the Classict-hanes"
2,Buy This Album At All Costs!,"This C.D. is unquestionably one of the best hip-hop albums ever. If anything has ever qualified as a must-buy then it is ""Resurrection"". In fact it was my favorite album until Mos Def's ""Black on Both Sides"" came out. Now I like both but in different ways. While Mos Def's C.D. is a masterpiece in it's creativity and sound, Common's is a masterpiece in it's story-telling and personality. This album seems like it's talking directly to you like nothing else I've ever heard (except maybe ""One Day......"") Whereas you might respect and want to meet Mos Def after hearing his album, you'll truly feel like you really know Common after listening to this.If you loved ""One Day....."" by Common, and are considering buying this one, but find yourself worried that it'll only seem like a let down, think again. This album in my opinion is his best work. His new one, ""Like Water For Chocolate"" is supposedly coming out March 2000, here's hoping that after that day I'll have a new favorite!"
2,Too funky!,"FOXY BROWN is my favourite Pam Grier movie (with COFFY a close second and JACKIE BROWN third). This soundtrack opens with a bang with the instrumental CHASEand then never lets up. Brimming with funk, sass and attitude, this is a 70s gem that's too good to miss."
1,* WARNING: THIS BOOK'S BEST USE IS AS A DOOR STOP! *,"...so S T O P; don't buy this book. It's Junk. Anyone who's been in the profession a while knows it because many of us received it as a Designer's Book Club intro title in the late 80's or early 90's. It wasn't worth the cost of its S&H! Ask around to people in the profession and look it over first. I received mine while having just a few years of experience in practice. Initally excited and impressed with myself having identifed a clear technical error, my feelings quickly changed to surprise and then anger as I began to realize the whole book was packed w/ errors and critical omissions. It was generally a frustratingly incompetent presentation with widely incomplete information on its proposed subjects. That the editors and publisher let this trash out, and were, I presume, making their livings with this level of incompetence was disheartening."
1,Piece of Junk,"Installed this on a new build and immediately the fan started spinning loudly and to think this unit is supposed to keep things quietly. The following day, the system would not boot up at all due to a Thermal Control Module (TCM) that went bad overnight. I tried calling CoolIt Systems technical support line and someone is supposedly calling me back. Well, I been waiting for over a week now and still no return call. Will try again."
2,Excellent jazz!,Heard some of this cd on a nightly jazz program (local NPR). Ordered it immediately. it arrived early and was in excellent shape.
2,"The Don Ellis ""Farewell"" Recording","Live at Montreux (1978) was Ellis's final recording. This recording offers reflections of the more adventurous Ellis ensemble recordings on selections such as ""Future Feature,"" ""Sporting Dance,"" and ""Niner Two."" However the disco-influenced ""Go-No-Go"" indicates Ellis's continued connection to popular styles. The selection ""Open Wide"" enjoyed some degree of popularity with its 4/4 meter and accessible main theme (somewhat reflective of Chuck Mangione's hit ""Feel So Good""). Despite the conventional meter, the selection also represents an excellent example of Ellis's rhythmic superimpositions 5 beats over a 4/4 barline.Live at Montreux demonstrates a more-restrained use of Ellis's trademark ""odd"" meters, but makes up for it with a more-liberated use of extremely sophisticated rhythmic superimpositions."
1,Does not grab,This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs. The point is sharp.
2,Excellent clips / very sturdy,"These clips are excellent - brightly colored, high quality, and they grip onto anything."
1,Cheaper Alternative,"I don't mean to be a stick in the mud, but why spend this much for 4 of these, when you can buy a huge pack (50 or more) of wooden clothespins for less than $3.00? I've been using them as chip-clips, cereal bag clips, cookbook page holders, etc. for years. and they never break. Don't buy the colored plastic ones - wood ones are best. I keep them in a little wire bin in my junk drawer, and never have to hunt."
1,IT TAKES A THIEF,"AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUTH PRICE IS!THAT LITTLE JAZZ CLUB THAT RUTH OWNS (THAT SHE PASSES OFF AS) ANON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS ANYTHING BUT NON-PROFIT. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WOMEN WHO CALLS HERSELF A MUSICIAN, AND YET RIPS OFF EVERY MUSICIAN WHO PASSES THROUGH THE JOINT. SHE IS NOT WORTHY OF ANY FORM OF RESPECT, BECAUSE SHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HARD WORKING STRUGGLING MUSICIANS, WHOM SHE NICKELS AND DIMES TO DEATH. THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM, AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME!"
1,Low rating is for the Afterword,"I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson.This afterword, however, of Jerome Charyn's is almost more than I can bear.I'll be frank. Is this an afterword with supposed insightful information into the nuances of the story, and or the writer/period/genre, or a freakin book report. Kids, if you're buying this book for class, get this edition and don't even bother reading the actual story if you're not interested. Skip to the very back and you'll find all the multi-paragraph quotes you can handle, as well as rambling general encyclopaedic info on Robert Louis Stevenson.I think I wrote an ""essay"" exactly like this as a freshman in highschool english class and received a C for lack of creativity and effort. That's not exactly a compliment for you Mr. Charyn."
2,"""Scary"" Book",I thought this book was pretty good. This book was a great English thriller who horrified the English people in old England. I gave the book four stars because at some points it got confusing. The book was meant to be scary but today it is nothing compared to what we have today. The story is about a man name Dr. Jekyll who creats a potion to turn him into another man named Mr. Hyde so he can do his dirty work. The book is suspenseful and is a great mystery. The surprise ending and constant suspense builds this book up to be a pretty good book. This book could have been better if it had more mystery and more action. I also think the book could have been written in 10 pages or less (this book is for everybody who peeks at the end before finishing). Other than that I would recomend it to mystery and horror lovers.
1,huh,Don't remember getting this. Good book regardless. Guess it was from a mobile app. Anyways I do recommend it still. Enjoy
2,A Brilliant Story! READ IT.,"Stevenson draws you deeper and deeper into this chilling tale of a frightening addiction. Dr. Jekyll is a man exploring the soul, who discovers something hidden inside himself. This book weaves artfully around the always horrific subject of the evil within us all. Stevenson's beautiful language and imagery envelopes us in his mind, holding us frozen until the very last page. This story is as magnifcant as it is eerie. I loved this book. READ IT.Afterward, you may not want to look too closely into the mirror..."
2,Just so you know,"The book was great in my opinion. But it is slow as is the case with other books written in this time period, and it's not written from Dr. Jekyll's point of view but from his friend's. And things that are in the musical (i.e. Dr Jekyll's love interest) are not in the book. But other than that I say that it's a book everyone should read at least once. :)"
2,A book that has stood the test of time,"Who hasn't heard of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Whether it be in Newspaper reports of daily conversation, references to these two characters ensure that nearly everyone in the English speaking world has at least heard of this story. The number of people, who have read the book, is much less however and until recently I wasn't among them.Having read the book, I cannot recommend it strongly enough. Stevenson deals with the dual nature of `man' and his (or her) battle within himself. The plot is quite simple and it may have been this simplicity that gave the story its popularity. It could also have been Stevenson's skillful usage of the English language, which makes reading this book such a pleasure.The only bad thing about this book is its brevity. Do yourself a favor and read it."
2,Timeless,"This is a great classic. This story brings to life the battle each one of us has within ourselves. Dr. Jekyll calls it his ""dualtiy of purpose"". The struggle of good versus evil; told in that colorful language of classics."
2,A Good Quick Read,"Mr. Hyde is a known murderer. Dr. Jekyll is a honorable doctor in the scientific community. These people's lives should never cross, but why is Hyde the heir of Dr. Jekyll. This book by Robert Luis Stevenson ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", focuses on the duality of man and Jekyll's beleif that the evil in a man can be seperated from the good. This classic book can be read in as little as an hour and is a peice of literature that can surprise you in many ways. This book is not wriiten as poetry and as hard to read as The Odessy or Shakespeare. This book will make you think"
1,Some parts are good,"I like the demos by one of the presenters that showed some of Brian's guitar ""tricks"", but the rest was ho-hum."
2,"the ""ultimate"" edition for superheroes.","I own the single books from Dini/Ross teamup. Great books. They capture the essence of each character to build upon it a very meaningful and clever tale. Nothing to add about the art: Ross is well known and always getting better and better, with panels as evocative as the prose. The hardcover edition is the perfect way to enjoy these masterpieces (even if a bit heavy to handle.....). But if you are looking for extra material (as the new edition of Mythology) you could be disappointed."
1,This Book is Nonsense,"This book is misleading.According to geneticist Cavalli-Sforza's research, the genetic distance between Anglo-Saxons and the Irish is less than 1. They are extremely closely related. Both northern Celtic and Germanic tribes had been closely related for a very long time. Contrast this relatedness, for example, to people who are not related. The genetic distance separating the English from the Japanese is 59. The genetic distance of the English from Sub-Saharan blacks is 109.I think you get the picture.Ignatiev is unreliable as a ""scholar."" This is the same author who once said: ""We intend to keep bashing the dead white males, and the live ones, and the females too, until the social construct known as `the white race' is destroyed,not `deconstructed' but destroyed.""His hatred of European Americans (whites) belies his own research."
1,What next?,Blame a victim anyone? I will say nothing about the author's motives. Perhaps this one will be posted. Posted on 5-12-07.
2,The ratings on this book speak to how important it is...,"Noel Ignatiev's well-researched and well-argued book is incredibly important to understanding the way race has been constructed in the United States and the way that white people are deeply involved in that racial hierarchy - whether they want to be or not. Looking at the reviews of the book it is clear that many of my fellow white people are incredibly uncomfortable with these realities, but their discomfort only proves the point of how important this book really is. Cycles don't change unless we interrupt them, and this book is one such interruption. Hopefully more of us will be willingly to interrupt the current cycle of white supremacy (through colonialism/capitalism/patriarchy/cis-hetero-normativity, and the white-middle-class-ideal that Ignatiev deconstructs so artfully in this book) and not defend it by turning away from the role we play in it."
2,heavenly chime,this chime has so much sound. It resonates in the air for longer than I had expected. Definetely worth the value. Good Buy! :)
1,Incorrect Movie,This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.
1,Simplified 12-Step Program,"We used this in my recovery group and I found it more than useless to anyone who can read at a high school level or above. It's a very simplified version of the 12-step programs repackaged. Now, for adults who aren't all that literate, it may be a good book. There are a ton of examples to help explain the concepts (obviously not true examples, but written specifically for the book) and silly pictures more suited for kids, but they at least break up the blocks of reading into manageable chunks.Otherwise, it's a pass. I learned more from the bookRecovery Options: The Complete Guidethan I did during my two months in group, and its just a description of all treatment options (without being ANY treatment program). Now that's just sad."
1,spun out after only a month,"I had been happily using a very inexpensive salad spinner purchased at IKEA for about ten years. It finally gave out when the plastic part on the inside began to break. I was ready to replace it and thought I might even get something that would be easier to use. I read the reviews for the OXO spinner and thought it sounded great. However, when I got it, it did not spin as well as my old one from the very beginning and by the end of the first month was spinning so slowly that the letttuce was still very damp, even after very vigourous pumping up and down of the handle. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Sorely disappointed,"This was on my wishlist for a sometime. I love salads, but hate trying in vain to dry washed lettuce with a mountain of paper towels. I finally had enough and after once again perusing the reviews, ordered what I was sure would be the answer to my wet lettuce woes. When it arrived, I immediately gave it a test drive. I was skeptical about the spinning action (as it didn't seem fast enough to be able to really spin dry), but I was still hopeful as I rinsed some lettuce, tossed it in, and plunged away. Some of the water spotted the sides of the bowl, but most of it remained on the leaves. I recalled some reviews advising throwing in a paper towel or two for drier lettuce, so I did. Still no cigar. The paper towls remained dry and the leaves wet.I simply don't understand how this product has garnered such positive reviews. After sufficiently frustrating me, this salad spinner went right back to amazon and I'm right back to drying lettuce by paper towel. Sorely, sorely disappointed."
1,Piece of Junk,This thing is a piece of junk. When you try to spin it fast enough to get the water off it jams up. Dont waste your $$$
2,Oxo Salad Spinner,Oxo Good Grips Salad SpinnerI don't know why I waited so long to order this. It's absolutely wonderful.
1,Used 3 months than it cracked!,"I bought this because it was a small size for storage. First it doesn't spin out real well because of design. Second after about 8 uses the top cracked! I never put it into the dishwasher. Would I buy it again? NO. Can I return it? NO, I have owned it for 3 months."
1,order never recieved,"Ordered From Amazon, They pawned it off to another company that sent it to the wrong address. when called they say it was delivered so to bad. I will never buy from AGAIN"
1,Recommended cleaning resulted in broken product,"I'm very disappointed by how easy it was to break the lid when trying to disassemble it GENTLY to follow the cleaning instructions provided with the product. Its spinning ability seems to deteriorate with weekly use after the first month. Cheap! I will NEVER use this model, or any OXO salad spinner again."
2,What did I do without it,"I love it. I use it for all the greens we get in our ""greens share."" Herbs, lettuce. Easy to use. Good for storage. Very easy to clean."
1,Can't get my greens dry!,"I bought this spinner because of the great reviews but I'm having a big problem in that I can't seem to get my lettuce dry. No matter how many times I've spun it there still seems to be a fair amount of visible water. Based on the reviews I expected to get ""crisp, dry"" lettuce. My lettuce is crisp but not dry and I'm afraid that if I put it into the fridge as is it will get bad fast.So what am I doing wrong? I've tried adding a couple (or more) paper towels - that didn't help. I've tried putting less lettuce, that didnt help either. btw I'm talking about a large salad for one person. I've also tried draining it on my drainer.If anyone knows what I should or shouldnt be doing please let me know; else I'm going to have to return it :-(Bernard"
2,Salad spinner review,"Very good quality spinner. Large capacity (not easy to store if you have a small kitchen) makes it easy to wash and dry two large heads of Boston lettuce. Also used to wash herbs, vegetables and fruit. The spinner lid (with the knob) is pushed down and the interior basket spins. There is a brake button to stop the spinning if you're in a hurry. There is a little lock so that you can keep the knob in the ""down"" position for easier storage. Also comes with a flat lid so it can be used to store other things, both refrigerated and not. The base of the bowl has a rubberized rim so that the unit won't dance all over your countertop when you spin the contents. Solid construction and well engineered."
1,OXO OKO,"The spinner works well, but be sure you have enought room to store it. I haven't used a spinner before and found it to be large, clunky, and hard to store."
2,Great Spinner - could use a seperate lid,"I originally purchased this salad spinner back in 2006 and used it regularly. A few weeks ago, it finally broke (probably just wear & tear). I bought the same one (with clear lid) and using it again. Nothing much changes in the last years except use of clear plastics.My only recommendation would be for OXO to include a flat plastic lid. I usually keep my salad in the spinner (fridge) once washed, but the shape of the lid makes it take a lot of space in fridge and won't allow staking."
2,Take your salad for a spin...,"This is a great kitchen item to have, it really gets out the extra water and allows your favorite dressing to cling to the salad. A must have at a great price."
2,Really good product!,Great salad spinner! Sooo much better than my electric one. The bottom stays still while spinning. And it really gets all the water off my lettuce.
2,friends request an it was perfect,it was just what she wanted and came fast. she had not been able to find it anywhere in local stores
2,outstanding spinner!!!!,I LOVE MY SALADS!! I;M VERY PICKY ABOUT WASHING MY SPINACH BEFORE I CREATE MY SALAD. THIS OXO IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SPINNERSI EVER USED . IF YOU LIKE SALADS LIKE I DO . YOU NEED TO GET THIS OXO LETTACE SPINNER.C.INFUSINOCHICAGOLAND
2,A great way to spin sprouts,"My primary purpose for this purchase was to spin sprouts. Seems silly, but my other spinners were unsuitable due to the hole size. This is easy to use and doesn't take up too much space in the cupboard. For more info on using a spinner for the sprouts, visit sproutpeople.org"
1,Not A Great Way To Get Acquainted With The Pixies,"""Surfer Rosa"" and ""Doolittle"" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation, but it's nowhere near as cohesive or brilliant as those early masterpiece albums, which are filled to the brim with awesome material and arranged perfectly. In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not. Pixies were an album band, and compilations only degrade their impact."
2,This band is amazing,"This album has everything and more. This is a complilation of some of the best Pixie songs ever written, and Kim Deal with her ever so intoxicating voice kicks ass."
2,Good vibrations,The sound of these chimes is soothing and very rich for the size of the unit. I am very pleased with the mood that it sets.
2,It will be hard to beat this one.,"This is my favorite CD, and I highly reccomend it. What I think is the theme that really holds this soundtrack together is the ark theme. It is very atmospheric, creepy and interesting. In the movie there is a big popularity over the ark, but Indiana Jones is probably the only one to realize that it could be dangerous and this theme perfectly defines how mysterious this object is. The moral of this movie is leave God alone, and in the end of the movie you'll see why. Now I'm talking about the new digitally remastered version that is really good and I found out that most of the tracks were previously unreleased and I don't know how this soundtrack could be a soundtrack without those tracksDesert Chase has the best chase scene music ever. If you like John Williams, take my advice."
1,"I Admire West Point, But This Does Not Live Up To The Hype","I was disappointed. After all the hype, I thought this was a substantial work, but it isn't. It is mostly pictures. The pictures are nice but it offers nothing, and text-wise, not enough of it for the price. I'm sorry to say this about Westpoint, but I somewhat resent being misled. It could have taken me but 5 minutes to flip through it at a bookstore to see it was not for me."
2,What scares the hell out of *you*?,"""Scare Tactics"" is bone-chilling and creepy. Without much ado it grabs you by its deadly fascination right from the start and will not let you go until you turn to the final page. With colourful descriptions, which will vivily live in your imagination for some time, Elizabeth Manz manages to draw the reader into this world of fear, suspense and horror. I worked out theories what might happen on the next page but I was wrong all the time. A powerful language carries on with the story, makes you suffer with and fear for the main characters. ""Scare Tactics"" is excatly that what the title promises. I highly recommend this book simly because it scared the hell out of *me*."
1,This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour.,"We purchased this book in preparation for a road trip in Spain. The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose. The descriptions of locations and drives are scanty and the photos look about 25 years old. This time, the cover sold the book and the inside does not live up to it!"
2,PSX best console ever!,"The Playstation is by far the best console that i have ever played, sure the N64 is good and some of my friends say it's the best but none of it's game are nearly as lastable or as overall good compared to playstation (except some gun games such as Golden eye) i don't have a playstation yet though i am getting one very soon. You might not think i have a strong view point on the matter as i don't own one but i have certainly played them alot at friends houses and stuff, for instance i was at my friends house once and i was sleeping over and we played tony hawke's pro skateboarding for about 6 hours straight. Although i have yet to to play dream cast and PSX2 is not yet out in my country i believe that PSX1 is a masterpiece. my opinion Jamieson"
2,I think that this game console is one of the best!,"I thought that this game console has great graphics and the amount of entertainment and fun theat you can get out of your money i amazing. Although it is slower than nintendo 64, playstation can give you better graphics and more reality. The new sega dreamcast seems like it is a waste of money compared to playstation it is just expensive and pathetic. Playstation is priced reasonably and the games are not sixty dollars. I would reccomend playstation to anyone. Nintendo and dreamcast sound like fun but are not as easy on your wallet!"
2,PSX: Still the best option,"The PlayStation has been beaten out in the hardware race by the PC, Sega Dreamcast, and [some say] the N64. However, the PlayStation is still the best overall system on the market.There is no better deal, and the N64 can only match this price, not better it. Also, the CDs the PSX uses are much cheaper than the cartridges of the N64. This system is the most inexpensive to own and use.Secondly, the games are as good or better than those of other systems. For the Mario, Zelda, and F-Zero of N64, Sony has Gran Turismo 1 and 2, the Syphon Filters, the Resident Evil series, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasies, Dino Crisis, Tekkens .. more of the best games are still only on PlayStation."
2,Very fun system with lots to do!,"This is a very good system to have. It provides many, many hours of entertainment for all ages. It is strong and durable too. If it is on with no game, there is also a memory card or CD player possibility. There are many features and options available. This is a great system and a must get."
1,"BJBichon on ""My Parrot, My Friend""","This book was recommended by another bird site as the only book you will ever need to understand your bird. I think I was expecting too much. It reads a little like a clinical tome; too many words, too little said. Yet, the monochromatic photos and diagrams, editing errors, and misspelled words cause you to question the credibility."
2,I love this coring set!,The corer is wonderful. It takes some pressure from the user to work (obviously) but it cuts the apple into perfect sections and the corer itself cleans up very easily. We are very happy with our purchase.
2,"Not all Christmas-themed, but still nice for the holidays","---------------------------------------------------""Angelina Ballerina Holiday Gift Set""(Hit Entertainment, 2011)---------------------------------------------------This 3-DVD box set is billed as a holiday collection, although not all of the episodes are Christmas related. It includes on holiday episode, ""The Nutcracker Sweet,"" but also a bunch of regular old Angelina episodes where she tries out for big parts and learns to get along with family and friends. We were big fans of the original Angelina Ballerina books, though the videos didn't have quite the same feel. But if you're searching for a present for younger girly-girl Angelina fan, this set has a lot of content - over three hours worth of stories! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)"
1,CCR OPD,"This is one bad album from the once great band. Well, as a quartet C.C.R. never made a bad album, but as a trio; they stunk! The trios live album ""Live In Europe"" was a fake (see my review) and their one studio work was a bad joke. I bet Tom Fogerty was laughing at this release. By 1972, Creedence was officially pronounced dead!01. Lookin' for a Reason - 4/1002. Take It Like a Friend - 1/1003. Need Someone to Hold - 3/1004. Tearin' Up the Country - 4/1005. Someday Never Comes - 10/1006. What Are You Gonna Do? - 3/1007. Sail Away - 1/1008. Hello Mary Lou - 5/1009. Door to Door - 5/1010. Sweet Hitch Hiker - 10/10The ""20 Bit Mastered"" sound is wonderful, but why would anyone want a polished turd.The best songs are available on Chronicles 1 & 2. Sweet Hitch Hiker and Someday Never Comes are on Volume one. While Hello Mary Lou and Lookin' For A Reason are unexplainably on Volume two."
1,Agree with previous reviewer,"I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although, my problem with the holster is that I have it clipped to my belt but the holster sometimes comes off by itself and I blame this on the design. All you have to do to get the case off is turn it 90 degrees and pull up. I have a PDA case with a similar design but it requires you to push a lever to have the case come off and it has never accidentally come of because of that lever. I have had the Siemens case come off many times when I was sitting and yesterday it came off on the street when I was reaching for something. It's a good thing a good samaritan found my phone and contacted me or else I would be out a phone. This is a good case if you don't plan on keeping the case on your belt but if you do I would look for something else. I currently have a Krusell case on order to replace this one. After yesterday's incident I don't plan on using it anymore."
2,Great quality,"What can you say about OXO products, they're great. These are easy to use, go in the dishwasher for complete cleaning and are easy to handle. If they break or if there is an issue, OXO stands behind their products."
2,Would buy again..,"I use tongs for just about everything I do in the kitchen. The rubber handles make these tongs one of my top rated kitchen items. They can get greasy or wet and they still won't slip. Another bonus to is that the rubber on these help heat and cold resistance. I use this alot to turn food in the oven and they haven't burned me once. They also grab small items, that my other tongs have a problem grabing.The one thing I don't like about these tongs is the way they lock. You have to pull on the bottom to lock them. And push in to open. On my other tongs, there is a clasp that slides up and down the handle, those are much easier to use while cooking. With these you have to use two hands to close. One to hold the handle and the other to pull the little clasp thingy closed. Doesn't sound like a big deal, until you're cooking and in a hurry and trying to close them while getting food out of the oven or whatnot.But given the chance, I would buy them again."
2,Sturdy with a great locking mechanisim,"These tongs a little more expensive, but they won't ""twist"" on you the way that cheaper tongs will when you try to pick up and flip a heavier item. The great locking mechanisim, which means never having to deal with sliding rings again, is worth the price of admission. I've used these tongs (and their longer 16"" cousins) for everything, including grill duty, for about 3 years and they're just as good as new."
1,Does not live up to expectation,"I'm a big fan of OXO Good Grips products -- my peeler, ice cream scooper and wine opener have served me well. This can opener was my latest purchse, and it has not lived up to the OXO name. After a few uses the blade seemed to lose its sharpness. After probably less than 50 uses, the can opened failed to work complete (blade become misaligned, perhaps). Next time it's back to the Zyliss for me!"
1,"Lock broke, but it's still comfortable","I'm glad to know I'm not the only one with a busted lock -- lasted maybe 1-2 months. However, true to Oxo form, the handles are still much more comfortable than any other can opener I've used (thus, 2 stars instead of 1)."
2,delivered as described,I bought this book for my son who is reading it in school. It was in the condition described. Used very good. The kids in his class seem to like the book. Bandix delivered it quickly
2,A very funny book.,I think this is a great book to read. I enjoyed it a lot. Kids should read this book because it is funny when Matilda uses her powers. It is about a little girl who wants to go to school but her father won't let her. So she plays jokes on him with her powers until he finally lets her go to school.
2,Praise for Matilda,"I would give four stars to Matilda by Roald Dahl. This book is a 4 star book because it was very interesting but not the best book I have read.Matilda is a genius child with idiotic parents who are very mean to her. They do not care about Matilda at all they think she is not intelligent and that they are. At school Matilda has to deal with Miss ""The"" Trunchbull, a very cruel and horrid headmistress with an attitude. The only comfort Matilda has is her teacher Miss Honey and they share a very big secret about Matilda. I very much like this book but as I said it is not my favorite book. I like books more like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" Roald Dahl is a very gifted writer who has many other funny children's stories. Books I recommend by Roald Dahl: ""James And The Giant Peach "", ""Matilda"", ""The Twits"", ""The BFG"". My favorite part of this book was when Matilda put the super glue in her dad's hat."
2,Matilda,Do you know some one who is smart and could do magic? I read the book Matilda. It was about a girl named Matilda. She was very smart and she was magical. It all happened in Worn wood's house. Every morning Matilda's mom would go to bingo and her brother would go to school every morning. Her mom would leave her alone. By that time she would know how to take care of herself. As you can see her mom would not take care of her. When she turned 4 years old she already knew how to read. Matilda's dad would work as a crook and he didn't care about school or reading a book instead he would stay watching T.V. I recommend this book because it is an interesting book and a funny book. I don't want to give the rest so if you want to find more about the book why don't you read the book!
2,Great story,"Such a great story for little girls today. It's not about being the prettiest girl or having an attitude, but about adventure and standing up for yourself. Highly recommended."
2,Matilda,"I think this is a great book for kids at age 10 to 13 or 14. I really like this book because it is very interesting and magical.I think that it is much better than the movie or DVD because it has some different information than the movie. I don't understand why they change some parts from the book into the movie. Well any ways Matilda is a very great, interesting, and magical book.By:Ashley"
2,The Ups and Downs of Matilda,"Matilda was a very smart girl and learned to read much faster than the other kids. She acctually wanted to go to school, but when she got there, she found her worst enemy, the Trunchbull. Matilda used her mental powers to get rid of the Trunchbull. The book was sad because of the way her parents treaded her, but it was good how Ms. Honey and Matilda became friends"
2,Really nice fit. Simple as that.,"I'm super peculiar when it comes to Jeans. I can't stand anything that's skin-tight. Can't stand inseams that squeeze my ... gonads. But I'm not into the ultra saggy, baggy look either. So, it's pretty damn impossible for me to buy a pair of jeans. Recently I bought a similar model to this one at local retailer and was very much impressed with the look and fit. As soon as I realized that after so long I had found a pair of jeans that met my needs I came to amazon to buy these. Son, I'm not disappoint. These jeans fit nicely. Very nice as a matter of fact. lots of leg room, nice inseam length, and nice fit from the waist to the end of your pockets. If you got yourself a small beer belly, I highly suggest buying one full size larger than you usually get. Otherwise, at least for me, these jeans are perfect."
1,aunt bam's,"The quality of the dvd was excellent, but that was not one of tyler's best works. The movie wasn't as funny as some of his other movies or plays."
1,No No and No.,Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.
2,great message,great job Tyler loved this. this is a great play that a lot of single moms needs to see if some ppl stop putting so much energy into their ex life maybe they can move on with life
1,"Too Firm, too obstructive.","There may be some situation where this product may work well, but in a shower it does not. The handle is so curved that it obstructs contact with the glass. The rubber part of the squeegee is also very firm which doesn't allow full contact with the glass. I wouldn't recommend."
2,WHATS REALLY GOIN ON!,THE BEST OF ALL TIMES (AND TO THINK THIS WAS RELEASED JUST 7 DAYS AFTER I WAS BORN)! THE ALBUM COVER SAYS IT ALL.
2,Such A Rich History Behind This Release -- A MUST HAVE,"As a huge Marvin Gaye fan, I have virtually everything he released. And although I have the original versions of ""I Want You"" and ""What's Going On"", I didn't have the deluxe editions. After reading Michael Eric Dyson's ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Art and Demons of Marvin Gaye)"", (in part of which he gives an in depth look at how these deluxe editions came about), I decided that I needed to have them. After learning the history behind the releases of these editions, I am awestruck. Both are truly timeless classics, works of art that cannot be dismissed. Now that these have been published, I hope that a whole new generation of folks are enlightened to Mr. Gaye's genius."
2,to all haterz,who ever alblum was lame ur lame to that dude said this worst album 2 u eat a fat d**k
2,More than a woman...!,"Aaliyah is more than a woman! She's an angel! Her voice, and music is great. I reccomend you buy this C.D. today!My favorite songs?: More than a woman, and Rock the boat!"
2,Aaliyah's Best Album Ever!!,"I've always been a fan of Aaliyah. Her personnality seemed so down to earth. Through the years I watched her grow from a young teen into a beautiful woman. You never really heard much about her personnal life because she wasn't the type to put herself out there like that. That's what I loved about her the most. She always stayed on the ""DOWN LOW."" Her third album is the best album ever. From beginning to end. Even though I never met her I wish I could of had the chance to tell her how much her music changed my life and how proud I was of her.You will be deeply missed LIYAH! R.I.P. Babygirl."
2,Girl to Woman,"Aaliyah has definitely grown up. The songs are about love, hurt, pain, sex...etc. The songs are more sensual than her usual style. My favorite track is ""Rock the boat"", then ""I care for you"", then ""I Refuse"". I am a huge Aaliyah fan.... Keep up the good work baby girl..........."
1,good singles but this is album is lacking!,"i Think Aaliyah is talented but i would not call this album one of the best cd's i've ever heard. although the songs like ""rock the boat"" and ""more than a woman"" are really good the rest of the album is (sorry Aaliyah)very lacking, i could even call alot of the songs fillers. I don't think this cd is worth the money, my advice is to get the singles or download the good songs off the filesharing service.ps. i hope they bring out a best of or greatest hits Aaliyah cd, coz i'll be getting that one if it comes out."
2,"""A"" Is For Aaliyah!!!","How should I say this? Aaliyah has come a long way since the year of 1994 with her debut album, ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"" and since then, she's been a wonderful female singer who was down to earth and beautiful. With this album ""AALIYAH"", she has done a fantastic job on recording this album with each track that are Cool and lovely, and her voice is just remarkable, and the song ""We Need A Resolution"" (featuring Timbaland), is awesome, and it is one of the best tracks on this album ""AALIYAH""."
2,Aaliyah at her best,"This CD truly shows Aaliyah at her very best. Her trademark fallseto voice is displayed, along with a vocal range that I never knew that she posessessed. I thoroughly enjoyed every song on this album, but my favorites are ""More than a Woman"", ""Rock the Boat"", and ""Resoulution"". I fell in love with Aaliyah when I listened to the song ""Try Again"", and this album goes well above and beyond what I expected. Though Aaliyah is not with us anymore, I know that she knew this CD was her best."
2,BANGIN BEATS,This album was a great contribution to the current state of music. Aaliyah's music was never one to be in the normalcy but she really blew us away with this album. She showed us her womanly attitudes and she shared her sexiness with us in a real classy way. I like this album and will keep it in the stereo for a while.
1,keepin it real,"Yo she was an o.k. singer, but she was no acter. Her new c.d. was wack and everyone knows that. Just because she is no longer with us everyone feels the need to lie and not keep it real. She was tight nahh I'm lying, she was wack and couldn't write a song at all. I think every hit song was written by someone else. She never did tell the truth about her and R.Kelly, that is when she was tight. RIP---Aaliyah"
1,Is he running out of subjects to write books on,"This author has over 20 different books. I have read afew and found them to be consistant in quality, that being low, very low. I find it hard to believe that mortimer is an expert in all these programs (after effects, lightwave, 3d max, poser, bryce, ect.)but it is realistic to assume that he mediocre on all of them. Spend your money on a professional who uses the product every day, rather then on some guy who opened up the program the day before his book was due to the publisher."
1,Stuffy,Published in 1955 - I have never ever cared for this volume and until I read The Mystery of The Aztec Warrior thought it was the worst in the series. To me I always found it a suffocating book and I can't explain why. Tony plays a prominent role in this one and to the books credit at least they encounter the criminals a fair amount and there is a little action. The latter chapters were fairly decent. Its worth reading - once -but honestly compared to the other volumes in my opinion this is among the cellar dwellers. (Almost a 2 Star - but not quite) RATED D
2,Woodstock Emperor Gong Chime,"This wind chime is beautifully constructed of high quality materials. It has a very low, zen-like chime and would be a wonderful addition to any garden or home."
2,Blazing hot,"Of all the young artists who are now over produced, canned and sent forth, Kelly Osbourne rises above with this album. Her strong, emotional voice and the witty, gritty writing of the material she chose makes a strong statement. The talented studio artists give her the stage she needs to shine. Not just the daughter of an icon, Kelly has her own major talent and career ahead. Go girl, rock forth."
2,Real Music !!!! and an amazingly gifted Singer---GREAT CD !!!,"I have been so disappointed in music lately....drum machines on top of drum loops...and rehashed samples...etc....hardly any ""real"" musicians on most current popular music....basically music with no soul or feeling to it.....This new CD by the Brand New Heavies is just what the current state of music needs right now !!!! A real band, with an amzingly talented singer- N'Dea Davenport. N'Dea sounds great, and the band and tracks are funky as hell ! IF you are a Brand New Heavies fan you will not be disappointed...if you never listened to the Brand New Heavies before, buy this CD and get educated oh how ""Real"" music sounds and feels !"
1,Not good for scrubbing,"Too soft, reach bottom of container but brush is so soft at tip make cleaning very difficult. Would not buy"
2,Amazing brush,I started using this as a general pre dishwasher scrub brush based on another Amazon review I saw on this product. I also use it to clean the sink and to clean out my recycling cans and bottles. It is the best overall cleaning brush I have ever used. The long flexible handle allows access to almost any item. I pop it in the dishwasher periodically and even the most stubborn food items come off - things like scrambled eggs and bread dough. It has held up well under heavy daily use for the last three months. And that is a record for me as I'm pretty hard on cleaning tools. I just added it as a permanent item on my shopping list.
2,Extra arm!,"It reaches where my arm can't, cracks and cranies and does it throughly without any after taste or film to alter the drink."
2,Cleaning was never so easy,My wife always had issues while cleaning my stainless steel thermos that I take to office filled with coffee. The opening is so small that washing it becomes a pain. The other day she was telling me about the OXO good grips bottle brush; she is able to clean my thermos without any worry. The bristles are soft yet firm on the base and side walls that it does not leave any scratch. Even after repeated use the brittles remain firm and have not lost its shape. The handle has a decent grip and despite using with soap does not slip. The length is also pretty convenient for cleaning elongated bottles. It is a must have in any household.
2,Soft and Flexible,I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
2,Great bottle brush!,"I needed a brush to clean the inside of my Takeya water bottle. This brush did the trick. It feels good in your hands, cleans very well, and it's of great quality. If you're looking for a bottle brush, look no further...snap this up at this great price!"
2,Bottle Brush,I needed a bottle brush for my water bottles that I take to work and to the gym. This product is just right. It has the perfect length and the brush bristles aren't to coarse.
2,Hank just can't seem to win,"Hank, the Head of Ranch Security, is troubled by Eddy the Rac. Eddy is the newest addition at the ranch. Hank always seems to end up on the bad end of ""moonlight madness"". Will this cowdog and strange acting racoon ever see eye to eye? This is a very entertaining story; it will make you giggle and laugh out loud."
1,Not the least bit entertaining,"David Harum is an old guy who loves to tell long, drawnout stories about nothing in particular. The author writes Harum's stories in dialect, a pet peeve of mine. It would be endurable if the stories had anything to do with anything, but most of the time they don't. There's even a long, drawn-out story of Harum telling a long, drawn-out story! I'm doubly damned. There's a secondary character of John Lennox. We get a brief glimpse of his story and the cold fish he ends up with, but his main purpose in the book is to be the audience for Harum's tall tales. I don't recommend this book at all."
2,Home Owner,"This was great, hands down the best one I have installed.Seems faster then all the others I had before filling the tank.Was also very easy to install, it was harder getting the old one out for me!Very nice product and even greater price. Five star rateing for sure."
2,"Good Material, Lacking Translations","I picked this up since it had pretty favorable reviews. Having finished it I can say it was worthwhile to buy. There are a lot of good tips and advice for writing stories regardless of genre. I'm not even sure why it's labeled as ""Shojo"" outside of being part of a series since the tips are applicable for all genres. It's divided into short easily-digestible chapters that you can try out once you're done and it does a good job building on ideas each chapter. My only caveat is that the translation isn't very good in places and some phrases come off as too generic or repetitive. While reading it I kept feeling like there was probably more subtle aspects to each lesson that didn't make it through translation."
1,Felt Scatterbrained.,I felt the booked lacked a lot. The art was great but i learned nothing from the book in regards to writing. I was expecting something a bit more descriptive and was disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,"Really, really, boring repetitive low-key techno","On it's own, this record may be (barely) decent, but compared to Gus Gus' other efforts it is surprisingly lame, boring, monotonous, unoriginal, etc. I know it's their earlier work, and perhaps they were ahead of their time--but instead of appreciating their ""roots"" it's much more enjoyable to listen to their more developed recordings. This CD has no standout tracks, save for ""purple"", which was already released on their other records. This CD does not seem like a ""Gus Gus"" CD--it could be anybody making mediocre techno music with a synthesizer and boring samples. Buyers beware, for die-hard fans only..."
1,Not the best!,"Loved the film when it first came out and have seen it many times since. There is only one song on this CD that creates the excitement experienced when you watch the movie, You're The Best, and for me, it was worth getting the CD for just that song."
1,Piece of Junk,"This stapler is not worth a penny. It constantly jams. Every time I reload, it takes about 10 jams and half of the new clip of staples until it starts working. And yes, I am using genuine Arrow T50 staples for reloads. I know this is the only stapler like it on the market, but you would be better off with a hammer and a box of staples. Save your $20"
1,paperweight,"Garbage, utter garbage. I've had every incarnation of Arrow stapler, from the classic to the ""upper end"" models and they ALL FAIL shortly after purchase even with Arrow brand staples."
1,If you buy this staple gun buy a hammer also,"I bought this staple gun because staples are not being made for my 40+ year old Bostitch any longer, and this stapler seems to be one of the few choice around. I am really disappointed. It does not seat the staples like my old Bostitch, so I end up driving most of them home with a hammer. This stapler is poorly designed since the amount of pressure needed to shoot staple does not result in a seated staple. My old Bostitch was easy to push and still seated the staples."
1,Totally useless,Purchased this a few weeks ago to clean tile grout.Bristles bent out of shape after a short time.OXO usually makes good products but not this one.A loser.
2,Use for dishes,"The best brush I've ever had to clean food off dishes and pots before washing. After a year, it still works well and looks pretty good."
2,This book rocks!,"The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.' I am so thankful that I found this book by chance; I'm buying copies for friends already."
1,A complete waste of time,"This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences. 1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it! Get a life women and figure it out on your own."
2,"Good quality, molded plug","The plug is molded, which is great. It is very substantial and well made.Each wire is rated correctly (neutral and 12v for example being a heavier gauge than the turn signal).I would buy again"
2,this is NOT PERFORMED BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE,"all other songs are sung by the familiar artists, but YMCA is NOT PERFORMED BY THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. Some woman I haven't heard of sings it, albeit somewhat satisfactorily."
2,son's movie,"The family enjoys this movie, so much my son got a guinea pig. He named it Darwin. Its a very enjoyable kids movie."
1,If You Hate Your Kids: Smells Worse Than a Dirty Hamster Cage...,"Wait, stop! I know what you are thinking: ""This film is obviously bad, why on Earth did you watch it?""Now, this film could have worked, if the correct approach was taken. Nope, I don't know what that approach would be; but this film took the wrong one. The cheesy jokes, the bad acting, and the ridiculous story all contribute to this film's failure.Sadly, I watched the entire film, and the last few parts were the worst. Giant explosions and a giant robot attack the wise-cracking guinea pigs. But thisscene was actually kind of boring.skip it."
2,LOVED IT,"Yes im a Grandma....but I bought this for me.....I do have GP's as pets as well.....and I can see there personalities as is the case in this fun film......I really enjoy watching it and it brings lots of laughs and so do a couple of my friends enjoy it as well.yes the grandkids will watch it with me, .this is just a fun movie and I cant wait for more sequels to come out.....B.W."
1,Phew...This movie stinks,"Well, on the positive side this movie was clean without too much crude humor. Of course it had the gas passing humor that you find in most films of this genre. Negatively speaking this has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that I have ever seen. It just was lacking something. I never really cared if the rodents suceeded in their mission or not."
1,Bad Oxo Product,"We love OXO products, but this one is not one of them. Shrimps get mangled. Might be good for very large shrimp though, but not for medium ones. My wife found it faster to just use her nails."
1,Don't buy this one!,"The first 2 songs are good indeed, but all the others are super-kitsch, really horrible, over, disgusting! Try to find the right CDs from this master. I had read the other reviews and bought this one, and now I feel like throwing it through the window."
2,Never leaves my side,I tend to over-stuff the front pockets and the flap does not alwaysvelcro close. But I tend to carry too much stuff.The unit is a great utility pouch and holds up well.
2,"Definitely a ""Good Grip""","I have and have used at least 15 other vegetable brushes. All for the most part were decent. The OXO is a step above most but not perfect. The size is great for a small to medium size hand and adequate for a larger hand. The bristles are firm, great for potatoes, carrots, etc. I would recommend a second, softer brush for more delicate fruits and vegetables. Combined with a vegetable wash likeFit Fruit & Vegetable Wash, Soaker/Refill Bottle, 32-Ounce Units (Pack of 3)and you have an excellent 1-2 knockout punch for dirt, pesticides, bacteria, etc. Once you see the difference in just how clean your fruits and veggies are after you utilize your new secret weapons, you wont go back to hand rubbing, guaranteed!"
2,Great for even bigger hands,"Once my family started eating a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes I found it necessary to purchase a good scrub brush as we like to leave the skin on.This is great, really cleans the potatoes and other root vegetables really well. Easy to clean and easy to use even for someone with XL hands like myself.OXO has yet to disappoint me."
2,easy to grasp vegetable brush,"large size of brush, makes it very easy to hold while cleaning vegetables. bristles are not too stiff, nor too soft."
2,Nice Brush,"This brush is not your basic veggie brush. It fits nicely in my hands and it's rubberized grip is fantastic and non slip. The bristles are softer than many I have used, yet stiff enough to clean the biggest potatos and carrots. Sometimes with my other veggie brush my hand would get cramped. Your probably wondering... ""How many veggies must that guy scrub if his hand gets cramped?"" Well, I scrub lots of veggies- I am a professional scrubber. Anyway, this brush sure gets those vegetables clean."
2,I am glad i made this purchase.,"Probably the luckiest dollars i have used to purchase this vegetable brush. It's worth every penny. Just buy it, you won't regret it. I used some other vegetable brushes they are not even worth comparing to OXO quality."
2,"GOod, but sometimes cheesy","In each track of this album, there's a different band formation, composed of Gary's guest musicians like Glenn Hughes, Neil Carter & Phil Lynott. It contains big sucess of his career, like ""Out in the Fields"" and ""Military Man"". It's an irregular record, however, and it's not on of his best. THe subsequent ""Wild Frontier"" is more coherent."
1,Horrible,Used this cutting board for 8 days before it warped. Rolls all over the cabinet now.Don't buy......get a plastic board or the cutting sheets that sell for about $1.00
2,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, ""What is truth?"" and ""What/who is God?"" and ""Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?""There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once."
1,Terrible,"An experiment:1. Listen to ""Splendor Solis"", ""Edges of Twilight"", ""Alhambra"", and ""Transmission"".2. Next, listen to ""Triptych"", ""Interzone Mantras"", and ""Seven Circles"".3. Which group of albums churns your stomach raw???Something between Transmission and Triptych occurred that radically altered the Tea Party's musical vision, but I can't begin to imagine. Nonetheless, The Tea Party is no longer a band I musically respect. ""The Seven Circles"" embodies a form of music that I find repugnant. The party is indeed over.This album is TERRIBLE."
2,Even better on Vinyl,"I just scored Jean-Luc Ponty's Enigmatic Ocean LP in mint condition, on vinyl, through Ebay for $6.00. Totally made my day. What a great album."
1,terrible writing style and unbelievable story,"This author doesn't understand what a sentence is and how to complete one. Half of pages are filled with one 'sentence' making it incredibly difficult to follow the unnecessarily long, winded descriptions of menial objects and detail. Also, the whole idea of a post-American society dominated by a repressive Christian group is totally ludicrous and I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the story throughout many points.1 star: one of the worst books I've ever read."
1,Tripe,"I wouldnt read this intolerant tripe if it demonized the far left, or Muslims or the Tooth Fairy.Its one long poorly conceived political statement. Im sorry I even picked this up. Hate and intolerance for differing political viewpoints make bad reading no matter what side of the spectrum the author lies."
1,Steaming pile of chick book,She's a good writer. Maybe it's the company she keeps. Anyone who likens this to 1984 or Brave New World is a twit. That's one of the tests you can keep in your toolkit.
1,"Dull, far fetched",A book based on thought process should somewhat resemble what one is actually like.
1,"I really found this book disgusting, confusing, and morbid.","I had to read this book for english class at school. I reallydidn't like it. I found it confusing how offred went back and forthfrom present time to her old life. It was disgusting how she discribed the ritual for her to get pregnant. What kind of author would actually write about beig a handmaid, especially if it's not true? I heard there's a movie that's based on the book, and they end different. Thank goodness the commander doesn't die in the book like the movie, that would have made me hate this book more. I can't believe people would actually enjoy this book. I think your ratin was rather high, seeing as it's kind of a strange topic."
1,"dull,but futuristic",well all i have to say about this book is that to me it sucked. no matter how futuristic it got or how good it attempted to get it just couldn't hold my interest. the historical notes did alot for me but it still didn't make me remember this book. definitly not one of my favorites. i wouldn't ever read this book again i can tell u that for a fact. jacki.a
1,This book is horrible...,"Those of you who like Atwood will enjoy this book,... I guess... it's very futuristic and deals with some scary subjects, but flat out, it's boring...if you have to read it, I suggest Cliff Notes!"
1,The Handmaid's Tale,My Book Club assigned this book. I never would have chose it on my own. And I certainly never would have finished it had I not been obligated to do so before my next club meeting.
1,handmaid's tale-really worth reading?,"In my opinion ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood is a rather annoying lecture if you are not interested in the issue of dystopias and totalitarian states.Lenghty and very detailed descriptions of the everyday life of the protagonist might force the bravest readers to surrender.The basic idea, however,is well chosen and the topic offers a lot of potential to create a disturbing and even horrific vision of the future. Atwood delivers with her novel a new aspect in the various dystopias of the 20th century: the tyranny of a fundamental christian sect.Considering all these aspects one could remark that the artistic realization leaves a lot to be desired.But the final question,if the handmaid's tale is really worth reading is difficult to answer.If you are interested in becoming acquainted with dystopian novels you will be more content with one of the classic dystopias, such as Orwell's ""1984"" or Huxley's ""Brave New World""."
2,good,"I read this book because it was on the 100 books to read before you die, and it didn't disappoint. New twist to a common theme- governments out of control."
2,Ominous story of a future world,Atwood has masterfully written a tale of future world in which women are enslaved by zealots of a new world order. Her haunting epilogue of anthropologists clinically analyzing the remains of that world gives a somber tone to the end of the volume. I read this book in 1988 and again in 2013. It stands as a classic.
2,Haunting,"I suspect that this book was a chilling read when it was published in the 1980's, but it is especially disturbing in 2008. The threats Atwood identified then-- religious fundamentalism, an environmental apocalypse, spying and terror committed by governments, increasing control over women's bodies-- seem even more pertinent today. Atwood's humor keeps the book from ever becoming too bleak."
2,Personal Freedoms,"I think what Margaret Atwood's, The Handmaid's Tale is a foreshadowing to our own futures. In this novel all peronal freedoms are taken from the main character and all the remaining people. I think this is a good representation of what could happen when people stopped participating in the social/political happenings around them. Everyone must make sure that even the smallest freedoms being taken away from them must not be overlooked. We must keep our eyes open and stay active in our surroundings and decisions regarding our lives."
2,A great book. Anyone willing to be shocked should read it.,"What an excellent book. By following Offred's daily routine we learn about a frightening new society, one where a religious faction has taken control of the government and subjugated all who do not agree with their doctrines. This story gives rise to disturbing thoughts about what could happen if a zealous religious group did gain control of the government. The beginning is a bit slow, which is necessary to introduce you into the monotony of Offred's daily life. The novel picks up soon enough, to the point where I read the last half of the book in one sitting. All in all, an excellent book. I would recommend it to almost anyone."
1,A confused feminist view of the future,"Only a confused and paranoid feminist could come up with such an story. This book (set in the not too distant future) is actually nothing more than an attack on conservative Christian values. The idea that right wing conservatives would turn all females into slaves if given the chance is absurd. I will give Atwood credit for creativity. However, A Handmaid's Tale is only worth reading if you actually enjoy ridiculous science fiction."
1,a traumatizing experience,"maybe she's a popular and celebrated author of our culture, but I can't go with the popular view on this one. There is no good reason to read this book. It is just another way to get off for the men who believe this way of life would be great for them and want to keep things as conservative as they can already, and it is just another way for women to get traumatized by reading this. I was actually traumatized by this book. Women know the problems with society, and this book offers nothing helpful; it simply adds to the pain. If you are an adult, feel free to damage your soul some more by exposing yourself to more pain and violence. Under no circumstances should a minor read this book. I am a progressive liberal, by the way. But I also know how to see the truth and think for myself."
2,Changed my life,"I first read this book as a teen after it was named one of the year's best by Time. I was a fan of dystopian fiction, but this was something else. Atwood creates a future that seemed real and familiar and possible, and normal, everyday female characters I could identify with, even in 1987. It changed my life and I credit it with my feminism and healthy distrust of organized religion and government. I've read it many times since, and I'm always surprised at how much closer to this reality we're getting, rather than farther away."
1,Learn Biblical Hebrew 2nd Edition by John Dobson - not useful for me,"I was particularly interested in the CD, but found it extremely disappointing. The readers sounded bored and very American. There was no ""teaching"" attached to the CD, just reading words and paragraphs in uninspired voices.The cover claims one could start reading meaningful verses after just 2 hours. After 2 hours I was still struggeling to decipher the differences in the Hebrew letters.If someone wants a reference book to the language, this works fine. But it has a weakness in its teaching sequence. A lot of steps are missing."
1,La Mer,OK way to try product with low $ price. Would not buy regular size. Use the La Mer cream all the time but this concentrate is not worth the $$$.
2,Perfect for classroom collections!,"If you teach a young age students love this product for when you read ""Where the Wild Things Are"" I also recommend acquiring the Wild Thing Plush toys to accompany it."
1,Ruined my HD,"This product does not come with any sort of instructions, but I followed the photo on the cover of the box plugging in my SATA HD. The minute I plugged in the power cord, I smelled something burning and saw smoke coming out. Immediately unplugged the power cord, but the HD is gone."
1,Beware of who you order this through...,"I ordered this from a company called HDE. They did not send me the Cables Unlimited product, instead they sent me a generic product that they advertise for less than half the cost of this item.My review is rated solely on the company HDE sending the wrong product."
2,Good Product,I am very convinced this product is very well made.I like everything about.I will tell my friends about it.Good job.
1,A slasher with gusto,"Can you believe this movie is Francis Ford Coppola, and produced by Roger Corman? Nether can the viewer. I am not sure how it made it to film. However it has collector value.Dementia 13 is not a bad movie; it is a little dark in more ways than one. The just is nothing significant about it other than a few hacker scenes.We find our self in a Castle with a murderer who is bumping every one off. The question is ""who done it?""Was it Lizzie Borden or Jeffery Dalmer?Maybe it was mommy?Or the mad doctor?Who knows?This movie makes a good addition to slasher movies and it is not as mindless as most.Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)"
2,Remove yer brain... it's Laymon!,"When I see a book on the shelf by Laymon, whether it be new orused, I feel like a gunfighter in a spaghetti western... I can herethe theme for ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""... In my mind, that best describes the books of Richard Laymon... I consider ""One Rainy Night"" to be one of the ""good"". The story goes from 0 to 60 from page one and somehow, keeps going full bore for 416 pages! Doesn't seem that long, but it is... Blood and guts, sex and rape, it's all here in typical Laymon fashion... a B-novel that's a definite no- brainer! And despite it's flaws (weak characters, poor dialogue...), it's perversely enjoyable! Though I do agree with the reviewer who recommended ""The Fog"" by James Herbert, it truly is a classic!"
1,Very Contrived,"As an avid reader of horror fiction, I looked forward to reading this author's material for the first time. I was quite disappointed.Yes, it is a page-turner, but a very shallow page turner. I found myself skimming as I hit the middle of it...and once I begin skimming, that's the death of a novel to me.The characters have absolutely no depth. Their various motivations make little sense. Why would a police detective run an obstacle course of insane murderers to find a woman he knew only a few days...risking the lives of people under his protection? Why were three teenaged boys so bad to the bone? So many more inconsistencies and unexplored questions.I seriously doubt I'll pick up another of his books."
2,Looking forward to CURSED,"Reading SCREAM seven years after the initial impact of the film--and in movie terms seven years is definitely a whole generation later--I wonder if it would be a success if Williamson wrote the same material today. Some of it is very clever, and the references to pop culture still work, but more might have been made of the human and emotional back stories of the main characters. Neve Campbell's character, for example, doesn't have the emotional resonance years later that (to take up a similar example in a different film genre) Molly Ringwald displayed in her movies for John Hughes.I look forward to CURSED, the new collaboration between Kevin Williamson and Wes Crave, though the rumors of the re-shoots and re-takes, actors being fired, etc., and dissatisfied test audiences, make one wonder if it won't be more like KILLING MRS TINGLE than SCREAM. Still, there's always hope."
1,Was he really a member of the Eagles...,"Together with the other guys in Eagles, Don Henley assured his immortal place in rock history. I wonder - how can a man who was a part of something so great as the Eagles release such a [bad] bunch of songs? I just don't get it! I owned this album for many years but when it was time to ""weed out"" my cd collection I decided that this one have to go. But before I sold it, I wanted to record the best songs from it, but I must admit that I couldn't find a single song I really like. So, now it's gone, and I have not missed it for even a split second!"
1,Not a DVD Audio,"Beware,This is not a DVD-A, it is a 5.1 DTS recording, at 44.1/16. It is not a hi-def/hi-res recording. It's basically a surround-CD. Unfortunately, Amazon does not seem to have a cubby for it, so they list it under DVD Audio."
2,Great book on home architecture,This book offers a wide range of home styles from around the globe in almost 1000 pages (999 to be exact). With more pictures than text this is definitely eye candy for anyone who loves residential architecture. A+
2,Replacing a favorite,"My mother bought this spatula for me 7 years ago, an like the one star-er I thought this thing is hokey, thin and cheap.... until I got to know it. This spatula is the very best tool in my kitchen along with myFox Run Stainless Steel Magic Whiskreally absolute favorites.I just purchased three of these spatulas because my roommate killed my original.I highly recommend this small wonderful addition to the kitchen"
2,Just love this band,"I just love this band. Lynott's melodic and sensible vocals, the incredibly duo of guitarists Robertson and Gorham, the efficient and imaginative drumming of Downey.Johnny The Fox is one of their best albums. It flows effortlessly."
1,"Good quality, but...","oh, the sound! It's just a high pitch that hurts my ears. I ended up giving it away to my coworker."
1,the sound was not great,"the sound was not too nice, I am not into music so I did not know what to expect.. however I do suggest the trio chime is sounds very pretty I might say. this solo one is not a good purchase.."
2,Good value,"I originally bought this strainer to make baby food for my son, but I use it all the time for things that are smaller and don't necessitate a large colander. It is very sturdy and fits across one side of my double sink, leaving my hands free. It cleans in the dishwasher. Good product at a reasonable price."
2,Best yet,I actually bought this CD a couple of years ago as an import. It is easily the best work of Kotzen's to date. Quite a range of sounds from sweet and melodic to pure rock and roll in the form of The Stones or Black Crows. As always superb guitar work and vocals.
2,The real reason there are so many bad reviews here is. . .,"due to a coordinated effort by a right wing web site that hates Oliver Stone and anybody else that doesn't share its ideological slant. They encouraged their members to write poor reviews to convince you that this movies is not worth your time. They are angry that Hollywood is able to make a movie about many aspects of Bush's life that were true, but which the corporate owned media didn't allow discussion of. So if thats who you are too, take their advice because you will hate this movie. The other 70% of the country should see the movie and judge for themselves."
1,Stone goes easy...,"but even that is cutting. You watch and say ""He was elected twice!"" What will future generations say?"
2,Surprisingly current,While this book was written almost a century ago it is surprisingly current with the economic situation we are presently in.
1,Awful....Terrible....Very poorly Acted,"From the casting to the sets, to the acting and beyond; this movie is really, really, really bad. Do not under any circumstance waste your time with this."
1,Not what you see,I bought this swaybar bushing kit for the front of my 07 FX2.All you get is the bushing for the front swaybar to frame.No greasable brackets.or endlinks.I guess I didnt read good enough.
1,Mormon and Pychic based program,"I was shocked to find out that this program is filled with Mormon theology. It is based on such theories as Suggestology, which is listed under Pychic studies in Amazon search. This is just not a program that I think any child or adult should expose themselves to.Here is a list of the other theories this method is based on and where the information can be found:Suggestopedy by LoranovTotal Physical Response by AsherSilent Way by GattengoComprehension Approach by Krashen*As described in Dr. Blair's book Innovative Approaches to Language Teaching."
2,NICE LITTLE BOOK WITH SOME AMAZING RECIPES,"I purchased this book to use with the Tortilla pan set and it has some really amazing recipes, at least I would not have thought of, like deserts and soups. I only gave it a four, because I like photos and nutritional info in recipe books. That said, even if you don't purchase the pans, this is an inexpensive little recipe book to have handy."
2,Tortilla binge,"This is a great little book with lots of neat ideas. The recipes are simple and use common ingredients. I used mine as a bunco prize with a jar of homemade salsa, a jar of conqueso, and a package of chips."
1,not the best,"This bottle opener is too thin and doesn't work really good. sorry, but for the price what do you expect"
1,Mind corrupting Religious Indoctrination,"-RE: (Book) ""Sound Health, Sound Wealth"" By Luanne Oakes-Ms. Oakes says: ""As we increasinglymaster our perceptions, beliefs, and thought/feeling patterns, wemagnetically attract that which we most desire."" -- Luanne Oakes=========================================I say: Zombie-robots are incapable of ""mastering"" themselves!Or, ""Perceptions, beliefs, and thought/feeling patterns"".I say: All 'that' is 'reserved' for the 'rational' few among us.=========================================""Luanne Oakes"" system, and style of expressing many of her mindcontrolling assertions and MAZE-like deflections from 'rational-reality',remind me of ""Deepak Chupra's"" writing; serving a similar purpose namely,to mandate 'blind faith' in a farce as the absolute only way to besuccessful at anything!-"
2,Sound advice for energictically healing yourself,One of THE BEST books I've read on sound and energetic healing.... and I have a HUGE library of integrative healing books! I enjoy the CD often... especially in the evening.
1,Sound Health Sound Wealth,"This book is another self-help book. I enjoyed the book HOWEVER, IT LOST SOME CREDIBILITY WHEN I read the last sentenced, in the first paragraph of page 171 of Chapter Six, The Principle of Sound and Light. It reads:""In the physical world of matter, Sound precedes Light, as we know from hearing the thunder before we see the lightning in a storm. *****Maybe, I am confused, but, I see lightning FIRST and start the ONE ONE THOUSAND count down to hear the thunder and determine how far away the storm is."
2,Colunbia Vest,"Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas. Beautiful red shade, and fits extremely well. He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition."
1,Garbage,"I couldn't agree more with the other negative reviews on this site. The depressions for the cubes are too small, resulting in the need to fill the trays to the top to get decent-sized cubes, and when you do so, the water runs everywhere and the lid freezes to the tray, making the tray frustratingly difficult to open. These trays are actually less functional and harder to use than the cheap plastic ones you can buy everywhere for under a dollar."
1,Not for me,I bought this as a way to avoid freezer burn on my ice cubes..didn't work out very well for me. Still had freezer burn getting in and sliding the top on and off when filled with water was difficult and messy.I bought the tupperware covered trays at the same time as I bought these and I love them.
1,BE CAREFUL!!,These seem like a GREAT idea but they do not work! Water spills all over. These should of never made it through OXO product development!
2,works but don't overfill,These trays are very neat & work as designed for ice. We got them for baby food & found out quickly not to overfill them or the lid is nearly impossible to get off. I like that you can pop out just the number of ice cubes you need.
2,Great Radio Contacts,"As an indie musician, I am always trying to get my music heard. I need some radio station contacts and the names of any record stores that would sell my CD. This directory was just what I needed. So far I have been in contact with over 25 radio stations and I am sure there will be plenty more in the near future!"
2,Great!,Super BooK! I found here everything I needed!!! Everything! Even the most unknown radio stations!I even found a record store! It doesn't matter where you live because it has everything!
1,What is on this turtle's head?,"This is a perfectly acceptable baby toy, I guess -- my daughter liked it when she was about six months old and teething -- but it has a penis on its head. I know it's supposed to be a snorkel, but it looks like exactly one thing, and trust me, everybody who sees the toy will notice it immediately. All of the Baby Einstein turtle toys have the same stupid snorkel thing -- our crib mobile has the same problem.I'm not a prude but this is a pretty dumb design for a baby toy. I sure wouldn't buy this as a gift."
2,A little known treasure....,"This is an album that I had originally discovered in the late 80's as a young child, and a fairly new Reba fan. What's nice about this album is that it is full of unreleased material that is just precious. If you want to hear a gentle, relaxed side of Reba McEntire, then ""Reba Nell McEntire"" is a must have album."
1,the worst movie ever [.],"Before I get started I want to make one thing clear. This is not a Jackie Chan movie! Jackie only comes in for a few scenes.And when he does appear he has a huge clump of hair on the side of his face! Dont get this movie confused with Jackie's box office smash Rumble In The Bronx. This movie is A.K.A. Police Women,and Young Tiger. So watch out! If you are looking for a Jackie Chan movie don't waste your money![.] If you are looking for a great Kung-Fu movie try somewhere else!"
2,Superb technique,"Many of the reviews complain about Ewing's vocality, but this is exactly what makes the performance so blood-chilling perfect. Rather than just blasting out all the notes as you average battle-axe soprano would, Ewing uses the German ""sing-speak"" technique that became so briefly popular in the 20th century among composers of dissonance. Much of her banter is spoken in melody with dramatic inflection, although to the musical notes, and is amazingly effective in portraying a fixated, spoiled, and nasty teeny-bopper. She has perfected operatic creepiness as it was intended for this work."
1,Motor was made in China!!!!,The motor was made in China. The first motor the gear did not mate up. It made a loud grinding sound. I returned it and the second motor worked OK
1,Defective Latch won't hold the motor to the bucket,I bought this and the first time I put it together the latch that secures the motor came right off. So I returned it and Amazon was kind enough to immediately send me a replacement. The replacement lasted a little longer. I was at least able to secure the motor and begin to use it when once again the latch came off and I had no way of securing the motor to the bucket. I'm returning it for a refund this time and shopping for a different freezer.
2,Works great!! If only...,"... it wasn't so noisy!Actually, to be fair its probably worth 5 stars. The ice cream is done quickly, turns out great, and the whole thing cleans up just fine. This is the first ice cream maker I've ever bought, plus the motor is pretty noisy, so I figured I'd leave alittle room for a higher rating.Have used it twice. Didn't even remember the directions, and the ice cream still turned out fantastic."
1,Motor jammed after 2 minutes,Unfortunately I never got a chance to test this machine because the motor jammed up after only 2 minutes. I had barely started putting ice into it. I had guests coming over so was forced to go buy a cheap maker for the party. I am ordering a replacement that I hope will actually work.
1,Motor loud and quit working,"Just after my warranty expired, the motor quit working. I was thinking that spending this much for an ice cream freezer would mean it would last a long time. Not so! Everything is in good condition except the motor. Very dissatisfied"
2,A Moving Tribute & A Must Read,"Jere Longman took faces that we saw on television during montages of photos and made them living, breathing valuable people. They were mothers, fathers, sons and daughters... they represented the best of America and all of them more than met the challenge of the four men who hijacked that plane. After reading the book, I need not watch the endless tributes that TV will offer on the anniversary of 9/11. Mr. Longman has honored the memory of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 with a heartfelt tome."
2,Love this show,"Love the characters and, of course, the main star is Oahu itself in all its glory. Heaven on earth from the Mountains to the Sea!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Good Cast, Poor Writing, Defies Logic Then Tried to Get Political","This was a show I really wanted to succeed since I really liked the cast but poor writing, really impossible situations that were never explained and then the Pro-Gun Control rant (which served no purpose for the show) just ended it for me. When you allow poor writers to inject their political views into a script for no reason other than letting them air their political tendencies I give up! Maybe they should bring back Moonlight since this show may survive this season but in the long run it is gone."

1,What everyone says is true!,"We have a new home with this model installed and now 6 months later and after 2 nights of false alarms awaking us first at 3AM and then again later, these units are now removed. We examined them (clean and no dust), changed batteries and found nothing wrong...just another night of disconcerting awakening. The builder did not leave us a manuel and neither can we find one online. I'm writing this at 2:30 AM after having found these very helpful reviews...thank you!...I can go back to bed without fear except minus detectors until we purchase new ones. Do not purchase this model!"
1,Goes off for no reason,"Piece of junk. It goes off for no reason, but only in the middle of the night."
1,Yet another false alarm review,"So, here I am at 03:34 AM writing a review for a smoke detector. Why you may ask, well if you have read other reviews on this product you will realize that it is because a false alarm has awoken me for the second night in a row. The first night we thought it was a battery issue but even after changing it continues to chirp. This second we just unplugged it and will be getting a new one tomorrow as this is ridiculous.Please, if you are even remotely considering this model, do you self a favor and get something else. Your family may not thank you, but at least they wont be plotting to kill you after a second night of false alarms in a row."
1,mad chirping,"this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this. we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system. when the chirping started about several months ago we didn't have a clue (and still don't) on how to stop it. there was no manual or instruction left. its electric and I don't know how to get to the battery. i can't believe they put these smoke alarms in new houses without a manual. after viewing all the negative reviews and seeing that the product is discontinued, we will probably have to replace all of smoke alarms in our house. there's one in every room. how can a company provide a product with no instrutions to service it."
1,Thank Goodness I'm not alone in this!,"Good to know this is a problem with others as well! My husband and I were awakened a week ago to the alarms all going off @ 3 AM. We never could figure out what happened and thought maybe it was a power surge. Then last night, at the same time, it occurred again. Only this time, an hour later it again went off and then again another 10 minutes later. Our solution: temporarily turn off the suckers @ the electrial box AND remove the batteries. We air-blasted and shook the one that was the culprit and a TINY spider dropped out. It was miniscule!! We have since cleaned ALL of the detectors AND once again replaced the batteries. Based on the other descriptions I am NOT holding out hope. It is worth my sanity to replace them all. I hope the manufacturer reads all of these reviews!!!!"
2,"Tom Jones ""Love Is On The Radio""","Many years ago, probably over thirty, I was hearing selections on the radio from this album, very appropriate title. I liked what I heard & later tried to get it on audio cassette, no CD's then, but it had been taken off the market. I had not thought any more about it until browsing Amazon a couple of years ago & had no hesitation in ordering it when I saw it available. Anyone who likes Tom Jones would love this album, I like every song that is on it."
2,perfect and imperfect sagas,this is a good season and leads up to the cell gamessome good fights in this set that make it really coolthis is a must have
1,far too basic,"Thsi volume is far too basic to be of much use beyond a first year Bible college class. For the seminary student or pastor looking for a good reference tool, there are much better New Testament introductions and surveys available. This added nothing to my study of the New Testament."
2,My favorite all time jazz album.,"Best jazz album ever. If you can keep still, listening to this one, you have no music in your soul. Super solos by some of the best in the business.Arranged by Lalo Shiffrin.I've been collecting jazz albums for over 50 years."
1,quit working,this is one of the few items I have ever has to return. The fan stopped working just after two days. I did get a prompt refund from amazon.
1,worst fan ever,I purchased a Lasko fan and it only worked for 1 year. I cannot turn the knob to start the fan. The company has ignored my requests to replace the fan. This is a warning not to buy a Lasko fan.
1,Bad business,"The fan pictured above is not the fan the company sends out. They send out a different, inferior model. Lasko did not respond to emails regarding the problem. Dishonest advertising. Buyer beware!"
1,DOA,"Almost bought this from Amazon, but instead got it from Home Depot, and avoided the shipping. Unfortunately this fan was dead on arrival. I tried different outlets and different speed setting, but the fan just did nothing. I will try to return for an exchange. I have a feeling this is a common issue with these."
2,Good power and not too quiet.,"This fan is doing an excellent job of pulling in the cooler morning air into my house down here in hot Florida.It has much more power than the similarly priced and smaller fans that I have.Also, the adverising makes the claim that it's whisper quiet; Fortunately, that's not accurate. There is a strong smooth white noise that drowns out most of the extraneous and annoying noise in the house and outside.Honeywell used to make fans with this much power that were smaller and could be tilted and that costs around $15.00. Those were 5 star fans. The Lasko 3733 is a solid 4 star fan."
1,Cheap but not worth it.,"First day I had the fan, I turned it on, walked away and two minutes later it fell over and one of the blade's broke right off. I thought the fan had exploded! The air flow was ok, but it needs to be securely attached to something or it will fall over."
2,Required reading,"If society is to ever evolve and embrace an ethic of compassion toward humans and animals, it will only happen when we confront the ideas presented in this book. Reading Eternal Treblinka is not always a pleasant experience, but it is, nonetheless, a vital one. This book should be required reading in every secondary school in the country."
2,Fascinating look at 20th Century America,"In America Reborn, British writer Martin Walker assumes the unique perspective of examining quintessentially ""American"" attributes through retrospectives of twenty-six individuals. For anyone with an interest in American history, this book provides clear and interesting essays that reach from the depths of American politics (FDR and an exceptionally harsh view of Nixon), American economics (Alan Greenspan), and American international intrigue (Richard Bissell and George Marshall) to the heights of American leisure activities (Duke Ellington, Katharine Hepburn, and Walt Disney). The approximately fifteen page, tidy chapters devoted to each individual fly by with interesting tidbits of historical information and clear explanation. This British writer has provided an introspective and fascinating look into America and its personality, matching up attributes to individuals that would be, in most cases, proud to claim them."
1,Not compatable with Mac,"I bought the Memorex cd/dvd label maker kit and the jewel case inserts and a box of 50 jewel cases today.CAN NOT DOWNLOAD MEMOREX SOFTWARE ON A MAC!!Then I thought, well at least i can still use the Memorex Jewel Cases.I opened the package and 5 or 6 were already broken.I feel so ripped off.Now I have to go return them tomorrow and I lost a lot of time and money.Memorex sucks!"
1,Software not compatible with Vista,"I was more than excited to get started stomping out CD/DVD labels, as I had used this software on my old XP machine (and, while awkward to use, it worked great). However, while it seemed to install fine in Vista, nothing would print. The calibration page actually made a piece of paper feed through, but nothing printed on it. Any other attempts would show a brief flash of something sent to the print spooler, but nothing else. I tried XP compatibility mode, running as administrator... nothing. Printing from other applications works just fine, so it's not my printer or my driver. I ended up using bundled software that came with my CD burner. But hey, the labels themselves are great, and the little plastic stompy-thing is wonderful to perfectly apply the labels every time. If you're purchasing it simply for the physical product, it's more than worth your money."
2,label maker for cd's,"This is a great product! It's easy to use, and it makes the cd's, dvd's look like professional items, instead of just being scribbled on."
1,By HAND ONLY,Don't bother with this cheaply made gadget. It is so much easier and so much more accurate and so much faster to apply your CD labels by hand. Trust me.
1,Prints way off the mark,After hours of screwing around there is now way to print these labels on center. Finally I had to cut 1/2 inch off the top of the label page to get it somewhat close. You have 2 choices buy this or buy a bullet and rent a gun...you'll need it.
1,"The book fails in its primary function, as a reference work.","I opened this book with some anticipation and was immediately let down. Misspelling and mistakes dog almost every page. Did you know that Crassus died in both 55 and 53BC? Gives some meaning to Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' that ""cowards die many times before their deaths."" It struck me as a book of easy compilations from, at most, secondary sources. I would prefer the more expensive, more intellectual and more satisfying Cambridge Dictionary of the Ancient World"
2,A Good Reference,"This encyclopedia is a comprehensive reference of Ancient Rome. Through the years it has been very helpful in finding information about lesser-known Romans. In addition to being alphabetical, it includes an extensive index, a glossary of titles, black and white drawings and several genealogical charts of the families that ruled the Roman Empire.Based on my good experiences with this book, I have also bought Bunson's Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages.I do not understand what the other ""reader"" is referring to. According to the encyclopedia, Crassus died in 53 BC and the battle of Carrhae took place in 53 BC, too. I can not find any reference to 55 BC at all!"
1,Item Pictured is not what is Shipped,"I ordered 3 of these to replace 2 that I've had for nearly 15yrs. What I received were particularly cheaply made - poor effort knockoffs of the original 'CornerSpray' that is pictured.The product shipped is not labeled in any way, nor does it appear to be capable of spraying in a square pattern for right angle corners either. Particularly lightweight unlike the originals, cheaply painted & not powder coated, plus the typical last only 1-2yrs quality plastic couplers.No Star rating.Ace Hardware can do much better than this.Returning tomorrow.5/19/11 Update. Fast response to my request to return, but it cost $12 shipping to return, plus the original $9 shipping when ordered.This all could have been avoided with some truth in advertising that consists on accurate picture of the actual product carried plus a more accurate description of this predictable 'Made in China' product."
2,Powerful message sneaks up on you,"I started reading this book and liked how straightforward and easy it seemed to identify my soft addictions and take steps to change them. As I continued reading and thinking about the book, I became more and more aware of soft addictions -- mine, and those of the people around me. As I continued to work through the book, I felt like a veil was lifted, and I could see what I was really hungry for, and see my friends, coworkers, even people on the street in a new light. We're all walking around hungry all the time, for connection, comfort, love, attention, and we have the opportunity in every moment to get our hungers met, if we are willing to risk it! For example, since reading the book, I've realized how much time I spend surfing the net because I'm feeling lonely, and I've really connected with my coworkers more. I'm more productive AND more satisfied!"
2,A sweet read,"Picking up this book and reading any page has been helpful for me to connect with myself and to other people. I have noticed my mood becoming lighter from reading it. I love the message, especially since I work inthe substance abuse field - everything we do to cover up our feelings that prevents us from being with ourselves can be seen as an addiction. And it is the human condition - not just hard drugs or alcohol are addictions. I think the sooner that we see this, the sooner we can feel less ashamed and be able to ""come clean"" about the crazy stuff we do.This book has really helped me in my personal life and as an addictions counselor in terms of having more love and compassion and purpose in my life."
1,There Must Be More ...,"Look at the cover photo. Have I said enough? This book is mindless drivel. I feel sorry for anyone who has actually read this insincere, unimportant, uninformed ""book"". We're not laughing with you, we're laughing at you."
1,No no no!,"I think Malcolm X was the strongest and the most beautiful character stepped foot on US soil. So this movie by no means represent him or whatsoever (although it has his name on the Title). I think what makes this movie especially -poor- is the ""concerns"" of the director to give a message against Islam... If you are a muslim, and a black... this movie will make your stomach sick.However the film music is goodI hope one day Black Americans really appreciate this wonderful man. Peace."
1,What was the Modern Library thinking?,The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first. Butler's pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters.
1,Better Than Bounty Huntrees,"I wasn't surprised to see that this movie was not as good as it looked. To top it off, Drew Berrymore starred in it and this was the most disappointing thing. I expected her to do better. She is such a beutiful and talented actress and to see her waste her time off this mess is a shame. But I do admit, it is much better than the first one, and I can't blame Drew Berrymore much because the story line sucks. I am so disappointed in the Bounty Huntress films and I am glad than I only spent a few dollars on them."
2,This book is an excellent research resource.,"After researching for years and looking desperately for a good resource on Women in the Celtic times, this book was an amazing find. I was thrilled by the information I found here. I learned things about Celtic Women that I had never imagined could be true. I know that I will be using this book for many years to come."
2,Very good,It's the first time I got a good manual opener.My wife love it. I would like to recommend it to everyone
2,OXO Steel Can Opener,Works great. It is difficult to find a hand held can opener that works without struggleing to open the cans you are trying to get into. This one does the trick.
1,Not quite up to OXO standards,"I wanted to wait to give this some usage before reviewing. Now that we have used it for six months, we have ordered a replacement. It works well, but now has a nice crop of rust. When it comes to can openers and being around industrial openers for decades, I was surprised by how quickly this one rusted. When washed, we hand dry them, so there is a design element that allows this to retain some moisture in the cutting mechanism. Sadly, there is no way to save it."
1,About Year Rusted,"Oddly enough it rusts in only two places. One place you can scrub off the rust with a brush. However, it also rusts in place where the little sharp wheel is connected. There is a small hole (you can see it in the picture) and it's gotten so bad in there that it's about to rust through. I gave it two stars because it is extremely functional and easy to use. But I can't for the life of me understand why they would design this so that the reverse side of the cutting wheel is exposed inside a small hole?"
1,"When it worked, it worked well, but...","When my old Zyliss gave up the ghost I looked about for a replacement. I have other OXO products and am pleased with them, so I gave this a flyer. On the plus side, it's sturdy and very easy to operate. However, I found that most of the time, about four cans out of five, it wouldn't cut the lid completely off. I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one."
2,"Works great, and comfortable.","It's comfortable to use, appears well-built, and opens cans.As it is a can-opener, what more could you want?Highly reccomended- yes, it's a uni-tasker, but it's inexpensive and small."
1,Terrible! Always leaves sharp edges.,"When I ordered this from Amazon, I, immediately, threw away the packaging. It is an OXO product, what could go wrong! ALWAYS leaves sharp edges on the inside of the can!. Since I threw away the packaging, I cannot return it to Amazon. I emailed OXO from their website, 2 weeks ago, as to whether I could exchange it for another of this type. NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM OXO CUSTOMER SERVICE. Now, I am leery of buying OXO products as not even the company will back up the product with a response to an email. This has nothing to do with Amazon from where I will continue to purchase. Go Amazon!"
2,Best can opener ever!,The title of my review says it all: this is the best can opener ever. Each turn is like a little slice of heaven. I don't really know what else to say about it other than it does its job amazingly and I love it.
2,The best!,This is the best can opener I've ever used! I've had mine for at least 5 years and it still works as well as the first day. I put it in the dishwasher regularly so I know that it's always clean and germ-free. I also bought one for my mom and for both of my sons.
2,good but not special,"I have used swing-a-way brand openers for 30 years and they haven't changed a bit. This product is similar but slightly better, I think because of sharper blades. Like many oxo products it is overpriced but if you forget that you will like it for a long whileOne off for price"
1,Bad choice of setting,"I am from South Bend too and this author can go to hell on a hopscotch pad.Who doe s/ he think he is writing about a nice town that way. Funny thing is I bet h/she could not even point out South Bend on a map. This story is so unrealistic. Both of my brothers attended Wayland Academy (private prep school in WI) and both went to Harvard.. YES, South Bend does produce smart children from wealthy families. Ever hear of Studebaker, Curtis? Also, the writing is average. Try again."
2,The High Shool book,"For me, I went to a privite school my whole life and this year '06 my friend decided to go to boarding school so she picked up this book and read it in a day (she is not a very fast or aved reader)and recommened it. Only this summer did I read it. I thought it was an AMAZING book. This book I think tells the truth about the high school life and is not just another book where the author is trying to figure out what the teenager is like. This book tells of the confusion of cruchs and high school and being an outcast. I think this book is one of my favorites yet."
2,Excellent portrait of a teenage girl,"I love the concept of a middle class girl attending a high-priced boarding school so I probably would have been pleased with any novel that explored this topic. However, Curtis Sittenfeld's portrayal of a slightly awkward teenage girl is incredibly adept and well done. She captures all the mixed emotions that come with teenage girls while exploring the school's complicated social hierarchy. Ms. Sittenfeld's differing perspectives on each year of Lee's high school experience vary and allow the reader to see how Lee matures through high school yet still holds on to her expectations and self consciousness. This is real literature."
1,**SNORE**,"First, let me say that I was sucked in by the cover of the book so whomever was responsible, hats off to you! The other blunder I made was in seeing the author's name and assume that it was a guy who wrote it. This, it seemed, made the book most interesting, a guy writing about a girl in prep school. So I dove into the book with expectations that just were not met in any way. The only person I can see who would like this book is one who is akin to the lead character. She is a whiney and weak character who just gets more annoying as the book progresses. The only interesting part is when they discuss her furtive attempts at sex.I felt this book was a waste of time as it did nothing to leave the reader with any lingering thoughts. I was just annoyed that I had wasted my time on this book. If you are a teen girl you might enjoy this but that might be a stretch as well. There are better books out there to spend your time on."
1,Wish I could give it a negative star!!,"This book was one of the most boring coming-of-age novels I have ever read. Lee Fiora bored the s#*! out of me, there was poor character developement throughout the novel, and hardly any plot. Also, the writer had the annoying habit of Lee telling a story then jumping into her present life and relating the incident in the such a dry and pointless way I wanted to just slam the book shut. Lee failed to evolve in 4 yrs and I could not relate or empathyze with her in any way. The best thing about this book was that it was available @the local library and I did not have to waste mi dinero$$$"
1,A cheap novel with some insights,This cheaply constructed story was engrossing but so full of self-absorbance and self-hatred and so pointless...A major disappointment and a sellout
1,Boring!,"I was really disappointed in this novel, especially after reading all the hype in the NYT. I found Lee, the main character, to be remarkably unchanged throughout her prep school career. She was ""sad and angry"" throughout the whole book and nothing -- not friendship, rejection, embarrassment, or humiliation -- fundamentally affected her. Also, as the parent of a boarding school student, I found the portrayal of her relationship with her parents profoundly misleading. Lee's inability to relate to her family was not because she was a boarding school student; she couldn't even relate to other boarding school students!! Lee seemed to have personality disorders that preceded Ault, but the author didn't acknowledge that."
1,Grinds to a halt,"This book started well, but after awhile it became a chore to finish. The main character of this book doesn't grow, and she has nothing interesting to say. She doesn't have as much money as most of her classmates, but it's hard to see where that really gets in her way. She has a miserable sexual relationship that just kind of goes on and on. So what. The book finally ends and I just didn't care.There were some good sections, such as the parents visiting day sequence when the main character was so (unjustifiably) embarrassed by her parents that her father decided to leave early. I also found the aborted relationship between the main character and the townie to be fairly interesting. Yeah, both of these sections were overdone, but there was a ring of truth to them. Most of the rest of the book was an attempt to make us feel sorry for a character that was totally unremarkable and unlikeable."
1,A disappointment,"""Prep"" was overlong, and I found the prose to be unoriginal and the tone and setting to be underdeveloped. Lee is an incredibly uninteresting and unlikable narrator. There were repetitions of certain small details that made me feel the book was inattentively edited.Additionally, the time period was unspecific; elements eventually pointed to the 80s, but I don't believe that the phrase ""hooking up"" was used then to describe sex or making out.I don't get why the NY Times picked this as a notable book. I found it tedious and pedestrian."
2,Really Great,"I was surprised to read any bad reviews about this book because I enjoyed it so much I practically read it in one sitting. It probably appeals more to younger audiences- I read it in high school and while Lee could be frustrating at times, I found I really identified with her. I read in one review that the chronology of the book and when it took place was confusing, but that's not really the case."
1,Prep,"I was so disappointed by this book. I never really got a grasp of the main character and I kept waiting for a climax in the book - which never took place. It is good writing, but the story needed to spark."
1,"Long, painful and incredibly boring","I absolutely hated this book. At no point was I able to work up the slightest empathy for the whining and self involved main character. I actually laughed out loud and cheered ""go dad!"" in the scene where he slaps her for being rude and distant to her family. It took me over a week to plow through the book and I was left with a distinct sense that I had wasted precious reading time. I cannot imagine why it ever made anyone's best seller or best book list!"
2,I give it 4 Stars for a HighSchool Dramady,"Think Mean Girls (Minus lindsay lohan plus Kristen Stewart)This book gives a very vivid picture of an outcast perspective of a Prep High School outside the Boston Massachusetts area.The main character is not likeable to the reader nor to anyone she comes in contact with in the story, except her closest friend Martha.Unlike in mean girls, where the main character becomes popular and the meanest of the mean, our main character, Lee never becomes popular, throughout the story she stays at the lowerend of the social hierarchy makeup.This was a quick and enjoyable read for me. a good fluffer"
1,"Another prodigy, just what we need.","Well, I guess it's not enough that all of the young lions and lionesses out there have an exclusive (Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Bennington, Stanford, etc., etc.) pedigree that places them in a different social league than 89% of their fellow Americans; now these folks are going to start writing about these delimiting experiences as well. Wow, I guess it's a nice break from the novelized versions of ""Friends"" that keep popping up in front of me like bright pink bubble-gum bubbles whenever I open a magazine. And I guess since the average consumer deigns to sit through a book review only if it has (a) 150 words or less and (b) a letter grade at the end to abbreviate the conclusion reached in those tedious 150 words, we might as well have a book that's all about grades."
2,Great Teaching,"Bruce & Mary do a great job explaining all facets of the golf game. I watched the video three times and picked up more good tips each time. The segments on conditioning and choosing equipment are unusual for golf instructional videos and were very well thought out. I recommend this tape to anyone who wants to take a few strokes off their game, no matter where they started."
1,Horrible,"Natalie could have been a little more nicer to the audience instead of being a prude like she always was. You hardly could hear her voice, she looks like a farmer girl in These are days and really she doesn't show a sense of appreciation to anyone. Her band is too loud....Not a great video, especially to a die-hard Merchant fan."
2,Love this movie....,"I got this movie on time, and in perfect condition. :) I'm very pleased. It's one of my all time favorites. ""Thank you so much."""
1,"Ok, but not worth the time","Another romantic comedy about two unlikable people. Marsha Mason's character is constantly cranky and critical. Dreyfus plays an off-Broadway actor who is somewhat likable but overbearing and difficult to get along with. Both take stances in their relationship that no sane person would, making it difficult to relate to these two. Dreyfus is also saddled with, and we are condemned to watch, a few horrible scenes of an abysmal version of Richard the Third. An hour into the film, Mason softened a bit, but by then it was too late for me."
1,Glad I read Triple Witch first,"...had I not, I probably wouldn't have continued with this series. Dead Cat Bounce just seemed to meander. The characters were flat and the plot was pretty dull. Sarah Graves definitely picks it up in her next book."
2,The Bowl of all Bowls,"I was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day. I grabbed this bowl, tossed in some ingredients and went to town. I mixed for days and days without ceasing...why? Its not becuase I'm a crazed lunatic who likes to do the man dance on the rooftop...no...its because this bowl was magical. It made me sing while I mixed. I sang songs of mixing. Sweet, tender yet robust songs. I'll make an album of my mixing songs. Look for me on TV soon. Mixing and singing."
2,My waffle bowl,"This has worked out perfectly for making waffles. I have to make a double recipe, so the size comes in handy. I was somewhat uneasy at first about the round bottom, but this has been no problem at all; the bowl isn't the least bit unsteady, even when I have the ladle in it for spooning the batter into the waffle maker. It cleans up in the dishwasher just fine also. Alternatively, I use this bowl for making jello, and then is when I really appreciate the pour spout."
1,So disappointed with this bowl!,"Generally speaking, I think OXO is a fabulous brand and I own lots of tools from them. It isn't that this is a bad bowl, just that it is not as good as it could be (try Rubbermaid instead). It's too shallow for most baking that requires using a mixer first (it splatters everywhere), and the handle is so inconvenient when you try to pick it up to pour out the contents. They missed the mark on ergonomic design here."
2,Great tool!,"First, I will admit that I don't use this as a skimmer. I mainly use it to scoop chicken nuggets out of the frying pan once they're done. The oil can drain off and the large surface area of the skimmer allows me to scoop up a bunch at once. This item is very sturdy and well-made. It's one of my favorite ""spoons,"" and I'm always looking for more ways to use it!"
2,"Good information, but...","I would like to have more information regarding what to do next. The information was good, and the illustrations are helpful, but I needed to buy another book to help with what to do with the foal once it had arrived."
2,Almost what I expected...,"...they are inexpensive, have UV protection, but they are a little snug on my head. Maybe my head is just wide."
1,Why not provide sizing chart?,"I ordered this product from a third-party partner. While the tank was of excellent quality, there is a distinct sizing issue with the product. I received a medium, but the cut of the tank is either a large or extra large. When I put it on, I am literally swimming in it (yes, I am a medium with a 31 waist and 44 chest). Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica's site, it is impossible to guess how these items will actually fit once received. I elected to keep it and just wear it around the house rather than at the gym, but I am very disappointed and won't be ordering from anything from Athletica again."
2,Great chair!,"This chair was a big hit with my 14 month old daughter.She loves this chair! So i am really happy that i bought it.Its very light to carry around and comfy for my baby to sit on while playing or reading books.It would have been helpful if it had more height, but otherwise its perfect!Just be careful that it has a backstrap cause the one i ordered didnt and then amazon sent me another one which had a back strap."
1,cute but does not last long,"I bought this produce for the same reasons many other costumers provided here. It is cute, portable and easy to clean. And it is all that, but I have had it for only 2-3 months and is already broken. One of the buckles broke early on during transport or use, not sure. And then the cloth material started stretching until the baby's butt was resting in the chair (the base chair, or the floor if the chair was put in the floor). No more booster chair any more. I had to put a few fillers underneath so it still works as a booster, but now is not portable any more."
2,An excellent biography of one of Rome's greatest emperors,"This book is an excellent overview of the life of one of the Roman Empire's greatest rulers. Williams explains how Diocletian emerged from the chaos of the late third century to pull the Empire back from the brink of disaster. Written in a crisp, clear style, it should interest general readers and scholars alike"
2,5-star SteeL,"I've reviewed all my SteeL products 5-stars. Well built, comfortable in the hand and does the job they were made for. This peeler is no exception."
2,The only peeler you will ever need,"If you own a peeler now that is not an OXO, throw it away. Once you try this peeler, you will never want another.I have never been particularly adept with peelers. I have found that most did have sharp enough blades and did not peel easily. Most required a lot of pressure and caused hand pain. Not this perfect peeler! The swivel design goes smoothly around the curves of fruits and vegetables and the sharp blade makes peeling light duty. You never have to worry about the peeler slipping out of your hand, thanks to its wonderful handle design. The new stainless steel gives the peeler a very modern look.While OXO Good Grips were designed with arthritis sufferers in mind, anyone in any kitchen will benefit from this superb product. Once you buy a Good Grips gadget, you'll want the entire line!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed. First of all, it won't let you copy any real movies-it will eject the tape and say ""tape is copy protected"".This is the main reason I bought the thing. Second of all, the #2 tape deck became contaminated and just showed wavy lines. I tried a head-cleaner tape but it didn't help one bit. No matter how I ajusted the tracking it wouldn't work. This occured just 3 months after purchase. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,The bible of homebrewing,"If your interested in homebrewing, this book is the place to start. I've read it cover to cover several times over the years and have used it as reference many times. It's easy to understand for a beginner and is where i learned the most important phrase of homebrewing, ""relax and have a homebrew""."
2,Get this book and start brewing!,"I got this book as part of a homebrewing kit a year ago. It is probably the best beginners book out there for brewing beer at home. From the step by step instructions for making your very first brew to the many recipes for different beer styles and even a chapter on growing your own hops. This is the A-Z homebrew bible.The theme: ""Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Hombrew!""...and that is the essence of this book. The experienced brewer knows that homebrewing involves strict attention to detail, especially in the area of sanitation, and it can be easy to forget as you go through the process again and again that the _real_ purpose of brewing is to have fun. It's a scientific process, but the bottom line is to enjoy the experience from beginning to end and that is what this book is all about.For those who have always wanted to try homebrewing, but thought it would be too difficult or too expensive or too whatever... Get this book and start brewing. You'll be glad you did!"
1,"OK, but there are better","This was an OK book. I know some love Papazian but it's a little dated and written in a somewhat monotonous style. Some of the techniques are less than desirable, (i.e. pouring hot wort through a plastic filter into cold water sitting in a carboy. Also, I could have done without the projected need to calm new brewers by saying ""relax, have a home-brew!' on ever single page. It is demeaning to those of us who are professionals in other fields. I would recommend just about anything written by Dave Miller, specifically his ""Homebrewing Guide"". Skip Papazian, there are far better books out there these days. BTW, the my first brew was an all grain oat stout that turned out quite well. Skipping the shortcut methods using DME and extract syrups was my first best decision in brewing. Running an all grain mash adds very little time, is very easy in my opinion and creates a much richer, delicious beer."
2,Must have,"Whether you bake pies or quiche or pizza, this pie server is a must. With a serrated edge, it makes cutting easier. Plus you can just slip it right under the piece for easy serving. Love it."
1,Characters could not hold my interest,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, that none of these characters are very likable. This was my first experience with Ian Rankin, after being told many times that I would love his writing [guess I should have started with a John Rebus story]. I never got into any of the characters, did not believe them or their motivations, and really struggled to care what happened to them. Really, the most interesting character is the woman who gets killed in the opening chapter. Finally, just gave up after about 150 pages, flipped to the back and read the last few chapters and the ""twist"" was what I expected. Blah."
2,BUY IT!,"Truly, these tapes were wonderful. As a language teacher myself, I found it an eye-opening experience. Pimsleur has just the right length in his pauses for you to recall the right word or phrase. Its an excellent, easy way to learn a language. I would add, however, it really is for the beginner to gain a measure of small understanding for Croatian, not anywhere near fluency. Still, the pronunciation is quite good, according to a native speaker I know."
2,Memorable drama for any baby boomer....,Thoroughly entertaining drama involving Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood in starring roles about unrequited love in times of tough family values and expectations.I have enjoyed this movie for decades on TV and VHS and now complete the circle with my own CD format.Handy hint: keep a box of Kleenex within easy reach!
2,phenomenal performance natalie!,"can't imagine a more gut wrenching tortuous emotional scene than natalie grieving over her lost love, her breakdown, isolation, and heartbreaking attempt to check out is overwhleming... it was one deep intense moment after another, each yielding more pain and further escape to attempt the bleed out... killer movie, hard to compare with R&J due to the known ending and less contemporary dialogue... have seen this film several times and each provokes the same response, beyond sympathy and knowing there is no way back, ending so unsatisfying but assess they would most likely be incompatible after a short time given Deanie's high maintenance emotional IQ and Bud's clueless nature. ahhhh me, the poetry never really gelled the main theme imo, but the attempt was appreciated."
1,"THIS IS NOT PILATES, and it is a let-down.","the procution quality of this tape low, and the pace of the 'work out' is slow. The title is misleading, as Kries has created her own system based on yoga, pilates, and classical dance - therefore she should not be using Pilates in her title. Her techniques are also not true enough to any of the forms that she claims to be using to be attributed to them (i.e. she instructs exhaling through the mouth, which is not okay in yoga practice)This tape is probably appropriate for people just starting, or with infirmities, but for anyone who is not at a 'basic' level, it will be a waste of money and time. In addition, not only is Kries boring, poorly spoken, and condescending, but the first 20 minutes are virtually undistinguishable from another tape of hers, which I also regret buying, 'The Pilates Method.'"
1,Eminently Useless Collection of Arts & Crafts Wall & Wallpaper Designs,"The description for this book is quite vague so allow me to clear things up before you waste your money. First there is a series of short but windy chapters dealing with various aspects of design philosophy. Forty pages worth, to be exact. The rest of the book is a series of colour plates - ""Studies in Design"" - that are thoroughly hideous, intended to be used as patterns for wall paper, friezes, borders, ceiling paintings, dado-rails, etc. The author describes them as ""grotesque"" on several occasions and he's right, but not the way he intended. If you've ever looked through a book of wallpaper samples, you've got the idea. You can see one piece of a pattern, but never an application in the whole cloth.Almost nobody needs this book. Unless you're researching Arts & Crafts or Art Deco interior designs, or making reproduction wallpaper for the period, it is useless. Avoid."
2,Mercy Rule is excellent,"This is the best freaking album. Which Road and Tell tomorrow are songs to sing driving your convertable on the highway with the top down, singing at the top of your lungs!!"
2,Anybody who does not like this CD has no taste in music,All the people who gave this cd anything less than 4 stars are morons. Dont listen to them just buy the cd.
2,My granddaughter loves this book,It's full of fabulous full color drawings to inspire you. Has easy to follow step by step instructions. You'll find your favorite subjects are broken down into simple shapes that you fit together. It's easy to get the proportions right and learn to spot the basic patterns that buildup into a fantastic drawing.This book is packed with examples you will love to draw. The simple guidelines are so clear - even adults can follow them.
2,Awesome Allstar Artists!!!,"Excelent. Not a bad perfomance in the group. Pruduction, staging, sound quality, everything, A+. The adlib solos when all the artist come back on stage doing, Always There and Watermelonman, are just astounding. Can't say enough about the caliber of these musicians."
2,These cats can play,"I am a Jazz fan in the true sense, from Miles, Trane thru Weather Report, to the Blanchards, Bradens, Paytons. And the alleged smooth Jazz title and format has never captured my groove or soul.With a few Jazz tunes and mostly groove orientated r&b Jazz type songs, this dvd really surprised me. The musicians smoke and they all play at a very souful, passionate and incredible level ! Kirk Whalum can play ! You would not really experiance his passion and level of play unless you see him in concert or on this dvd. Boney James really surprised me, very soulful and passionate player ! From begining to end this dvd is superb ! All I need to say is go get it, and you will not regret it."
2,Some Real Jazz and Some Smooth Jazz,"It looks good and sounds good. If you like jazz with a back beat, you should buy this. This is one of my top five concert DVDs."
2,Full!,"This is a complete collection of Music Studious, Music Press, Manufacturers, and so on. I was impressed by this book when I first read it. I have been in the music business for a long time and I never saw such a complete collection of places to go. Amazing and very useful! I highly recommend it!"
2,great assortment of clamp sizes,"I debated ordering these for several months. I waited for a sale price or free shipping from Grizzly or Amazon, but it never came. The poor packaging reviews scared me, but my two boxes arrived in perfect condition. The boxes were smaller than I thought they would be and each weighed 35lbs. I'm happy with the clamps but for some reason I thought they would be a little beefier. They are solid, don't get me wrong, but I envisioned them being more of a medium duty size."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"A story focusing on the ramifications of the attack on Snow White by Goldilocks, in the main.That main arc is bookended by two stand-alone issues, one of Jack Horner and his time from the civil war, and the last is Bigby Wolf recounting a story about little Fables and the quest for barleycorn girls.The important story involves, Goldilocks, Bluebeard, Prince Charming, who is proving himself a bit of a spymaster, and a plot to have Bigby and Snow killed.Quite good again, as Fables continues to be well done, particularly as the whole fair tale character thing is not something I am disposed to like in the main, but this urban transportation of these characters is good stuff.For Big Bad Wolf fans, there is some gold awaiting."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This phone is a piece of crap!,When I first saw this phone I just had to have it. I loved that is was so slick and slim. No antenna was a nice plus as well. I really regret buying this phone!!! My biggest upset was the battery life. The day I recieved the phone I charged it and was ready to go. I made one THIRTEEN MIN phone call and it already needed to be charged. I went two or three days with the same thing happening and I finally took it back to the store. They(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that I would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn't got any better. I only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. I dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. The only upside to this phone is that its slender. I repeat Please Don't Waste Your Money!
1,Susceptible to Humidity,"External display failed within one month. Moisture sensor dot showed red, so Verizon would not honor warranty. Verizon employees smugly said that it must have gotten water spilled on it. This phone had never had water on it, but I had taken it skiing a couple of times, but kept it securely tucked in my zipped sweater pocket, inside my waterproof/breathable jacket. Also took it to an indoor pool facility to watch a swim meet once. I understand others have had similar humidity problems too, especially with the Motorola phones. Stay away unless you live in the desert."
1,Not for children,"Although this book is about a 10 year old Samoan girl the subjects the author explores are adult. The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence. I'm not saying the book is without merit. It would surely have a place when studying modern polynesian cultures as an adult, but I think buyers should know that it is inappropriate for children."
2,"Check ""Unknown Tongue""","A superb and solid album that is worth buying for the track ""Unknown Tongue"". This up tempo track features phenomenal use of the 'musette', percussion, a heavy bassline and chanting."
1,Black and white pictures??,Very unhappy with this book. Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification. It has a lot of information and very small print. Seriously considering returning it.
2,Great spoon,Spoon is sturdy and the handle is so comfortable when I am mixing ingredients that I cannot use my Kitchen Aid mixer on.
2,serving spoon,"So far I have been totally satisfied with every Oxo product I have ordered, including this Oxo Steel Serving Spoon."
2,Roomful Smokin' out of the Gate!,This is an incredible big band blues album. From the very get go Roomful were a force to be reckoned with. Its leader Duke Robillard is red hot! And the band follows in kind. A cornerstone modern blues album for sure.
1,Film as iconography,"There are films that seem bad at first but open up when seen a second or third time. This is not one of them. The first two times I saw this film, it seemed incredibly beautiful to me. My jaw probably fell open the first time I saw it. But the third time was too much. The film is so incredibly silly and pretentious I almost felt like laughing at some of the scenes. At times it almost seems like a Saturday-Night-Live parody of an art film, e.g. the scene of the monks noisily chomping on pomegranites. A talent for visual composition and an interesting sound track are just not enough to make a good film. Paradjanov had one idea in this film (""Hey, I'll tell a story with a series of ikons!"") and repeated it five hundred times. Even imagistically, there are many many far more impressive films than this one -- take Orson Welles' ""Othello"" as one underrated example. Among art films, there are A films, B films, and then there is this film."
2,From one musician to another...,"These guys have talent. Not only talented musically but God has given Tim Neufeld and his brother Jon the ability to write deep lyrics full of truth. I always hate singers who sound great on cd but then different in concert, yeah not Jon and Tim. They sound just as good live as they do recorded. This first cd of the band's is over all VERY GOOD. Their second cd (Beauty In The Broken) is not quite as good although has a few songs that get a 10 out of 10. This cd though, I can say it's still in my cd player a few times a week and I never grow tired of hearing all the songs over and over. On a side note, the guys are awesome to hang out with and really do have a love for Jesus and their fans. This band has been a favorite of mine and will be for a long time.[...]"
2,Beautiful,This is a collection of beautifully written songs that are beautifully sung and masterfully produced. I purchased their first CD a year ago (independently released) and I still love it a year later. These songs come from a deep place and are amazing as art and as worship.
2,A time in my life when we feared for our children's lives,"This book brought back many painful memories of a time when we could not let our children out of our sight for fear they would be snatched up by this monster and found dead and mutilated,days later. The quick apprehension of this killer was made possible by amazing cooperation by agencies and individuals who put aside their conflicts and worked as brothers in arms to protect the children of the community. They made sure that this man would never walk the streets again. Unfortunately this killer became the poster child for the necessity for the death penalty in this state. It is unfortunate that he is not the last."
2,A Marvelous CD,"This is an amazing young lady who has God in her life. Without God, we can do nothing. She does it all. Hats off to Najiyah, my girl."
1,...quite boring...,"I am a great Natalie fan. I found ""Ask a woman who know"" simply delicious...so this new album is quite surprysing to me as it is boring, dull....she still has a nice voice, but most of the songs don't catch the listener. At least, they didn't attrack my attention...with the exception of ""Day dreaming"" and ""The more you do it""......I hope next album is better than this.In the meantime, let's hope we get a new album from the greatest voice of all time... our dear Whitney nowadays seems to be ready to give us some hot material. She is in our prayers."
2,Can't Keep That Girl Down,"September and October seems to have given us a bumper crop of albums by 'mature' artists and here's another by a truly great singer. This time out, it's a more commercial venture than her jazz oriented tunes. Listen to the 'cover' tunes which Natalie at once makes her own. 'Old Man' 'Criminal' etc. are great songs but the cream of the crop has to be the title song. The question now is, why wasn't this album advertised more as least in this part of the world. Keyboards seem to more prevalent in the new offerings and this one is no exception. If you're a Natalie fan, you'll love it. If you're not, why not give it a try."
2,The Real Thing,"There are two types of get rich books: those written by professional speakers who make a living telling others how to be successful, but whose only achievements are writing books and giving talks on how to get rich; and those written by people who actually ARE rich and have become self-made multi-millionaires in REAL businesses, not speaking and writing books. Masterson is firmly in the second category. I have been fortunate enough to be involved with him in several of his businesses, and he has a pure midas touch for making successful businesses, which is teachable and transferable -- and which you will learn by reading his book. You will never read a more important wealth building book in your entire life."
2,"The ""How To"" Guide To Becoming A Millionaire",There's a good reason Michael Masterson has almost half-a-million loyal readers of his daily email letter at EarlyToRise.com. It's because Michael is a highly experienced wealth-creator and an excellent teacher.Finally Michael has authored a book that offers a step-by-step plan for becoming financially independent in 7 years. I've followed Michael's teachings for about 3 years now. I'm in my mid-twenties and am earning as much as a lawyer or doctor between my business and real estate ventures. His strategies work! Your $18 investment in Automatic Wealth will pay-off a thousand times over!
1,More 'Think and Grow Rich' Foolishness,The author suggests such foolishness as 'flipping houses' and volunteering free overtime to get 'in' with your employer. The author is the only one getting rich from this mess.
1,AWFUL vacuum. Don't bother.,"This vacuum is terrible! I have had this vacuum for over 3 years now (one here buying a different one now). The filter clogs constantly and has to be cleaned or replaced just about every time I use it. I couldn't even tell you how many filters we have bought. I have longer hair, and my hair gets wound around the roller and eventually just stops picking up anything else... Also, when you empty the canister, the dust flies everywhere, creating more mess than when you started vacuuming. Cheap vacuum, cheap results. Research a little more and buy somethine else!!!"
1,Is this a vacuum or a small jet?,"This vacuum sucks, literally and figuratively. That is about all it has going for it. Both my wheels continually pop off while I am cleaning and it is a total bother. It is super loud (my ears ring after I turn it off). I am sure there is some permanent damage happening. Needles to say DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Little Green Machine,I have owned one of these vacuums for several years. I use it more than my large upright. My Eureka has a lot of power and it is easy for me to use because it is so light weight. I gave one to my Aunt for a gift just this Christnas.
2,"lightweight, powerful vacuum.","For the price, this is a great little vacuum. The handle adjusts up and down, and when you put it down to it's shortest position, you can do the stairs very quickly, going side to side. This vacuum is very powerful, and when using the attachments this is especially apparent. Great for cleaning cars with hose attachment. Works on hard surface floors, when you turn off the spinning brushes. We have cats and dogs, and lots of hair, hard wood and tile floors and I have found that instead of sweeping everywhere, I an just vacuum now, quickly, and use the attachment easily to get into corners into small places. Works great on carpets too.My only complaint- the dust accumulates towards the top of the canister, so it has to be emptied more often than it should if the dust/lint/hair would just drop into the canister. It all sort of ""cakes"" around the top. I would still buy it again. Very easy to empty canister, just push a button, it pops out, and then just dump it out."
2,Move over Dyson...,"the Eureka 431BXZ Optima lightweight Upright Vacuum although small in size is a powerful little wonder.. With the bagless filter that really filters the dirt and dust particle and the storage area for vacuumed item, this little puppy works beyond my expectations. So it doesn't have a ball, and you have to move it a little to get to the corners, heck when you save $200 what is a little moving around. It works and that is the bottom line..."
2,A whole new Luffy,"If you originally watched this series on Cartoon Network, be prepared for a whole new Luffy. Gone are the goofy puns (that seemed out of place) and that over exagerated laugh. Instead there is a more serious, although strange, Luffy and a new (more interesting) spin on the story of One Piece.If you liked the other version for it's constant slap-stick comedy, this may not be for you. But if you like a great story with well placed humor, I would recommend this DVD."
2,Maddeningly incomplete,"I agree with all the other reviewers who are frustrated at what got left off. Every time I put on disc number 4 and fail to find ""She's My Best Friend"" from the 'VU' album on there I'm reminded of this. I'm always left with the distinct impression that these record companies should let the fans compile the box sets.The band is great, of course. A legend. Original, timeless music and words. That's why I've given 4 stars. Having said that, the first disc of demos is for completists only. You'll probably not play it all the way through even once.Like others, I'd recommend not starting here. Buy the remastered albums (the 'banana LP' and 'Loaded' now come in deluxe double CD versions), especially the more polished mix of the 3rd untitled album. Then maybe buy this last.Oh, and get yourself the 'VU' collections. So you can hear ""She's My Best Friend""."
2,Must have for any classic rock collection,This is a great album. Songs range from soft hippie rock to totally wierd and dark. Must have for any Lou Reed fan.
1,"Excellent music, horrible mastering","The cd contains the a remastered edition of the original album. I don't know what the engineers had in mind, but the remastered edition makes my ears bleed. The sound volume has been boosted to a way too high volume and results in completely distorted music. Some of the songs are totally unlistenable. Sure, the loudness of the original album is much less than most current releases, but this is no excuse to change that.To conclude: the cd is no remastered edition, but a mismastered edition of this great album."
2,a landmark album,"This is one of the great albums of the 60's.. It represents everything experimental in late 60's art-rock.. There are the cool mellow vibrations of 'Sunday morning', 'femme fatale', 'I'll be your mirror' - and there are the more drug induced hypnotic tracks like 'I'm waiting for the man', 'Venus in furs', and 'Heroin'- it is overall some of the most memorable music Lou Reed and co. would make - John Cale's influence is also felt especially on 'Heroin' and 'the black angel's death song'. This one will blow your mind.."
1,any help?,"Does anyone recommend this album to a classic rocker? I'm only a teenager, but I like AC/DC, Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, etc. I was wondering if anyone would give me an idea on whether to purchase this album or pass it up and buy something closer to what I like."
1,review of the compilation,"I regret that i got carried away by the recommendations given on my previous purchases as well as the other reviews on this compilation""Peel slowly and see"" is definitely one of the worst in my collection.It sounded more like a jam session by a not so talented garage band! Do i say more.Can i have my money back or atleast exchange the same for some better music?"
2,Excelent,"The Velvet Underground & Nico (180 Gram Vinyl)I order this to gave it to a friend who loves it the disc was package in exelent condition ,and the vinyl an the art it's awesome."
1,I don't like it.,"I've listened to this album repeatedly, and I just don't like it. Why should I settle for a band with very little musical talent? There are so many other bands that have good songwriting AND talent to spare that I don't see the point of dripping praise upon Andy Warhol.I wonder if anybody has ever compared Velvet Underground to Phish. I think this comparison perfectly demonstrates the difference between bands with opposite levels of talent. Both have the appeal of a band that never made a deliberate effort to become popular.I realize that a lot of people really like this album, but I think it's completely ridiculous to call it the best album ever. Do you realize what sort of competition is out there? If this tops everything that Led Zeppelin (or a hundred other good bands) ever did, then I must just be crazy."
2,An essential box set,"This is the end all be all of compilations of any rock'n'roll band. We've got early demos, which, if highlighted by a slightly annoying pseudo-Dylan whine before Reed found his voice, are interesting, Velvet Underground and Nico, Nico solo tracks, White Light/White Heat (which remains the greatest album of all time), outtakes and unreleased recordings, The Velvet Underground in the ""closet mix"" which sounds even better than the original release, much of VU, all of Loaded and yet more unreleased tracks.So it's therefore incredible."
2,Nothing Left to Say!,"After all this time and all that was said about this record (and band), what's left to be said?Should I say that this album (And everything else from VU) changed my life and my approach to music? Should I remind you that almost everyone who listened to them back than (and since!) was inspired to start their own band? Should I let you know that I own 5 copies of this album, just in case someday it will be unavailable?Or maybe I should try to describe the dark, raw, experimental and yet so beautiful sound?This album IS NEW YORK, and everything that comes with it.Well, just listen for yourself! and I hope that not everyone will find it so amazing, after all that's what made the Velvet Underground even more special."
2,Confucius says baseball is wrong - man with four balls cannot walk,I've been looking for a real collection to complement the lame jokes I heard when I was a kid. This fit the bill.
2,great,Oscar Peterson with Buddy De Franco sound fabulous together on this cd of the very listenable Gershwin melodies. Oscar Peterson's small group is an ideal backing for maestro Buddy.
1,Not realy my type,"I did not like this book. However, that does not necesarily mean you wont. The main problem is that several (two) of the characters seem to be undecided as to weather they are going to be antagonists or protagonists. And if you didn't understand the meaning of the two words I just used, this book is too advanced for you. I would say that if a person likes a lot of internal strugle, gore, philosiphy (there is a line from ""Paradise Lost"" at the begining of every section, and quotes from various well known novels and poems at the begining of each chapter, not to metion the philosiphy that is writen into the story itself), but dosen't need a lot of action, then they would probably like this book."
1,Good movie - poor technology,"The movie would have been fine had the audio and video kept sync. Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart. Also, don't rent an online movie from Amazon until you're ready to watch it. They cut you off the momemt your 48 hours are up."
2,A multitude of reasons to watch this film,"- Some good special effects involving the spaceship, the weapons disintegrating their targets, the vast subterranean Krell complex.- A simple but compelling story- The performance of Walter Pidgeon- Anne Francis (hubba hubba)There are a few minor problems with the film, like the goofy ship's cook character, but they don't detract much from this very enjoyable, landmark science fiction film.(By the way -- some other reviewers have noted the debt owed this movie by subsequent sci-fi franchises such as Star Trek. This is undoubtedly true; if you've seen the original Star Trek pilot ""The Cage"", you can see the similarities in the space vessels, uniforms, weapons, etc. -- not that they look exactly the same, but that they have the same feel as those in Forbidden Planet)."
2,Forbidden Planet - Cannot review as not available in Europe,"I would love to review this film. I have been checking Amazon for 5 years awaiting a european release. This is THE Si-Fi classic - why isn't it available in Europe and the rest of the world?Whoever releases this DVD - please, PLEASE release it world-wide."
2,KRELL STEEL!!,"Unalloyed pleasures on the big screen finally get a Deja Vu on Deja Vee Dee!! The widescreen, letterboxed format coupled with your best sound system for the awesome all-electronic score, and the ensemble cast that established the ""Star Trek"" format insure this Cinemascope/Technicolor wonder a place on any fan's top shelf! What would YOU order from Robby the Robot?"
1,A real disappointment,I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would be seeing the original CINEMASCOPE print of this sci-fi classic. Sadly the only frames in Cinemascope are the opening credits. The rest of this glorious film has been chopped up to accommodate a standard format. What a loss!
2,Forbidden Planet,"Considering the year that this movie was filmed, the special effects are very sophisticated, and the story interesting. It is fun to compare the space exploration in this movie to what is going on today."
2,Totally Awesome,"Ok, I'm a Baby Boomer and grew up watching science fiction, both good and bad. This movie is still my favorite. I never got a chance to see it in a movie theater, but now that I have my 55 inch LED and blue ray player, heck, who needs to? ""Forbidden Planet"" is truely a classic and will be enjoyed by any generation."
2,Forbidden Planet Movie Review,"This science fiction movie is one of the top five made in the 1950's and is even superior to the original ""War of the Worlds"" made in the 1950's. The story is truly a superior work as the events portrayed are possible in theory."
2,Classic,"Robbie the robot - this robot has been used in so many other shows. The movie also gives some background into human mind. Id, ego and super-ego are the three parts of the psychic apparatus defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized, realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role The super-ego can stop you from doing certain things that your id may want you to do."
2,Forbidden Planet,I have always liked Forbidden Planet. It on one of my favorite science fiction movies. I watch it every so often.
1,a rip off,i would not advise any one to waste their money on this blu-ray package for one main reason. sound track IS NOT 5.1!!! the entire movie soundtrack played out through my center speaker ONLY! the regular 2 disc 50th anniversary has the dolby sound. so if you have that stick with that and forget the blue ray until they decide to include a good sound track. i mean if you are watching a movie on the big screen don't you want surround sound too?
1,Total Garbage!,"Very poor IR quality, the ear cushions come off with ease and the kids lost two the first day. The volume is very low. They are very large and dont fit right on my toddlers."
1,Broke within two months,"I purchased wireless headphones before that were not as fancy looking but that last me for a few years. This one stopped working after a couple of months. I'm a busy mom of three whose kids go to school far from my house. I drive 500 miles a week, and didn't fit in the time to try to return it until now, and my return window is expired. I would not recommend purchasing these headphones."
2,SUPERIOR HORROR REMAKE!!,"IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S NOT BAD. THIS ONE DOESN'T LEAVE YOU HANGING LIKE THE ORIGINAL AMITYVILLE HORROR...SO IN MANY WAYS IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER!AS FAR AS CAST GOES...THE ORIGINAL CAST WAS MUCH BETTER!!"
1,Sorry but this version did nothing for me,"I know people are tired of hearing how remakes are bad and originals are best, but in most cases it's true I was not effected by the 2005 version at all, sure Ryan Reynolds is fun to look at, and the acting in the film was great, but the story changes, and the ambiance through out the film was not as creepy as the older 1979 version, in fact I was so bored half way through that I nearly lost track of what was happening, by the way I watched the film on cable uncut and commercial free so I was able to view this snooser in it's full non glory lol, just didn't like it at all just have to be honestI still feel that the 1979 version starring Margot Kidder and James Brolin is best out of all other Amityville films made so far. Well on a good note the the newest version is in wide-screen format and it's a special edition and also in blu-ray format so that's a plus for those of you who enjoyed this version. thanks for reading my opinion."
1,Don't waste your money,"I went to see this horrible movie with my father and I was dissapointed. How can people in the movie world get away with making such trash? I guess the real question is: Why do people pay money to see it? It is scary, but the plot is stupid. And how can the family dog die? I was very mad about this. I wanted to leave when it happened. Don't waste your money on this movie."
1,This is a fake!,"George and Kathleen Lutz, the people who stayed at 112, Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York, for a very brief time because they claimed they were disturbed by very supernatural causes. I will not deny that there were murders at the house because there were murders but they weren't from supernatural causes or demons. The DeFeos (the whole family except for Ronald DeFeo Jr.) were murdered by the oldest son of the family, Ronald DeFeo Jr. He is currently serving time. The Amityville community confirms that the supernatural things claimed by the Lutzs are just nothing but a hoax to get publicity recognize them. Jay Anson wrote a fake story. I wouldn't want to see a fake movie where the people say it's a true story but it's not. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!..."
1,One Of The Worst Ghost Movies Of All Time,"I just don't see how this could get such good reviews. It's an awful movie with awful acting and no horror at all. They should put this movie in the drama section so people who like horror movies won't buy it. The sequels are ok and would get a 5/10 from me but this one horrible. A young family moves into a nice new house onlt to find out it's haunted and the dad goes crazy. They rip off alot of movies in this like The Shining and the original The Haunting. MGM also did a bad job on this disk for we get a trailer and that's all. I know alot of people like this movie because it's an older haunted house cheaply made movie, and that's ok with me because we all have our own opinians. But just listen to me and stay away from this movie unless you can watch any of the sequels or Poltergeist 3."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a horrible movie! The movie starts out in a good direction, but nothing really happens after the first 15 minutes. It's boring and certainly not scary. I only gave it one star because there isn't an option for no star. Spend your money on something else."
1,Dunno...,"I finished the 60 day supply and didn't really notice any great benefits from it. It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water. Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after. Other than that, it was pretty expensive and I didn't feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews. I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who don't like their veggies??"
2,GET it and see.,If u dont get a good amount of greens & or probotics in your diet this product is for u.
2,Geen Vibrance-Awesome,"I love this product! I mix it in with applejuice or put it in a smoothie. I've been using it for a couple of months now and I feel stronger, have more energy and my IBS is gone! It is rather expensive but definitely worth it."
2,"Wow, this has all the green stuff!!","I have been using Emerald Balance which has Stevia added as a sweetener. It was great if you were making a smoothie but much too sweet if mixed with juices. I like this Green Vibrance because I can sweeten it if I want. It doesn't end up too sweet when mixed in a smoothie with a sweet fruit like a banana.I am not sure why the directions says ""Best taken 30-45 minutes after eating."" This is a product that seems to be taken in the a.m. mixed with juice or in a smoothie. Actually it would to be good to drink BEFORE eating as an appetite suppressant. Could it upset your stomach? Otherwise, this has ALL the green stuff, and then some you could ever want."
2,Best Green Powder You Can Buy,"Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find. It's got everything in it! I mix it in my smoothie with emergen-c, protein powder, yogurt and blueberries, and I've got myself a nutritient-packed power drink to start my day. I recommend it to anyone that cares about maintaining a healthy body. Yay! Go Green!!"
2,Green Vibrance,This stuff is great. I mix it with juice at times and at times just with water. The effects are immediate and the energy is lasting. I mix a glass in the morning and at lunch.
1,taste awful,smell bad and taste awful. I could not sleep well at night after having this product after dinner. quit it.
2,Great,"Deer Woman was my favorite of the two, but you get a lot of bang for the buck with Sick Girl too. DW had the feel of a 70s horror show, and it was also very campy at times, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna cringe, etc. With Sick Girl, you just get a uneasy feeling. The 'sick' girl wasn't the most likable character (which actually helped the horror element), but it was a long time getting there! Anyway, I'd recommend these, not many people seem to know about them generally and that is a shame, they're fun!"
2,Very tasty and fun...,The blues harp playing and the ambience of the whole album makes this much nicer than your average 1970's blues rock.
2,Gentle soul,John Coltrane / Soultrane (Prestige): A very good and enjoyable album. Not his best but one that will be played a lot. A very solid Four Star album.
2,Great!,Great album. Open Your Eyes was played on ER in May and I always have that song in my head. Chasing Cars is a great track as well!
1,Adolescent pop shlock,"Could there be a more instantly forgettable group than Snow Patrol? I mean, let me guess -- you heard a couple of songs, they sounded cool, you bought the CD and played it a few times, and how often to you play it now? Ever? Mgawsh, they become so tiresome so quickly. You'll notice how fast even their hits get dropped from radio playlists? The DJs got bored too."
1,awful,"This is the most bland, uninteresting tripe released this year. Does Snow Patrol have anything to write about, anything at all, that doesn't have to do with love? Snow Patrol seems intent on playing the biggest possible stadiums out there. There is no other excuse for this claptrap."
2,"An admirable effort, but we've heard this all before","As a huge Snow Patrol and Reindeer Section fan, I was more than eager to pick up Lightbody and company's newest effort ""Eyes Open."" But I must say, aside from a few standout tracks like ""You're All I have"" and ""Chasing Cars,"" these songs sound a lot like its predecessors from ""Final Straw"" and Reindeer Section albums. That being said, this album still sparkles with Snow Patrol's trademark sound and Gary Lightbody's sincere vocals that will lull you into its emotional trance. ""Eyes Open"" grabs a hold of you and for the uninitiated listener, its a slice of indie heaven."
2,"Got it on a whim, ended up loving it","There are a lot of albums in my collection that I purchased on whim and ended up hating. This one, on the other hand, I instantly loved. If you're a fan of subtle love songs and gentle yet powerful vocals this album is for you."
1,Bad DVD,"I like Tom Petty but this DVD is bad. I have an HDTV set, but the DVD is formated with the black bars on the top & bottom. Why??? It makes it look like your viewing the concert through a slit. Poor editing too. Fast moving close ups reck the concert feel. The audio is bad also. I have a 7.1 surround sound setup and this audio just sounds bad. Save your money. Don't buy this. There is a reason why it's cheap ..."
2,Perfect Chill CD,"Great CD for any ocassion! Chill, relaxed, perfect for low-lighting chill sessions! If you like downtempo and chill compilations, or Lemongrass' Filmoteque."
1,Find Ways to Supplement Your Studies,"It's not a bad idea to include this book in your studies. Yes, the reviews are primarily true-that being that the content is just too light and that the sample test are way different from the real CSET test.Beef up by using E.D. Hirsch's, Scholastics, and going online to some of the educational websites. It's not a bad idea to order some of the new ones that are coming out (although it seems that some may be worse than the Cliff's). You need to get your hands on MORE resources so that you can walk into the testing room feeling confident that you will pass it."
1,Very Weak Study Guide,"I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide. So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math, geography, ca history etc etc and passed the CSET on the first try. I am not young..almost 50."
1,Read the Reviews,"I've taken the test for the CSET multiple subject, and I can honestly say that the Cliff's book is really poorly edited and drafted for the CSET multiple subject. I'm not sure where the poster who was hyping about the book is coming from, but you really need to look into other resources to study from. The practice tests in the Cliff's is NOT representative of the actual test. The official CSET website is a good way to go. Keep your chin up, save your money, and do well on the exam."
2,Senior / Eldery Easy Sitting Exercise DVD,This seems to be just what my 75+ year old mother was looking for. She says she will use it more when the weather turns bad in the winter season and she can't get outside.
1,Awful,"The format is silly and the exercises too simple. There will be no build up muscles with these few movements. Good only for someone who has been bed-bound for a year, but not for anyone else, no matter how out of shape one is."
1,To A Misled US Reviewer,"Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising', it came from the tour for the 'Rising' LP. It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to ""Beat the boots"". Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the ""jam-happy"" years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try ""Live In Germany '76"", which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!"
1,Not the Edition Pictured,The book I received was the 3rd edition not the 5th as pictured. The copy I received was in black and white. I was very disappointed.
2,Quilt In A Day,"I loved this book. It is a most have for all quilters. The Log Cabin is the most versatile quilting pattern ever, and this book brings it all to you in clear detail."
1,"Horrible, Simply Horrible","I can't speak for the previous books in the series (Kentucky Rich) as perhaps the early story of Nealy was better, but this book drove me nuts! I only kept reading to find out if they would race the Derby, and that was a pathetic short part of the book.Are we supposed to LIKE Nealy or feel a connection to her? God, what a horrible mean and controlling woman--famous jockey or no. I didn't like the rest of the family much either. No humor whatsoever. No romance either. The only characters I felt even some humor/connection/likability for were two of the minor ones, Willow and Jake. Shame.Apparently Fern Michaels has written a number in this series, and all I can say is why?"
2,Kentucky series,"Love Fern Michaels' books! This 3-book series was fantastic! I was loaned the 1st 2, but didn't have the 3rd....such exciting reading, I had to buy the 3rd!"
2,smaller than I thought but very usable,I still think my kata dr 461 is better because of the added chest support strap and wider slimmer look but this will beat any shoulder bag. For long walks be it in the city or at a trail I am always looking for a small backpack to fill my needs. This little fellow was smaller than I thought but still I take it and put it to use for my backup dslr when I go out and about.
1,Another horrible remake,"No insult to the lovely Jessica Alba but after viewing this, she is not ready for any lead roles yet. The movie was basically generic, the acting was sub par and the movie did not have that horror movie feel to it. There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new. The plot was thin and so was the pacing of the entire film. You don't care for any of the characters and trust me; I have been watching and collecting horror movies for years. This one stinks, badly. Hollywood needs to stop butchering Asian films. If you never seen the Ring, put this movie down and watch the Ring instead. Alba could have learned a few pointers from Mrs. Watts."
2,I can see clearly,"Jessica Alba is perfect for this superb thriller. You really feel for her plight, and by the end understand the origins of her torments. I like these kind of soul searching suspense movies as in the end they show the bright side of human nature even under a major handicap. Plus Jessica has real talent and she is easy on my eyes throughout this journey. Get this one for your collection!"
2,Best Shoes,"This it is one of the best products. I recommend it, I'm very according with the purchase.Este es uno de los mejores productos. Lo recomiendo, estoy muy conforme con la compra"
1,horrible record!,"So alright, some hack like me telling you this album sucks isn't gonna prove it right? Well go just about anywhere on the net, (punknews.org for example), find user comments about An Angle and you will see too that everyone agrees this band sucks pretty bad. I was unfortunate enough to see their live show and I must say it is worse than the record. Everyone that plays in the band seems to be acting way cooler than they really are. Bright Eyes rip off? Hell Yes! But even with that aside, this is really just pretentious crap, I mean... hell! Look at the record cover, you can tell they think they're way too cool! Don't waste your money kiddos! This cd is good for target practice, if you want to buy some funny music, go get a Wesley Willis or even a damn Weird Al CD or something!Ryan"
2,The most informitive Hanson book!,"I think it is a great book because I can read everything in the book, and belive it, too, because it is official. I have baught all the other Hanson books on the market, and they all say things that make others untrue, like Taylor is right-handed, then another says he is left-handed, and yet another says he is ambidextrious! So, I think Hanson:The Official Book is worth buying, if you want the truth (and who doesn't?!)"
2,"Hanson Biographies, novels written too soon","I understand that fans all over the world are happy about having the oppurtunity to read books about their favorite band. However, how is it possible that a biography is written about three adolescent boys who have yet to live the bulk of their life. Understandably, their lives have been anything but common to the ""common child,"" however, their lives are very similar to that of a child star. I do commend this book for being the only OFFICIAL Hanson book, and should probably be the only allowed on the market. Unauthorized books print false information that fans know is false. I also commend this book for being the only one that Hanson had something to do with. Of all the books available to fans, I would recommend this one of any, however, I think it may be a little pre-mature to publish ANY books about three children."
2,Excellent!,"The definitive guide to all that is Hanson. If you love their music, their antics, or just their music, you will love this book. Heck, even if you hate the music you might like the book. Mr. Gollihare has a rare gift for writing."
2,sketches of AFI,"now that AFI has become an opverproduced studio crap-fest, Thought Riot picks up where they left off. both this and Shattered Mirror Syndrome remind me of AFI's ""answer that and stay fashionable"", which is nice considering all the wanna-be NOFX bands that have run amock since the mid 90's. in essence, it's hard and fast, as it should be. check 'em out."
2,Good solid Connector,I looked at a lot of cheap Chinese crap in Wally World before I decided to try this. I was fully prepared to send it back if it too seemed like junk; but it was not. It's a quality unit with good copper connectors inside that provide solid attachment inside.
2,Great Grip Spatula,"This is a very versital spatula. I bought the spatula for the handle. The flexible rubber fins on the steel handle create a very comfortable feel and will NOT transport heat up the handle. The oversized grips create a very ""ergonomic"" feel and fits my hands without having to tightly grip the handle.The spoon head is very flexible and yet sturdy. It can be used to stir the stiffist pancake mix and yet still clean the side of the bowl smooth. It can also go from normal room temperatures to stirring the soup, sauce or chili without fear of the blade melting or leaving ""that plastic taste"" in the pot.A great product with flexible uses and a staple in my kitchen."
1,Big Disappointment!!!,"I thought this one might be kind of cool, with a beautiful female Zorro instead of the usual male. The casting was alright, but such horrible writing! Of course, with Surrender Cinema producing it I knew they'd be taking an erotic angle, which would have been fine if only they'd succeeded at it. But no, this one is bland and uninteresting. The worst part was their attempt at a girl-girl scene. It started just fine, but then it's almost like they lost interest and it fizzled away to nothing. Just like the video itself. A waste of time and money!"
1,Good try but wait til they get more bugs out,"If you liked Diablo or Dungeon Siege, you ought to like this game BUT... On my Windows 2000 system even with the latest patch and updated drivers (and on all other versions of Windows according to other reviewers) it bombs out the system after 5-20 minutes of play -- first slowing down to a crawl and often ending with a Blue Screen of Death.There are a few uncompleteable side quests, repetitive go-fetch main quests, and a final act and endgame that are over in three minutes with no challenge. Generally good playability -- mostly hack and slash so the different character type abilities make little difference. And that leads to limited replayability interest.Riding horses is potentially a good idea but fighting on horseback is limited and you can't outrun swarming enemies even when riding.But it's better than nothing while waiting (perhaps forever) for a new Diablo follow on."
1,If I could only play the game.......,"So, I recently aquired this game through this very site expecting it to be a fantastic game. It is as far as I can tell. However the game is so buggy right now that it has ruined everything about the game.I feel like I paid money to test a BETA version..which makes me fairly unhappy. I hate bugs and the bugs in this game are driving me nuts. Even after the update to 1.6 bugs are still aplenty. One bug that is really bothering me is the inability to alt-tab out, or when someone messages me. The game just dies."
2,Bought for my mom,"My mom is older, spends a lot of time in bed, reading or bored, and I thought she might like to try something new. Within the month or so since she's had it, her prowess at the games has gotten really impressive; she likes the fact that it challenges her and she feels it's very rewarding to get a perfect score. The controls are easy to use and the screen and letters are big enough for someone without perfect eyesight to see. I think she's addicted to it, so I'm definitely satisfied."
2,Keep it plastic!,"Brain plasticity is the key! This is great for adults, although like the other reviewer said, not aimed at kids."
2,The Best in Mecha,"This is much better than the other gundam series. Overall all of the gundam shows are the best mecha-type anime there is out there and has the best characters and the best action. I don't even like mecha that much, but out of all anime, gundam has become one of my favorites due to the great character detail and superb animation."
2,Great Item,"I loved the plays in this collection of Noel Coward, but the condition of the book I received was not brand new as stated by the seller."
2,3/8 Flex Conduit,"This is a great product if you have a small wiring job and need to protect the wire. It is a 25 foot roll of 3/8 flex conduit. It comes neatly packaged, doesn't take up a lot of space, and is reasonably priced."
1,The Worst Bellow Book?,The dialogue and endless introspection offered in this book gets tiresome quickly. Bellow's best work came before his Nobel Prize and this is an example of his weakening powers -- when his ideas outweighed action to create tedious novels.
1,Not what I thought they were ...,"These are okay. My son ""tolerated"" them, so I will give them 2 stars. Otherwise, they are mushy dogs -- and not tasty. I love the Worthington Superlinks and I thought these would be comparable."
2,The Scratchless Wrench,This strap wrench replaced an old one that wore out and that I missed a lot.It grips items that cannot be gripped with other tools because there are noflat surfaces to grip or because gripping them would degrade the appearanceby marring or scratching the surfaces. It is ideal for fittings on faucetson sinks or bathtubs and any polished surfaces on pipes that need to begripped for turning.
2,Great Shoe,I have wide feet. They are true to size. I can even sleep in them. I walk and stand sometimes 12 hrs. This shoe is light weight and comfortable. I highly recommend this shoe to anyone that has had a problem in the past finding all day comfortable shoes.Shipping was good and they arrived just as pictured and stated. I am exceptionally happy with my purchase.
2,Third pair....,"This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Romys I have owned( wore the first two pairs out). They are great for everyday use as well for long walks. They are light weight, so very comfortbale and look great. Would rate as probably the best all around sneaker."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"My daughter received this for a birthday gift and was thrilled when she saw the box. However, after taking the pieces out and putting them together, and putting them together, and then putting them together AGAIN, she lost all interest in it. She loves the 2 cats from the movie and was most excited they were included. The wedding arch falls apart if you look at it wrong.I would not spend my money on this unless you intend to sit there with your child and reconstruct the thing every time she moves."
1,uplift teakettle,"I was dissapointed in the color. Its listed as mock yellow, but it is mustard or a goldish color. Also the whistle sound is obnoxius. I would not reccomend this for just anyone because the tip and open spout could be awkward and dangerous in the wrong hands."
1,A whistling tea kettle which doesn't whistle.,I love OXO products except for this tea kettle. I -need- a kettle that whistles and this one doesn't. I burned up my first one of these and am now on my second. Both were gifts or I would have returned them. The steam comes out around the base of the spout.
2,careful!,"These tea kettles are GREAT! But don't leave them on the stove with no water after the whistle stops working, because the enamal will CRACK when you go to refil. Duh---"
1,Expensive / poor quality,"Initially, I was put off by the cost, but figured it must be a quality kettle. Within a few months of owning the pot, the handle to the water reservoir broke. An end of the plastic handle pulled off the lid. No problem, I just screwed it back in. A month later it pulled out again. This time, I unscrewed to the handle to find that the screws were only held in by a metal collar embedded in the plastic. The metal collar somehow stripped and pulled out of the plastic. The handle was permanently broken. I pressed the handle and lid back on and started filling the kettle through the pour. The screws holding the handle on the lid started to rust.I also found the pour handle clunky. If you don't hold it level, it will pop open unexpectedly and splash water out. Not a big problem for me, but my wife (who is petite) always had a problem holding the pot with one hand.The pot is getting replaced. 50 dollar piece of garbage."
1,Rusts inside!!!,"Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle, Brushed Stainless SteelI bought the green enamel Oxo Good Grips Uplift Tea Kettle 2 Qt. capacity less than 6 months back. I use it daily to boil water for cooking. I take good care of it- keep it clean and dry when not in use. Unfortunately, it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle. This is definitely not worth the money.2 stars for the good looks and the comfy handle."
1,Design Flaw,"This teakettle has a design flaw. The handle on ours started to come loose within a month or so. It has to be retightened every week or it almost falls off. The loosening occurs at the spot where the handle is attached and by the uplift, which creates a constant yank on this spot. Very frustrating for an expensive, otherwise good tea kettle. Don't but it. The problem is inherent on the design."
1,Not Recommended,I like nothing about this kettle. The handle shifts unexpectedly which makes it awkward to move to a different burner and downright dangerous to pour. The instructions say to empty after use. It feels flimsy.
1,"Poor quality, like everyone says","I actually purchased two of these. The second was purchased when the whistle stopped working on the first (I thought the broken whisle was my fault because it ran for a few minutes). Both lasted about a year. Here's what's not to like:1) Rubber handle splits along bottom seam2) Whistle stops working after a short while3) Hard to refill with water if hot, steam burns your hand4) Lid difficult to open/close5) ""Stainless steel"" mars easily, does not retain appearance6) Takes forever to boil contents7) Bottom seam leaksMany other reviews echo these same experiences. While it appears to be a nice unit from a company that normally has a good reputation, it is not. Be forewarned, don't but this item."
1,Worst teakettle we've ever had,"When I try filling this thing with water, it keeps closing - gotta hold it by the neck to keep the spout open to put the water in - can't wait to get a replacement. Also, on our gas range, the handle gets very hot - need to use a pot holder to pick it up."
1,Tracy,This teakettle is the worst! After one week of use it's already rusting inside. The lid has cracked from the heat. I am very dissapointed. Don't purchase this one. Keep shopping for a different brand.
1,I could not use,"I could not use because the CD is damaged, therefore I can not say as the product is not in question"
1,Mechanical Challenges,"The form factor on this gem is fantastic! However, the adapter will not accept a three prong, grounded plug. The plug will go in after using much force. It worked fine for 2 insertions. After that, the internal fuse blew. The spare was used and the fuse blew again. Finally, I threw the adapter away. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to use a grounded plug."
1,Very bad...,It worked for few months after that it is spoiled. Not working any more. I think it is very cheap (not in the price) product. I never recommend to anyone
1,"Piece of Junk, Do Not Buy","I bought this adapter for international travel.It never worked.It arrived DOA, although I only found that out after it was too late.I was very lucky in my travels to be in places that had plugs that were US friendly and electronics with 110-240 transformers.Avoid, do not buy. You are better off with the Radio Shack plug adapters.Buyer Beware!"
1,Better Option,I bought this device thinking I would save money over buying multiple plug adapters for Germany and Australia... big mistake. I found that I could buy single plug adapters for each country for just $.99 each.
1,Not very small adapter,"This adapter is certainly not small. It is large because it is an all-in-one, which sounds good, but in reality doesn't cut it. It is so big that it sometimes will fall out of sockets. The internal fuse also blew-out when I was overseas rendering it useless. I am now using the much smaller regional adapters which can be purchased at Office Depot or Staples for $3-4."
1,disappointed that it doesn't fit power outlets in INDIA,I have read a review that says this product also works in INDIA but came to know that neither of the given 4 different power plugs doesn't fit indian power outlets.
1,Did not work in the UK,"Stayed at two hotels in the UK and this device did not work in either one. Would love to get a refund of this piece of junk. I have a number of other Kensington products, all of which work reasonable well, so this is a particular disappointment. Luckily for me, both hotels had built-in US plugs."
1,Does not work as advertised...or at all,"As I have found it, these all in one packages do not work well. Especially this one. Tried using it in Germany, and it failed. Yes, it was a problem that it does not work with three pronged plugs, but it was a bigger problem that it wouldn't even work with two pronged. I tried everything, and I know it isn't a voltage problem."
2,Great Product,"Great product, convenient in many different countries. One note is to make sure you carry an extra fuse in the event you should blow one. Very easy to use and change them, though."
1,"Supposedly for computers, NOT","As has been said, this item is a complete piece of junk. The package and labeling advertise it as a plug for use with computers and computer accessories. Except all modern computers are three pronged (ie, they have a ground). This plug does not have a female three prong US. It is thus completely useless, and I am returning both of the ones I purchased."
1,travel plug adapter,I am going to France and needed an adapter for my appliances. After purchasing[ASIN:B0002H4YUI Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter]] I found it would not work without another purchase of a devise to change the voltage.
1,Wrong sizing and inconsistent sizing,I received two of these shirts of the same size. Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid.
2,A Very Fine Camera and Lens System,"We purchased the camera just before leaving for a long vacation. Really wanted the 18-200 lens so I would only need to carry one lens. Shot just over 4,000 frames in a variety of light conditions with various amounts of zoom. Used both CF and Memory Stick Pro media for capture. Both worked very well. Camera and lens did exactly what I wanted.The downside is that the combination is a little heavy and it takes some practice in low light, non flash environments [museums and evening lights] to hold the camera steady. My wife finds the combination too heavy and prefers her little digital point and shot for most things. After having used an old Sony Mavica, not having a long shutter delay is an absolute delight. Was able to take 26 images in about 90 seconds of our granddaughter practicing for her ballet class. Images were very clear and froze the movement of her hair and tutu."
2,Great camera,"I just moved up from a digital point and shoot, an Olympus C-60 which takes excellent photos. I was into photography seriously years ago and owned a Minolta SRT101.After spending considerable time researching digital SLRs I chose the Sony for a number of reasons: its anti-shake and sensor cleaning features and the fact that there are so many Konica/Minolta lenses available for it.I have no regrets. The camera is very easy to use, the menus are intuitive and the controls are easy to learn and use. Images are awesome! I have used both the kit lens and a used Minolta 70-210 zoom. Some of the photos I have taken look totally professional. I was never able to get images anything like these with the old SRT101!I am having a lot of fun with this camera!"
1,Timelapse recording,"This camera has not timelapse recording!!!(Cameras with a time lapse feature can be programmed to automatically shoot a number of frames over a period of time or with a certain time interval between each frame. For instance, a camera on a tripod in time lapse mode could be set up to shoot frames of a flower opening or a bird building a nest.)"
2,Superb energy of live hip hop performance,"This is a completely new dimension of hip hop. For ones that haven't seen them perform live this is an unique experience. Definite must in every serious cd collection, even to those peeps who are not into hip hop at all. Also on second CD you have two videos of them performing and few new tracks. What else could you want. This is a live stuff that breaks all the barriers of the music as we know it today. It's not like DefJam's ""Survival of the Illest"" where you had MC droppin' lyrics and DJ spinnin' on 1&2. Yes, Roots have scratch sounds, but they are produced from the mouth of two vocalists - Rahzel and Scratch. Also, combination of bass (Hub), drums (?love) and rhodes (Kamal) is da bomb. It's the pure energy, even though it's not played agressively at all. And finaly add Black Thought to drop some lyrics and you have The Roots on stage. Sounds superb!"
2,The Country-fied Album,"Great record. A good mix of songs and sounds. With 23 tracks, well worth the money"
2,DogRead Book of the Month,"DogRead book of the month July, 200o This book was chose to be on the prestigious 'DogRead' as a book selection of the month. We only do 12 books a year. The author comes on line for the whole month to answer questions on the book. George was very well recieved and his book recieved rave reviews. We found it easy to follow and great for the newbe or the long time owner. It was very well received by our 3000 member email group. The author was very knowledgeable and easy to understand.treshell owner DogRead"
1,I wouldn't waste my money,"I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.If you really want a good book read: ""Making it to Westminster"" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down!"
2,LOVE THIS CD!,"THIS CD IS BEAUTIFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING IN A GENTLE MANNER,DEFINATELY WORTH THE INVESTMENT."
2,Awesome Job!,"This CD is the best I have heard in a long time. I listen to it every day at least three or four times. I just wanted to tell everyone that they should get this CD even if they don't think they would like it... like I did. After you hear it once, you can't stop!!!"
1,Would give no stars if it were an option,"After using only a few times, the bristles fell out in big clumps. I was using it to brush olive oil on filo dough when it starting falling apart, and I wondered if the oil had softened the glue that held them in. Will look for a replacement that uses something besides just glue to attach bristles to the handle."
1,Amazingly bad,Planned a road trip just for the purpose of listening to this box set... just as I had done for the great 70s and 80s Rhino boxes. I cannot believe how bad this is - particularly how unrepresentative of the decade it is. PLEASE Rhino - try again.
2,great album,this is probably my favorite vu record. the band's songs are more melodic and less experimental noiscapes that characterized the content of their first two records. the modern lover's first album is very influenced by the vu music recorded in this era. i like the vu's music from this period.
2,A Small Point,"I have just a small point to add to what's been said. In my humble opinion, based on 25 years of assiduous listening, Foggy Notion is one of the ten greatest song rock songs ever. (On it the Velvets rock'n'roll like the Stones, jam like the Dead, groove like the Groovies, and tell a story like no one else.) Moreover, as far I know, the version on this album is the only one with the opening six guitar notes that originally introduced the song and which have been edited out of other versions. For that reason alone, the album's a must buy."
2,"The clamps work, the price can't be beat","I looked at these and the other 4"" hose clamps Amazon is selling and couldn't tell a difference other than a huge one in the price, so I ordered 50 of these for a new dust collection system. They came quickly and work fine. Several out of the 50 had some problems, mostly missing the small washer at the screw end, which is easy to find a replacement for.I don't see how Jet can charge almost almost $5 for one of these clamps when Grizzly charges $5.90 for 10. Even with the shipping you come out way ahead. If you compare the pics close they look exactally the same. Save your money and buy the Grizzly."
1,"Grizzly, Not worth the savings.","Grizzly seems to be a good buy, and sometimes it is. But not always. When they sent me the wrong part, I had to pay shipping both ways and a re-stocking charge. I bought a set of supposedly precision screwdrivers. The tips were not even machined. To return them, I had to pay shipping both ways and a re-stocking charge. My advice is to shop for deals on name brand tools. The only time I buy from Grizzly is when I cannot obtain the item anywhere else."
1,Great Clamp - High Shipping,Clamps are great. Small issues with a few but nothing unexpected. That is until you realize that the standard shipping alone is more than the product cost. $7.70 to standard ship a $6.99 product?This bear bites!! READ THE FINE PRINT FIRST.....
1,Not worth your time,"B and low budget horror is typically my favorite genre. A movie can be a great movie despite its budget; any movie, regardless of budget, must achieve certain qualities to be a good movie. Good acting, good camera work, etc, all must be there, and are certainly attainable with low budget equipment. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't achieve any of those elements. I will say this is by no means the worst horror film I've seen, as it offers some redeeming qualities. It just doesn't present anything compelling; the acting is mostly very weak, and the story development is way too slow. None of this is especially annoyingly bad, but it isn't enough to overcome the terrible special effects. The ""horror"" parts are simply awful. There's a scene of a witch stabbing people who have to be standing 20' away. Again, not the worst I've seen, but definitely in the bottom 20% of my viewing experiences."
1,0 STARS: HORRIBLE!!!,"""Witchhouse"" is an artificial low-budget supposedly horror-comedy hybrid (plenty of unintentional comedy but zero horror) which is truly lame and totally ridiculous. In the mold of ""Night Of The Demons"", ""Witchhouse"" is about a strange girl, Elizabeth, who decides to have a party with some of her carefully selected friends at an old house named Witchhouse. Elizabeth's ancestors were Satanists and she uses a little witchcraft to conjure up one of her beloved relatives. Plagued by bad make-up, pathetic special effects, horrible acting, a poorly executed plot, and a lifeless and pathetic script, I can say without reservation that ""Withchouse"" is a total zero and a complete utter joke. Maybe a good one for the brain-dead juvenile delinquent in your home, but that's about it."
1,it SUCKS,"I rented this movie just last week, after the first 30 minutes i realized that i had already seen this before,latenight on cable.One of the worst B movies ive ever seen. Bad acting,bad filming,nothing realy scary."
1,Given as a post hospital gift,My mother and father found it to difficult to use. In their eighties I thought it would keep all of mom's medications lined up but tey were unhappy and went back to doling out their pills from each bottle when they needed to be taken.
1,Poor Quality,"Poor quality, will not last. Opened pkg, very large, lots of room BUT....one of the lift out sections had problems with the lids, very difficult to open each section, also one of the ""hinges"" on one compartment was severed 3/4 of the hinge. It is now holding together by a tiny bit of plastic. I had already loaded all but the last section with pills. If you choose to buy this check everything first, open and close the lids and inspect carefully and be prepared to return this.I had a smaller one I have used for years, finally one of the latches broke and I thought it was time to upgrade. Don't waste your money!"
1,Not good quality,"This is very cheaply made. Two of the doors on the compartments were nearly broken off upon arrival. The other compartment doors are not secure, they wouldn't stay closed in a purse, for sure. I returned this item. Barely dollar store quality."
1,Don't bother buying it!,"this dough blender is pretty useless. the wires are not reinforced which makes cutting cold butter into the flour almost impossible and very time-consuming. you're better off just using two knives or your fingers than this dough blender, that's for sure. what a disappointment!"
1,glad I came here first!,"I was going to take my young kids to see this ""family"" movie. I was checking the showtimes and saw it was PG-13! I thought I'd better check it out. Now I hear that the coach is inside Hooters and singing ""Cocaine"", and there is a lot of swearing in the movie. Why? What is the point? I guess we'll have to pass on this one. Maybe we can rent the original instead.Another rant: The Fantastic Four is heavily advertised on kids tv channels and Burger King has Fantastic Four toys in the kids meals. (Kids meals are for kids 12 and under) The movie is PG-13! My kids have been wanting to see this, but again, I must say no."
1,Poor language & equally poor message,"This movie is a far cry from the original.I lost track of how many times the kids and adults in this film swore gratuitiously. Worse yet, when the winning team acknowledges the Bears hard work and achievements, instead of viewers being rewarded with a scene exhibiting good sportsmanship, the film makers decide to have the losing team learn nothing, except how to deliver the film's seemingly trademark message of ""Kiss my ***""."
2,It is one of the greatest games for gameboy advance!,"It has groovy tunes, the best stars(Marykate and Ashley)and you definetly have to buy this toy! Once you play it will never want to stop! If you want something totally sweet this is it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,pretty good,"I have always loved this band, this is not my favorite of their albums but it is pretty good"
2,WE LOVE DORA AND BOOTS!!!,My 3yr old girls LOVE this product! This is something they actually play together! And that doesn't happen unless they are being mischievous. Even my son who is 6 also plays the games and likes it. It has the real voices from the show and all the familiar characters they know. It teaches simple spanish words that my girls love repeating through out their busy day. I would recommend this to any Dora fan.
1,Can't believe I bought this,"One word for this cd: HORRIBLE. I tried to listen to this four times and hated it more with each play. I can't begin to tell you how awful this cd is. I was reading the 5 star reviews on here with bewilderment. Then one of these reviews calls this 'the anti- Beatles' and this person goes on to say the Beatles are hated. It makes sense now. If you hate great music, you'll love this cd. If you love great music, you'll hate this cd."
2,Great for small jobs,"I use this for small jobs that I don't want to get a hand mixer our for. I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon, but I wish the very end had a bit of a pointed tip. It would make it much more useful when making gravy on a saucepan on the stove. Other than that, it is great and makes awesome pancakes and scrambled eggs."
2,A MOST PROMISING NEW TALENT,"Karrin Allyson has everything to become very quickly a singer extraordinaire: the voice, the personality, the musicality and the humility. Even if I must admit that she sings in French less convincingly than in Portuguese, where she sounds great, it's difficult to find something to criticize in this almost flawless charming singer. But, but...I see that noone (as far as I know) noticed the incredible similarity with the voice of the late Silvia Telles, the great Brazilian jazz singer once praised by Ella Fitzgerald herself. And not only the voice, but even the repertoire: this mix of English, French and Brazilian songs... But that doesn't matter. Karrin Allyson is alive and has her own talent that will surely grow to become a true reference!"
1,"Hated the Movie, Loved Adrian Paul","I knew this movie was going to be terrible before I bought it, however, I'll watch anything with Adrian Paul in it. Huge fans of Paul's will probably do the same. If you're not a huge fan, I'd recommend skipping this movie and getting ""Premonition"" instead."
1,Save your money,"This movies is SO BAD, my true rating would be 5 black holes. It looks like it ought to be good--John Landis, the actors, but trust me, this would have to get way better to become merely BAD. Think three stooges, with PMS and guns. I got this because I am an Adrian Paul fan; I know some film work is better than none, but if you too are a fan, save your money and watch some old Highlander episodes. This actually hurt to watch."
1,DVD looks videoy... Not theatrical version,"While the film itself is excellent, the DVD (and VHS version I presumed) version is not the same version in its theatrical release. They simply encoded the original digital video version and the ""film"" truly looks like a video on DVD/VHS. They should have telecined the film-transfer/35mm version which has the depth, color and grain of film. It's much better to watch the print in a theater..."
2,Job Boss Compressor Review,This compressor has delivered in all of the areas I expected. It is very portable and easy to use. CFM output is very adequate for small jobs or larger demands for short periods of time. My only disappointment was with the handle assembly. I feel that it should be more secure with some sort of locking mechanism.
2,Great clean-up tool,"I have to admit - I actually just use this scraper as a scraper -- cleaning up the counter tops after cooking/baking/rolling, etc. Perfect size, dishwasher safe, and does the job! Great add-on to all of my other OXO tools!"
2,Worth it.,"It's so useful. I use it for shoveling off the cutting board into the pan mostly, but it's super nice for baking pastries. The sharpened edge is handy for easy chopping if you notice something that slipped through the process. Would buy it again. I'd only hand wash this though, keep it out of the dishwasher (as with all other knives and anything you want to last for awhile). I've had mine for awhile and it looks brand new. It's one of those things that you can't imagine yourself using, but once you have it you realize how much time it saves. Get it, you'll be glad you did."
1,Quality problems,"I purchased a few of these for myself and friends. From the day I got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool, especially since I could use it when making sauces or frying onions and veggies. One day when making a non-meat tomato sauce the handle simply broke off leaving the handle in my hand and the spatula in the pot. I wrote to OXO about this twice in the last 2 months with no reply and this is most frustrating to me. Anyway, I am now using a KitchenAid product which feels much more sturdy and KitchenAid responds to e-mails IMMEDIATELY."
1,oxo needs to use the tools they sell.,"I like the fact that the spoon doesn't stain that is great, but I never want to use it because the shaft is so flimsy. So I recommend you buy it if you are only going to use for thin sauces. If you need a multi use spoon look somewhere else until they add a backbone to this one."
1,Waste of Money!,It might work on wooden Cork's but it does not work on Plastic corks for Champagne. Waste of money!
2,Nostalgiatopia,"Take a walk down memory lane with this handbook on how to survive in the great outdoors. You'll learn how to dig out a canoe, build a tent, or even make a fishing pole."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"I was really disappointed in this title.... It was written in 1890 and it's totally outdated. As an interesting browse in the library or book store, maybe. The stuff it talks about is simply impractical for most kids. Topics range from taxidermy at home, raising wild birds, to making blowguns. I was looking for things I could do with my young kids, and this didn't fit the bill for me."
2,After Boy in a man's world great follow up!,"I have to say this album not only took me by surprise but made me like this band even more because Boy in man's world was just a little predictable and simply written, this album has more diversity and lets the world know that Mucky Pup can do more than just funny lyrics and catchy punk beats! The last three songs are the albums best and there are some great funky and heavy punk songs before them! Hotel penitentary is the big stand out of the early songs! If you like bands like Fishbone, Suicidal, Gang Green, MOD, DRI, even newer bands like Blink 182, American Hi FI, and Everclear you should give this a try!"
2,It works.,"It works okay but it is a little awkward to use at times. On occasion you have to tilt the blower to actually aim at the leaves etc. you are trying to move, this can be somewhat difficult and bothersome. The good thing is that the engine you are using is probably already warmed up and you don't have to cold start another engine after you are done trimming your lawn."
1,Came damaged but is also cheap,"I was disappointed with this product. The tab is broken on one of the days, which makes it very hard to open. Also, the lid won't stay closed on another day. Plus, the trays don't click into the stand, they just kind of rest inside it and slip out very easily. I am returning this item."
2,Cool idea!,"I Like it... Definitely allows me to keep track of my meds intake. But it would have been better if the am/pm slots had separate openings. Besides that, its a cool product.."
2,Cheap but neat little tripod,"Tripod is a nice size to carry with you and use on the hood of a car or any flat surface, if your camera is fairly small. It is sturdily built for the price, but the leg extensions do not lock, so take care when using it.Good value for the price."
2,Great purchase!,"I love this whisk! It is comfortable, large in size and does a great job. What else could you ask for in an affordable whisk?"
1,"Genocide, how does this benefit me?","I can appreciate where he was going with this book but how will the systematic annihalation of the african american and jewish races help my daughter come to grips with the problems youth face in the 21st century??I enjoyed the illistrations but the word ""towel head"" deeply disturbed both my daughter and I!"
1,Unfortunate boring mediocrity,"As a huge Circle Jerks fan, I was extremely dissapointed in wonderful,VI and Oddities.Sure they still have that great sarcastic sense of humor.Keith Morris has his lyrics down cold and they are brilliant.Nevertheless,the music itself sounds rushed,thrown together and seriously lacking in the energy department.I found it to be very bland sounding and uninspired.I do not recommend any of their last 3 studio albums unless you are an absolute die hard and just have to have them.Stay with Group Sex and Wild in the Streets.Those are treasures."
2,Accurate Translation of the Quran,"It is essential that everyone become familiar with the fastest growing and most dangerous religion in the world. Other than the fact that this translation replaces ""Allah"" with ""God"" to make it more palatable for the less enlightened, it appears to be an accurate translation that reveals Islam's true nature and avoids the temptation to obscure the passages that reveals the dark nature of Islam."
1,truly awful transaltion!,"Now, regarding the Quran and other scriptures, you know from the start it's going to be a slow read. Writers like Mohammed, St Paul, and others were not word-savvy and couldn't make a gripping read like Ian Fleming, JK Rowling, or Jean Auel. Nor did they care: their mission was to ""speak God's word"" not to entertain their converts.Nevertheless, when I picked up this book, I soon realized that even Mohammed was better with words than this. He was, after all, an Arab, and the Arabs has long cherished the word as art (hence their beautiful calligraphy and poetry). But this book was beyond dry. Even though I was prepared for repetitious narrative, like that in the Bible, I seriously felt like I was reading a telephone book. It totally killed my appreciation for the book, even though I love studying the religous classics. I immediately dropped it and went for a better translation."
1,horrible translation,"i am a muslim myself. I have read the 'real' Koran several times and have much of it memorized. Muslims around the world take pride in the fact that the Koran can never be really translated, that its that unique. Well now i know they have a point. It's like a translation of a fine work of poetry. It simply can not capture the true beauty or depth of the Koran. I have read several other arabic books translated in english in both languages and i can assure you that those translations are fine, they manage to capture the beauty that is portrayed. The Koran is a magnificent holy book, unfortunately this translation gives it a poor image and does not understand what the Koran really says. I would love the rest of the world to read and understand the beauty of the Koran, but so far, the only way to do do is to read it in its original text."
2,Surprise,"I was surprised by this movie. This can be labelled a ""Black comedy,"" because most of the characters in the movie are black and the theme of it is a black-owned barbershop. I am white and to be honest don't like many so-called ""Black"" comedies. This movie is very inventive and is written very well. Some movies like this are made just for black people it seems. This movie, though dealing with black issues, was a movie for everyone. It was very open-minded and funny to boot. I give it 5 stars for being enjoyable, open-minded, and original."
2,"Appealing to my sense of spirituality, fantasy, and science","Zenna Henderson's people are the epitome of what most earthlings wish to be: loving, innocent, humorous to the point of levitation, telekenetic. They're new adventure on earth becomes more and more complete as the different ""landings"" find one another. To have found an earthling school teacher who patiently endeavors to understand the children and their ways, and who finally finds acceptance by their parents through her delicate position was truly a stroke of luck (or could it have been heaven-ordained?)I have been re-reading my ""Zenna"" books for 25 years, and they are truly becoming worn. I've shared them with my friends and children and am now ready to start with my grand-children. The stories are very wholesome, and good ""grandma"" builders. I only hope they last a little longer!"
1,regalo could make a better bedrail,I am not crazy about this bedrail at all. I bought it for co-sleeping with our 6 month old. It was difficult to put together as the directions were horribly written and the illustrations left a lot to the imagination. When I finally got it together and put it in the bed the latch for the rope that holds the rail to the bed broke. I still tried to use it that night and i could feel the rails under the mattress as they are really thick. I returned this one and bought one that doesn't hideaway and includes a blocker for the baby to not roll between the mattress and rail - this one leaves a sizeable gap for baby to roll into.
2,Hard to find classic !!,"Crumbsuckers first album is very hard to find and is a true classic ,Was very happy to get my grubby paws on it for a reasonable price ,I was fortunate to see the Crumsuckers live in N.Y. in 1986 and don`t regret driving from California to do so"
2,Great Racquetball Glove,This racquet had been great preventing the racquet from slipping in my hand.I usually wear out the glove in high friction areas before palm grip wears out.
2,Works well for whatever sifter needs you have,"Works well for a sifter of flour and such. However, don't try to sift something like Bisquick (which I think you really shouldn't do anyway) --- your efforts will be futile! I like the fact that it has a lid on both ends so that when you're filling it, you don't spill flour all over the counter pouring it in (leaking from the bottom). Very durable and sturdy; much better than those that are much less expensive AND cheaply made."
1,disappointed,This is the only product that I have ever ordered from Amazon that I have been disappointed with. It is very small (I looked and looked for a size in the details and could not find one) and you just move the handle side to side to sift and it takes forever! Will not use again.
1,"Way too slow, poor job regardless","This sifter is way too slow--going through just a cup can take over a minute. The shaking mechanism, which I thought would be less tiring than a crank, is just as much if not moreso. Additionally, it doesn't do that great a job of sifting even after all that effort. Buy a crank sifter instead."
1,"Too Slow, falls apart","If you are sifting a small amount and a fine powder, it is ok. But, to sift 2 c flour it takes forever. And don't ever try to sift brown sugar, it gunks-up. Also, the handle keeps coming-off of the sifter mechanism. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this item and tried several different powdered products in it and after 5 min of shaking, there was very little actually went through the sifter. I went to an antique mall and found an old fashion crank sifter and it works amazing and it was only $5. Don't waste your money on this item."
1,This new design just doesn't work,"OXO products are known for innovative design. I have the can opener, the peeler, etc. and love them, but this sifter does not work. I don't mean that it works poorly; I mean that it doesn't work at all. The flour gets under the agitator and clogs the screen after a few shakes. I can't believe they didn't test it."
1,slow and tedious...,"I like OXO products for the most part, but this sifter, is more work than it should be, takes forever to sift even a 1 cup of flour, and leaves your hand/fingers numb. I was not pleased with this product. Helen in Maine"
1,"Had high hopes, but this thing is slow","OXO usually makes great things, this sifter does the job, but if you're making something large be prepared to be there awhile. It's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire. I would not recommend this sifter, just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies."
1,Don't waste your time,"I ""was"" a Josh Lucas fan before I made the mistake of renting this. It was complete trash. Josh has some explaining to do."
1,Mr. Dibbell could use a life....,"""My Tiny Life"" about sums it up. Julian Dibble is, literally, what the British term ""a wanker."" He brings navel gazing to an exhaulted pinnacle. He starts his book well, discussing the strange interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs and MOOs (VL). He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual. In part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has trouble making a committment to. In part, it's a waltz through the lives of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their sexuality. While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been there, done that, then grew up."
2,Whispered Promises,"It does not matter if you are male or female as long as you are a Madaris, there will great adventures and a powerful love that lasts through the test of time.Brenda Jackson rocks again with the Madaris series."
1,Audio is terrible,This is VHS to DVD creation that has horrible audio quality. I wouldn't pay more than what I did for this thing (2 dollars).
2,pretty good,"this is a good CD....nice, upbeat, and inspirational. The best tracks on this album are ""Bring It all back"" and ""Two in a Million"". Bring it all back is good because it offers encouraging words to those who are having problems believing in themselves. Two in a Million is good because it is about having someone in your life, who means so much to you, so much that you believe that you and that other person are just 'Two in a Million' with how good your relationship is. This is a great CD with quality pop songs, for the most part anyway. The last few tracks are kinda like filler songs, not very good, but for the most part the album is great for any pop music fan."
1,What the...?,I listened to this CD because someone recommended it and let me borrow it. I absoloutly hated it. I'm sorry but it's just bad music. They do not need 7 people in a band because only one or two of them actually sing. The rest are reduced to singing choir and back up voices. I have no idea why my friend likes it so much because I absoloutly could not stand it. They are all cheesy toons that sound like something out of disney or something. The minute I put this CD in my player and listened to one song I HAD to turn it off!! If you like bubble gum pop poster bands then you might like it...that is if you're also a fan of one hit wonders...
2,S Club 7 ROCK!,This CD is AWSOME! When you listen to it then you wanna turn up the sound as loud as it goes and boogy! And you don't wanna turn it off! Also this groop doesn't sing about sex. I got this CD because I had heard all the song off of the show. On channel 31. I also love the show. S Club 7 ROCKS!
2,SClub7 CD,"While Sclub7 is not profound music, I prefer this over the breathy sexual sound of Brittany Spears. For younger children, 7 - 10 it is up beat and fun. There are a couple of good songs with lyrics that are decent and offer inspiration. My children enjoy the funny antics of their group. It's light hearted and I don't find myself trying to explain the lyrics or hidden meanings. It is not mozart - I recommend it based on what it is meant to be fun, light and very dancable."
2,Exceptionally insightful presentation of phenomenology,For anyone versed in realistic philosophy (Aristotelian/Thomistic)this book by Robert Sokolowski should both broaden and deepen their understanding of the basics of first philosophy as well as its very meaning. Sokolowski's presentation of phenomenology is challenging but clear. I certainly recommend the book.Introduction to Phenomenology
2,Introduction to phenomenology,"This book will be just great for introducing my master degree students on very important concepts on Phenomenology, especially intentionality. It will also cope with the hard task of explaining what phenomenology really is. I have used the D'Artigues book for many years, since it is a good one , however Sokolowsky gives e new breath to any one looking for a better understanding of that important philosophic approach to our complex and challenging human world, mainly nowadays due to so many conflicting relationships everywhere."
1,My worst book investment till now,"If you expect something like Pit Bull, Reminiscences of a stock operator, market wizards (I&II), Trader vic, Investment Quotient etc etc, you will be worse off than even disappointed. This book takes you to anywhere but successful investment and trading. Talking about trading and investment there are plenty of good ones out there for you to pick instead of wasting your time and money on this. I dont understand how some reviewers say it's a must for the traders or investors. Quite the opposite, as a professional trader, this one is excellent to sell short."
2,"Victor, one of the finest brains ever","I read Victor`s book more than 8 times before I decided to write an online review.A harvard statistician with a PHD in finance, Niederhoffer knows exactly what he is talking about.Although I don`t agree with Niederhoffer about how great Soros is, I almost agree about every thing else including the mumbo jumbo called the Elliott Wave,& Gann analysis that nobody else dared to criticize. Thanx vic for the amazing book and sorry about what happened to your fund on october 97..Waiting for a stronger comeback and another amazing book full of your wisdom"
1,Damaged book! Supposed to be perfect!,"I ordered this book BRAND NEW, and 4 of the pages were creased, and attatched to the inner spine area. The pages would not detatch so I had to cut them. This left the pages damaged. After unfolding the area, I saw that the pages were larger than the book itself,so I had to cut all 4 pages to fit. Now the book is in damaged condition. I can still read the text, but as someone who wants to have a book in mint condition, when they paid the price for it, I am very frustrated."
1,Tedious,"The metaphors are too obscure, they should be used to illuminate not obfuscate. Much of the book entails unnecessary distracting details of the physical setting and the characters. I saw one reviewer call his prose crystal clear- I think it's more an attempt at poetry than prose. Only about 2% of the writing deals with description of emotion and i felt i knew nothing more about rabbit angstrom at the beginning of the book than i did at the end (save the fact he was irresponsible)"
2,Best Movie Mag Around,"If you are a movie fan looking for a read this is the magazine. Empire's strength is in treading a line between in-depth-analysis and shallow commercial puffs. In other words, it is not too serious yet again critical and independent.Ok, the p.o.v. is from UK so you might want to take that into account. Otherwise it is best magazine for movie aficionados I have read."
2,A Womans tale,I really enjoyed this book. The story is definetly written from a womans point of view and I was able to relate quite well. I highly recomend this story as the tale of a moment in time as seen through a womans eyes in Central America.
2,forged note,"I am a student of Oscar Micheaux films and literature. Oscar Micheaux was a man of limited educational accomplishment[8th]grade. He was opinionated and wrote what he felt about afro-americans,many of his opinions were not well recieved by afro-americans because he refused to acknowledge the racial barriers erected against blacks of the late 19th and early 20th century in the united states. He accepted jim-crow as a law of the land."
1,Where's Florida,"We drive I-95 from NY to Florida about four times a year. We use mostly our GPS for speed and routes. I also have and use the ""I-95 Exit Information Guide"" (from Maine to Florida)which is a great book and it sits right next to me. This ""Drive I-95"" was very disappointing to me. The information in it is seven years old, (2005) (3rd. addition) It excludes Maine of Florida and it omits most of Massachusetts, Exits 13 to 60 So its not a true I-95 guide. Its designed to read ""UP THE PAGE"" divided into two different sections driving North or South. which is not normal and is confusing. The center part is the only good part. It reads like a history lesson that makes good reading. (2 stars) I will take it with me for bedtime reading. Too bad the edition outdated."
1,Yawn,"I was so excited to order this book. I guess I expected more of a guide book than it is. You do get listings of what is at each exit to the Florida border on 95- but I was hoping for some reviews(especially on the many many hotels along 95) The most info given on a hotel is if it serves scrambled eggs for breakfast-not if it was clean-or what services it has. Mobil travel guide would have been a better choice for me. Also it reads a little off. The maps in the front representing your trip down to Florida run from the bottom of the page- up(vs going from top down as you are driving) I found this slightly annoying. On the plus side, they do list a few off the road attractions and give a little history along the way. I guess for $20 I expected more."
2,It ALL becomes true!,"I wish I could detail what this recording does , and MEANS for me.This is REALLY!>the 1st EARLY 'RTF' album. with Al D. and.., my favorite . There is NO reason to say how incredible Stanley ,Chic, and Al D. ARE!!!, Because they ARE!.The best,uh,,,*NOVA* that happened for me in 1980 when I first heard this LP as a aspiring drummer, was Lenny White!.. HuZaah! ..A new machine!THUS! there is one final note;They are 4 individual Prodigys!, that if, ONE was missing....would be a SEVER loss to the whole!, or , maybe....NEVER anything without EACH individual'4'.THIS WAS,..IS!>the BEST 1st 'RTF', as IS ""Romantic Warrior IS the 2nd BEST! of our beloved ""RTF"". Just BUY IT!!!!!!!!!! God Bless!"
2,This game RuLeZ!,"Mortal Kombat was the first real action fighting game in pc history with blood and brutal fatalities! The new 3D look (Not as MK4, but much better than that...) gives MK a 'new life' and therefore MKDA will score real high in the 'fighting game -lists' !!!"
1,hate it,this movie is a waste of money. i didn't like it. to boring not enough dancing. don't spend your money on this movie.
1,"Maybe good for travel,","but not of much use otherwise. I know most people will rate my review ""not helpful"", since that always happens to negative reviews. But so be it.I wanted to replace my old Cassells dictionary which was published 1976 and therefore out of date. But as it turns out, this dictionary will not replace it. One reason for it, is that a lot of words are missing. This is understandable given the fact that it has only 400+ pages and my Cassells has 1200+. But somehow I missed that when ordering it, since it got so many good reviews. One other problem is that the words it contains, are not really explained and usually contain only one synonym, where in my Cassells it has a whole paragraph explaining the different meanings (and usuage) of the word.To sum it up, you get what you pay for. It is dirt cheap and it will be good enough for travel. But otherwise it is pretty useless.Maybe my review is too negative, but I have to counter all the raving reviews."
2,excelent product,"it was exactly what i need it. big difference between playing with glove or without. the only problem: medium size is like a small, and i am a small person."
2,No surprises here,"Easy to assembleLarge enough for a 100 lb boxer/mastiff mixI leave my pooch in the garage with access to the backyard during the work days. This kennel gives him nice cozy place to curl up on those cold days in the NW. I placed an outdoor heating pad on the bottom and i covered the top and sides with an old rug to provide some ""insulation."" He appears to like it just fine.If you need to move the kennel around, you might want to have a second person to hold the other end - it isn't heavy, but the sides easily pop out of joint if you drag it. Other than that, no complaints.I haven't closed the door while my dog is in it, so I can't attest to the kennel's ability to hold up against an escape artist..."
2,A celebration of Victorian values,"H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" is at once a ripping adventure yarn and a celebration of Victorian values. The book - the first of the ""Lost World"" genre - features at trio of English adventurers: the elephant hunter Allan Quatermain, an aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his companion Captain Good. Curtis wants to find his brother who was last seen leaving to find the mine of the title.Curtis is a shining example of the aristocracy - brave and virtuous - a knight in every sense of the word. Good and Quatermain are also fine Englishment who know their place. Haggard was certainly in favour of the established order. To modern eyes the book is incredibly racist and misogynistic but compared to other literature of the time is positively progressive.You can certainly see where the inspiration for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" came from."
1,Killjoy,"This book is terrible, unclear and contributed to my thorough distaste for the otherwise interesting subject of economics."
1,errors are abundant,"I bought this book as a first step to preparing for the ASTB. This book is so full of mistakes, from BASIC math to the spacial apperception portion, that I was upset I spent any money on it. Certain sections left me more confused than when i started due to so many mistakes. The author should be ashamed to publish something with so many obvious errors. My first clue should have been the fact that the author 'retired' from the Air Force as a 1LT."
1,Not as Helpful as it could be,"Very basic book, not a large section for what I wanted. There are much better study guides out there to use."
1,The Countess in Red,Dreary and SO poorly written I could have cried! I have seldom seen a work with such flimsy plot and utterly insipid characters. What a shame!
1,"Don't Count On It, Countess","This book is the biggest hodgepodge of melodramatic [garbage} I've ever seen. ""Curious George Goes To The Hospital"" looks like a masterpiece by comparison. Then there's the horrifyingly bad translation, which I can only describe as the work of a deeply disordered mind--Jacinthe Leclerc should either be checked into a mental ward or the Betty Ford Clinic (perhaps both, just to be on the safe side). In short, count yourself lucky if you don't read this one."
1,Rob,"This player had good picture quality and sound, however, the unit boke just over a year after purchase. The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through. It is going to cost $150 to repaire and the warranty just ran out. Needless to say I will not purchase a toshiba as my next player."
1,Lemon,"I ordered my Toshiba SD 1200 in August of 2000. It was broken out of the box. After 6 weeks of waiting, I got it back and it never quite worked properly after that. Nothing you could take it back for -- it was quirky and unreliable, deciding on one day that it could not handle layer changes, on others that it would not read a disk that it read fine the previous day. Well, last night when I ejected a disk, it literally flew out of the tray, still spinning. Now the unit won't do a thing except sit there. The warranty has expired, of course. I will never buy a Toshiba product again. If nothing else, they have quality control issues."
1,Works well...BUT....,"This is an adequate ladle, but my husband cut himself quite badly while washing it. Be careful! The edges sliced his hand."
1,politically correct to the point of obsession,"On the substantive side, the dictionary is unsatisfactory because it does not have the pronunciation and the English part is British English (""boot"", meaning trunk), even for slang (to ""chat up"", meaning ""to pick up"").On the non-substantive side, this dictionary rarely misses an opportunity to give the politically correct cliche (environmentalism, for big government, etc) or stereotype (e.g., for men as violent against women)."
1,nice trainers........,the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they haven't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves. I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it.....and am just about to start the process all over again.....if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience.....second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - don't know whether i'll get the $116 (not including the purchase price which has been refunded now) that i am owed.....i think thats down to amazon....fingers crossed i guess
2,"Kind of big, but nice","These serving tongs are as big as my grilling tongs, so unless I'm putting my salad in a very large bowl, I can't really use these."
1,"No sir, I don't like it.","At the risk of sounding like a schoolyard bully, this guy sounds like a petulant little girl. I can see something like this being big in Europe. This kind of music sounds like it was made in a factory. There is no personality or craftsmanship. I wish Robbie Fulks would do a Christmas album."
2,Great Price,"Was looking for a rainbow maker for my daughter, this was a great price, and a great product. Got another one for my nephew."
2,the future augurs good with these crystals,"I didn't know whether to order the 30, 40, or 50 mm but the 40 is perfect, about the size of a golf-ball! maybe a tad smaller.It catches the light so perfectly. I picked up some cheap (clear and thin) fishing line from Walmart, and it looks sublime hanging in my window (all three in a slant)...especially around sunset.You cannot go wrong with this company. I've bought three from them so far, and all have arrived unchipped. Look at the reviews too, they have excellent service, and you can't beat the price!If you love clear or a prism of colors or just beauty in general, these are for you. No reason to hesitate."
2,Don't miss this one,"I read this 10 years ago after staying at a Shangri-La hotel for the first time - I was 33 years old. Thankfully I've travelled much more since then and lived overseas - the mystique of the Shangri-La hotel chain has worn off a bit, but the book still holds a place in my heart. Don't try to read this when you're in a hurried state or peace of mind is elusive - in the middle of a vacation near palms rustling in tropical breezes is what I recommend."
2,lost horizon,great condition and in a timely manner cannot wait to read this book as it was highly recommended at the beginning of the book a year in tibet
2,One of the best books I have ever read,"If you want to know what more there is to life, read this book. I first read it at 25 and thought it was okay. Then I read it at 41 and found so much more meaning in it."
2,Great book,"Awesome book, very interesting, fairly quick read.If you are one of the people who believes that ""nothing ever happens"" in this book, then perhaps you need to take a step back and really contemplate what transpires in this book. Great books take a significant amount of contemplation to truly appreciate."
1,Not Fun,This game is not much fun. I wouldn't recommend it. The rest of my family didn't like it either. There are 3 ways to answer the questions but only one way really works.
2,Tanx,"Not Bolan's best, but one of my all time favorite T. Rex albums. My absolute all time favorite song is ""Broken Hearted Blues."" If you've bought ""Electric Warrior"" and ""The Slider,"" this would be the next CD to buy. A great mix of rock, blues, and boogie."
2,Changes your perspective...,"I first recieved the book DAVID as a young child... too young maybe. I read the book from start to finish, and I could tell I had a different outlook on life. The things that David went through, and the things that Marie went through, gave me my own strength for my own life. The book shows excellent detail on everything from Marie's fear when she recieved the telegram, to her pride in her son when he went to the park for the first time since he got back. There is nothing I would like more then to read up on David, a sequel? Maybe? Thank you... Jessica, Michigan Please Write with your opinions...Jabeb4me2u32@hotmail.com"
2,Perfect size!,This skimmer is large enough to use in my deep fryer and fits well in most of my pots and pans. I like this much better than the concentric circle design of other skimmers which don't work well with many foods. This skimmer has wholes to let liquid go through without losing the food you are straining.
1,Not as good as it could have been,"Given the positive reviews, I thought this book would be better than it was. At first, this seemed to be a new and interesting take on the supernatural boogeyman-in-the-closet genre. Creepy atmosphere? Check. Despicable bad guys inexplicably dying? Check. Mysterious monster in the dark? Check. But then, the book took a sharp left turn into romance novel territory, which I found confusing (and annoying). The denouement was completely predictable. I anticipate reading another of F. Paul Wilson's novels before adding him to (or crossing him off) my list of authors to follow."
2,Much better than I expected,It's not a traditional Stoker vampire story but it's still not bad. after a couple of chapters it became a real page turner. It really is an entertaining read. I don't think anyone is going to say this is the their all time horror/vampire novel but it does what it sets out to do.
1,Caution: Sail only in pool or bathtub!,"Exercise caution with this sailboat; I sailed two on a lake nearby ... both took on water (i.e. leaked) when heeled over which is what sailboats are supposed to do. The result was one boat sunk with no chance of recovery, and one boat inoperable due to water inside. Use only where you can retrieve easily.RC Sailboat Yacht Remote Controled Boat."
1,Not very fun,My baby boy never liked this. It was a gift and he was never remotely interested. Other toys can be hung or attached and swatted at. This just sits there and to me was pointless. Go with something more fun.
1,Very disappointing,"I received Charlie as a gift for my baby, the first one malfunctioned so I replaced it. The replacement also never worked. The colors are nice and bright, but never has had sounds. It is heavy and hard. After trying twice to give this a chance-I will never recommend this and think twice about other products from this company."
1,Very good acting in a very bad cause...,"The idea that mathematical genius is somehow strange or crazyis very bad doctrine. People with power of innovation and originalthought are produced in the gene pool with regularity.They are almost as likely to be found among the pooras among the wealthy.Much of the real advancement of civilizations has depended on thembraving misunderstanding and persecution to bring their ideas forward.Contributing to their problems as this movie does,even with the very good acting is not a good idea.The Nash's of the world are seldom and very much not the ""rule""."
1,Felt like a rehersal,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while; next to Rabbit Proof Fence, that is. The cast is excellent and I was very excited to see Hopkins again, but aside from Davis' and Hopkins' roles, I always felt like I was watching people act. Both Paltrow and Madden seemed to over act, force lines and otherwise make me feel like I was watching a play rehearsal.So while the premise for the film is pretty strong, its execution just did not resonate with me one bit. Give it a try, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,Here now...,"Allow ol' Butterweight to weigh in here. This movie my feathered friends is a huge dissapointment through the eyes of Charlie boy, although you milage may vary. The character development is brushed aside arbitrarely as the authors assume their protagonists detain universal traits. The action is nowhere near as captivating as say that of Leathal Weapon (starring Danny Glover AND Mel Gibs). All in all a disappointment."
1,Rusted after first washing,"It seemed ok until I put it in the dish washer. The first time I washed it, it came out with a huge rusted area right in the center. That tells me this is very low quality stainless steel. Will not be buying any more oxo stainless utensils."
1,Bad band,The two faced Skagen watch we purchased was a good buy but the owner needs 3 hands to close / secure the watchband. Not user friendly!
1,Not By Any Stretch of Imagination,"I wish that I could send this to the guy who laments not receiving his copy, but instead I will have to use it as a clay pigeon. Corny and meaningless lyrics and pathetic ""musicianship""."
2,Been to airports and back,"My 21"" Ilite (available for under $90.00) has crossed the Atlantic twice (along with multiple trips IAD-Honolulu, IAD-LAX, IAD-ORD). This carry-on iLite functioned well (spacious; wheels rolled smoothly; the iLite has several handles which provided grips for lifting into overhead compartment). On several flights, I chose to check in the luggage, and the iLite's blue shell provided much easier identification in a sea of black luggages. When scuff marks on the blue iLite showed, soapy water and a toothbrush provided the clean-up solution. This iLite is holding its own and has more miles to fly."
1,Disappointing,"This book does not supply the credible witness regarding the ""luminaries"" that I'd hoped for: i.e., marking time by the stars. It has plenty of curiosities.---------------------I'm not one much for reviewing political, religious or other controversial subject matter. I read some of it but don't care to be categorized simply because I want to know what's out there. On such material, I'll likely give 3 stars since there's not a no-comment option."
2,"Enoch, walking with God, angels, fallen angels, watchers","The Book of Enoch by R. H. Charles is put together by the writings believed to be written by Enoch from the Bible, who walked with God and was not, for God took him. The book explains calendars, times seasons, the fall of the angels, the watchers, and about Noah and the flood."
1,Cute but cute doesn't cut it in a busy kitchen,"Usually OXO produces well designed items that have you thinking ""They *really* thought about how this thing was going to be used (and abused)!"" Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles. It's a shame, but you should pass on these."
1,Too bulky; too weak,"I have always liked Oxo, so am surprised by this product. I received these as a gift to replace some 20+ year old measuring cups, because my husband thought they look so sturdy (they do). but they bend EVERY time I use them, for sugar, flour, everything!! And they really are too big to fit in the drawer, which is silly because there is no reason for the handles to be THAT bulky...since they aren't strong anyway. I think they bend so easily because the handles are so long, making the force on the cup higher, but as someone said, if you cant use the handles, what's the point. I hate to replace new (expensive) items, but I use them every day and am not happy."
1,Bad Measures,"I tried to review these at Macy's where I bought them from after following a link here but they don't allow bad reviews on their site. If it's bad - they time you out and won't let it post. Since I started here I'll review here. I didn't get a chance to check the handle issue. I checked them for accuracy because the 1 cup just didn't look quite right. I was correct. It is off in measure nearly 1/8 of a cup! I checked it against Pyrex, Pampered Chef and another OXO measuring cup. All measured true to each other but were way short of 1 cup when dumping from this cup into them. I measured liquid and I measured dry to check it out. Sorry guys - these are heading back to the store immediately."
2,"Annonited, and Inspiring Music",You have to get this CD it is on the money. Keep on doing the work of the Lord. I just love Praise and Worship.
2,We Got A Hit!,"I am so happy to have this wonderful piece of new Who music. It's creative, powerful, inspiring... all those things we tend to take for granted from Pete. The more times one listens to this 11:00 minute masterpiece, the more the inspiration, the melody, the sheer brilliance shines through. I can't wait for the album, and seeing them in person in NY and again in San Jose."
1,Not bad but better books on gay movies out there,"This is quite a neat little book on gay movies, kind of a stocking filler, a light read although quite nerdy in tone. I have been buying lots of books on gay cinema from amazon as needed to research the subject for a project. The best I found to help me with this was ""Out at the Movies: A History of Gay Cinema"" by Steven Paul Davies. It covers the suject decade by decade and is an insightful detailed hisory of how gay films have evolved over the years. Plus has far more detailed reviews of many more films. Hope this is helpful to others who are into gay movies.Out at the Movies: A History of Gay Cinema"
1,1001 Spoilers,"If you hate reading spoilers, don't read about any movie in this book unless you've seen it already. Duralde gives away FAR too much in his synopses, which are in my opinion completely unnecessary anyway. It is his commentaries that are the interesting element here, and motivate us to see the films. Why he chose to reveal plot turns, and thus needlessly deflate our enjoyment of the films is beyond me."
1,The Saboteurs-Griffin,If you think you are getting a Griffin story-DO NOT BUY this! I have never been so disappointed in all my life. This is awful. Characters by name only--plots are not developed! Amazon should remove this farce from their inventory!!
1,I felt sabotaged,"It's too bad that Griffin has become a factory like Tom Clancy. I am certain he had nothing to do with the writing, and the only reason he lent his name to this book was for money. I doubt I shall ever read another ""by WEB Griffin and ....."" novel again, much less buy one."
1,The Saboteurs,"After reading some of the other reviews I feel like I'm guilty of ""piling on"", but this latest effort of Griffin and his son, Butterworth, is a poor relation to other books by W. E. B Griffin.I have every novel written by Griffin on my library shelves having read and reread everyone of them. This latest extension of the ""Men at War""series is a complete disappointment.It seems contrived, very weak, and incomplete as opposed to the page turners normally published by the author."
1,WOW!,"I can but echo Jerry Sapperstein's review. I, too, have read all of Griffin's book and have also reread a few. This one is obviously NOT Griffin. Griffin's economy of words goes a-begging in this one. Extremely disappointing. Don't bother with it."
1,Not Pleased,I was very disappointed when I received this bood to discover that it was not written by W.E.B. Griffin (William E. Butterworth) but was written by his son William E. Butterworth IV. I have really enjoyed W.E.B. Griffins writing style and couldn't even read this one as it was entirly different.
1,poor excuse for Griffin book,"I am a avid fan of WEB Griffin, I believe I've read every word he's put in print. This wanders around ultimately gets lost and is a waste of time and money. Obviously he did not proof the final book. Next time I'll wait and buy a used copy, YOU keep your money,"
1,Sad disappointment,"I bought the book, read it and then sat down to write a review (never done this before). Then I thought I would read what other people thought of it. I was very surprised to find a few (very few) who thought that it was a good read. I am WEB's greatest fan...read them all. This is awful...not worth the paper it is written on. Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book. There really isn't a plot or story line...there is nothing!!! No doubt about it, someone else wrote it. Sorry for the son, he just isn't able to carry on the grand tradition. Major dissapointment!"
1,Griffin disappoints--Sack Son,"I was mightily disappointed in this latest book, purported to be written by my favorite author. Where did he go? The plot was improbable, disjointed. The characters were forgettable. The theme, Our Patriotic Mobsters And How They Helped Us Win The War, is only of mild interest. I should have known that something was wrong when I looked at the author's pictures: a pair of unhappy collaborators if I ever saw one! I hate looking for another author! Come back! Please!"
2,GREAT BOOK....,"My five year old son loves trains and all the thomas books. This product is an excellent book, not only is it affordable but they are also learning from it. I would recommend it."
2,Beautiful Book,This was bought as a gift for a 9 year old boy. This story lets him know that not everyone is the same or should they be.
2,one of the best,"Lois Lowry is a great writer. Its a book you dont want to put down. If you think that the world we live in is bad you should read The Giver, cause they dont have all the things we have it has no color nothing you dont even get to have a opinion. If you read this book you will have a differnt perspective of our community. But one thing I didn't like about the book was the ending it should of told more at what happened to Jonas and Gabe."
2,A Realistic Utopia,"This book sets the stage for a utopian society, and it's very believable. Who's to say that this couldn't really happen sometime in the future? However, what I really liked about this book, is that once Jonas found himself, he wasn't afraid to take action and stand up for what he knew was right. Loved it. The first time I read it was the sixth grade, and I still enjoy it. It's one of my favorite books of all time, it's a relatively quick read for an adult, but it really makes you think."
2,An appropriately thought-provoking read for any age,"The beauty of this book is that it is pushing people to grapple with the ways that any society could limit itself to ignorance, while not actually pointing the finger of blame at any wizard behind the curtain. Not only is the story epic and brief, making it perfect for younger or simply impatient readers; but it is beautifully crafted. As you move from one line to the next, you will find it hard to foresee whether the next feeling it stirs within you will be shock, awe, comfort, disgust, and so on. This is a daring little story, aimed at the big enemy we could prove to be for ourselves. Buy one for everyone you know who isn't afraid to face the darkness with both eyes open!"
2,A look at what could happen to our world.,"I had heard about this book for years but I had never read it. People always talked about it like it was a forbidden fruit or a masterpiece. The question always was, ""Should children read this story?"" I finally had a chance to read it! I found the story to be very intriguing. It makes you think about the ""what ifs"" that could happen in our future. The author pulls you into Jonas's world by involving you in the memories that The Giver passes on to him. Children should be briefed on the story and its elements before reading this book. I think it would be appropriate for middle school children. A teacher from Michigan."
2,The Giver,"The book ""The Giver"" takes place in a strange community some time in the Future.Jonas is closing in on his ceremony of Twelve, when Elevens become Twelve's, sort of like what we call our birthdays. Every person who turns Twelve is assigned a job for the rest of his or her life, or until reaching the House of the Old. During the ceremony, something unexpected happens and Jonas has to take on a job that is deviant but very respected. Jonas soon learns why his community is based on rules; why some things are banned, but, there's an upside.My over all statement is that everyone should read this book.By:~*~*Emma E.~*~*"
1,"Rewiew of ""The Giver""","""The Giver"" is a novel which deals with the problems boy named Jonas who lives in a totalitarian system.I this system,the habitants are genetically manipulated so that they are not able to feel.Only the ""Receiver of Memories"" has feelings and Jonas is chosen to be the next one. In his assignement he is able to get to know the whole truth about their society which reveals enormous cruelties.The author employs the third- person-point of view but she stays close to the protagonist's perspective,so that the reader is able to identify with Jonas.The novel is easy to read and to understand because she often uses hypotaxes.In regard to the content and the action, the text is diaphonous and the characters do not have uncommon personalities.I think,the novel is approciated for younger people from about 10 to 14 years because the plot is often flat and ordinary. So in my opinion,the text does not belong to high-quality-literature."
2,a truely wonderful book...,"I recently read The Giver and i thought it was a wonderful book. I liked it because it was truley original and really made you think about things you might never have thought about before. Like, what it would be like to live in a Utopia-like world. Also, it really illistrates how nothing can be perfect--even such a seemingly perfect community has it's faults."
1,Just ok,"This book, The Giver, is written by the well known author Lois Lowry. She is a very talented author and has won many awards for this book. This book takes place in a ""perfect"" community. It is run by commity of elders. They make all the decisions for the community because they think that they will make the wrong decisions in life. When you become a nine, which is your age, you receive a bike. When you becaome a twelve you will receive an assignment which is just like yoiur job. Jonas is picked to be the receiver of memories which is a very honorable job. The giver must give the receiver the memories. Jonas gets all the feelings that he has never felt before. He desperately wants to see the real world. Overall this book was not to good. It was very hard to keep reading it."
2,The greatest novel,"Jonas lives in a perfect society. No pain, no color, and nolove. Jonas has to worry about turning twelve. When he finally does,he is chosen to perform a specific role in his ""Community"". Jonas has been selected to be Receiver of Memory. The Giver, the previous Receiver of Memory, has to pass on the memories of the whole world to Jonas.The Giver has enlightened me. Lois Lowry has taken true life and has molded it with fiction, to create the greatest story about utopia that I have ever read. She used descriptive characters and a great story line. This story will most likely stay with me for long time."
2,The Giver,"This book really made me think about the views on the future and how incredably imposible having a perfect world would be. The beginning of this book really opened my eyes to the exact set up Lois Lowry describes the future to be like. It made me think of how things would be if the world were completely orgagnized. But 12 year old Jonas had to take on the memory of the world, finding the real dirt at the core of this ""perfect"" society. Departure was out of the question in the role he was assigned, but with the help of his adviser, The Giver, he had an escape ahead."
2,Review for The Giver ( i guess uh.... one thumb up?),"This is a pretty good book. Our class of 7SR just finished it. i think Lois Lowry should write a sequel, because the ending is like so NOT clear to me and probably isn't for a lot of other people who read this book. Did anybody else in the world, besides my class, find like 1,000 sameness's for this book and ""I Am David"" by Anne Holm? well our class (of 7SR) would like to know if Lois Lowry borrowed any i deas from that book."
2,"You either like it or you don't, theres no inbetween","If I told you what happened in this book, it would ruin it for you. You have to be totally clueless to enjoy this book to the fullest, and I was. Just think of a world with no color or music or joy in general, and that world is suddenly overwhelmed by all of that. That has something to do with it. It is more of an adult book, but advanced kid readers can also read it, I did anyway. It has characters so real you can compare them to your friends and a world so unreal you couldn't even dream about it. I can't say anymore, but this book has few flaws and my friends ans I liked it. You will to, I hope."
1,Giver,I did not like this book very much because well it did not makesence to me because well it was not a good book. I would not reccomendit to anyone no matter what because well i think they will not like it. I did not like the ending it just ended and it did not make sence to me. I liked how they decribed the community and how they decribed the memories Jonas recived and the memories Giver had of his past and other things like that. I liked Asher Jonas's bestfriend and Fioena too and i liked how they decribed Gabe in the book and how they decribed Gabes eyes how Gabe looked a little like Jonas. The other characters in the book were Lilly and mother and father and the old people that Jonas knew and the commity of elders and every one that he knew.
2,Interesting point of view...,"I am a 30's something female just starting to read Lois Lowry again. This book gripped me and I could not put it down. It is so far fetched from society that I wanted to know what happened next. It is a neat story and I really enjoyed it. I did not like the way it ended, but you need to read her other book The Messenger when you are done."
1,The second chapter,"Hello ladys and gentleman,we are here to say to that the book is very boring for us.... We have read the first two chapters, and we don't understand the whole story...We don't like the story... it's boring. But if you like it it's ok... we see..."
1,DON'T READ THE GIVER,IT IS ABOUT A KID NAMED JONAS AND AN OLD GUY WHO GIVES JONAS BAD MEMORIES. THE ENDING IS SO WEIRD. THE BOOK MAKES YOU THINK TOO HARD. IT IS BAD.
2,THE GIVER,"Jonas is a kid who lives in the perfect world, nothing goes wrong there are rules about everything about how manny children per family about marrige and about your job. When the ceremony of twelves takes place.Jonas is selected as ""Receiver of Memory,"" the most important job in the community; he recieves the memoy of the past in which he finds wisdom. Nobody in the community has a memory of the past exept for the ""Reciever of Memory"" they don't have memory of snow or even color and they don't have feelings.""THEY KNOW NOTHING""As reciever of memory Jonas wants to change that. He and the Giver plot for Jonas to escape to Elsewhere where there are colors and feeling but also suffering. This will realease Jonas memory on his community undoing sameness.A great story yet with an unclear end. -m.b."
1,Not enough Detail,"Really most people would like this book, but personally I think the author didn't go into enough detail on how the society *It was a completely socialistic society* was created, how they made it so people couldn't see color, and other such things. It was creative, but not in very much detail, and I would recommend this to most people, but not to the one's like me who like to see how (In the writer's opinion) these things would be done."
1,THIS IS SICK!,"THIS BOOK IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT ANY CHILD SHOULD BE READING! I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO MY CHILD'S SCHOOL ABOUT THIS AND I PRAY THAT PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THIS BEFORE THEY LET THEIR CHILD READ IT! CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS' FATHER KILLED A BABY. THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TRASH AND THEN WE GIVE THIS BOOK TO OUR KIDS TO READ FOR A GRADE! IF YOU THINK THIS BOOK IS GOOD, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXAMINE YOURSELF. HOW COULD THIS HAVE WON AN NEWBERY AWARD! PLEASE, IF THERE ARE CHILDREN'S AUTHORS READING THIS, P L E A S E! WRITE SOME HAPPY AND ENCOURAGING STORIES FOR OUR KIDS TO READ AND ENJOY!"
2,The Giver is about a different kind of community.,"The Giver is a uniquely written book that is full of allusion and suspense in a twisted way. It is very touching in the fact that it opens your eyes to a community that shows equality for all. On the other hand, it is a rare calling to be the receiver of knowing everything, but it can also be harsh and emotional. It is something to live among others that are blinded to the hueful side of things. This is a wonderful book for people of all ages. I loved it completely."
2,The Best,"This book was amazing, It really gets u thinking, about the way we live in this world. And if there really is a perfect world. The end of the book is confusing, but u'll understand it. in your own way. I'd recomendthis book for anybody!"
2,I Enjoyed This,"Someone gave me this book after I told them how much I loved 'The Hunger Games.' It was an interesting read. It had hints of 'Brave New World,' and this not so perfect, 'perfect' community. It was definitely better than 'The Uglies,' which is also a YA sort of dark, future society. Out of this genre I would have to say that 'Hunger Games' and 'Logans Run' are my favorite, but 'The Giver' gave an interesting take on it, even if it was a little depressing. I would say this is probably a better message for kids to read than THG, though, not quite as much fun."
2,"To recomend or not to recomend ""The Giver"" that is the ?","Many people have read The Giver and have many thoughts regarding the book. Some would say that the novel interested them and kept them want to read. Many of the people that have read the book have written to the author which is, Lois Lowry, and told her if she would write a sequel. But she responded saying that the ending was up to the readers imagination. The book focused on the journey that Jonas took after he became Reciever of Memory. As Jonas' perfect life got turned upside down with reality the book showed his strength and wisdom conquering the new differences he came upon."
2,An Outstanding Book,"Not being an avid reader, I was drawn to the Giver more by its cover than by its reputation. However, having read the book, I would definitely say that it is extremely profound, and worthwile for everyone to read. I am disappointed to hear the bad reviews from younger readers of this book, and I am disappointed to hear that it is being used in younger curriculums, as I think the deeper meaning of the book is being lost. I am a fan of books that make you think and question, and if you enjoy authors like Vonnegut (my personal favorite) you should not pass over this book."
2,The Giver,"""The Giver"" is a story written by Lois Lowry that conveys what human life would be like if no thought or feelings were involved. Life just goes on as normal with people never asking any questions on why such activities are done the way they are in the town. The story begins to pick up when Jonas is selected as to be the Receiver of town (the most respected position). As this happens, a whole new story is unfolded to the reader.Overall, this is a wonderful story that brings the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions as Jonas begins to receive memories that everyone takes for granted. Due to the variety of emotions the reader feels, it becomes very hard to put the book down, because the reader feels the need to find out what happens to Jonas. This is a very good story that keeps the reader interested throughout the entire story and still keeps the reader wanting more at the end."
2,Very good book,I read this book to preview it before gifting it to my 12 year old nephew. I wanted to make sure it is appropriate for his age. I did not expect to get sucked into the story as much as I did. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only complaint is that the ending was rather abrupt and didn't really leave me with any sense of resolution.
2,thought-provoking,"The Giver is written in a unique style that gives much for the imagination to ponder. Lowry's descriptions are vague as well as the ending. However, I feel Lowry wants each reader to come away from the book with something personal so she leaves certain details open to interpretation.The plot is unique taking place in a perhaps futuristic world. The community in which the main character, Jonas, lives seems to be controlled by computers and other sophisticated technology. The people live simplistic lives, but Jonas will learn the secrets behind the community. He faces decisions that ultimately prove to be too much and he must leave the community. The ending is rivoting and readers will be moved and surprised by the ending."
2,Surface and Symbol,"From Oscar Wilde's Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray: ""Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.""A good pick for readers at both the middle-school level and the high school level, Lowry's prize-winning novel takes her audience beneath the surface of Jonas' world. When he begins to see beyond and beneath the perfect exterior of the Community, Jonas as well as the reader must make a difficult choice.This is a very good book to spark discussions about our society today, our future, and our choices. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially in a classroom setting. Lowry's gifts of characterization, symbolism, and emotion make this a truly great find."
2,This is a Great book.,I have read this book over and over agian because it will never be old. I read this book in the sixth grade and after we read it i knew i had to get my own copy. It was so good that used to be all i read until i read Lois Lowery's Gathering Blue. In my opinion everyone should own this book. It is the best book i have read and own. I recomend it to anyone.
2,Excellent Read,"Very enjoyable book fast paced and interesting well written, found it very difficult to put it down. Story is set in a futuristic society where 'sameness' has been favoured in terms of individuality but as a result there is littl place for deep feelings such as compassion and empathy and for those who don't fit or are surplus to requirement....."
2,A book for the mind.,"I read this book when I was in 7th grade and loved it! It's only my 2nd favorite, after ""The Outsiders"" by S. E. Hinton. Out of my whole class I was the only one who enjoyed it, the only one who understood it, and the only one who carried the meaning with them. It is most definitely a book for the mind. I read it over my Christmas holiday and realized I could hardly put it down, except to eat and sleep! I won't, I can't, tell you any more about the plot because it is something each individual needs to comprehend on their own or else it will mean nothing. I also found that there were parts I reread because it was just so incredible! My favorite aspect of ""The Giver"" is that the whole plot is set up with subtle little ""ties"" that will strike you wild when you connect them! I really recommend ""The Giver""."
2,Very quick and great read.,This is probably one of the books that I read through the fastest. It kept me interested throughout and was difficult to put down. This is one of the first books to ever make me keep reading so I could find out what happens next. I told myself I was only going to read one more chapter and ended up reading three more before going to bed. One of the great things about this book is that it is very short and very easy to read. This isn't one of my favorite books I have ever read but it was very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it.
1,The Giver,"This is a creepy, dystopian novel about a society that appears to be perfect but really isn't. How many of these have been written? I got a weird feeling when they talked about the pilot being released for an error- Wow. I could almost see the creepy smiles. MWAAAHAAHAA... I had to read this for English, and I have hated my teacher since for making me read this. This book just bored me to death, reading it was like pulling eyeteeth. Especially with all the memories. After a point, I didn't even care!! (I wonder, did I ever care? Probably not.) Their perfection also bored me. How monotonous. This was also really creepy, because they were going to kill an innocent baby just because he couldn't sleep!! The sled was also confusing... What the heck is so important about a sled? In short, a creepy book about a futuristic society that bored me to death. Please do not read for the sake of your sanity."
1,The Giver,"I do not think the book ""The Giver"" was a good book. I do not like how the community was controlled. The book takes place in the future but there technology is not any more advanced than today.It was odd how they released the elderly and the newborns.It was heartless how they released people.I thought it was wrong. It was a somewhat interesting book but I DO NOT recommend it."
1,How sad,My step daughter had to read this book for school. How sad that we give medals to books that have no message other than that of a liberal perfect world. I found this book very depressing and not edifiying in any way. My wife and I read the book and can't believe that there isnt't a more positive book that the schools can promote. How sad.
2,good review,"I gave this book 4 stars because of all the parts that I thought were the best parts in this book. I really recommend this book for people because of there was the best climax at the right moment in this book. I disliked that in this book everyone got there real jobs at only 12 years old. I also disliked the fact that people get ""released"" because I think they should have the elder people go threw old age without having to die early. At the end of the book Jonas and his little sister had escaped from the community and I thought that would be a good part in the book because they found out what it means to be released and they didn't want to be part of the community anymore so they had escaped."
2,Incredible!,"This is a really thought provoking book, and ventures into a realm that nearly everybody, secretly wants. It is very high-detailed, yet the plot reads extremely quickly. There is no fluff. The ending really made me think, and after I read it, I felt a renewed sense of appreciation for the world we live in. Read this. You won't regret it."
2,A Tale of Secret Memories,"In a community where people know nothing about real life, Jonas must learn the memories of humankind that have been hidden for generations. His simple, yet new and amazing, discoveries open his eyes to the miserable, opressive conditions under which people in his society live, and his relationship with the giver develops into a strong bond as the novel progresses.An excellent piece of juvenile literature, The Giver provides a warning for civilization not to become too ""civilized."""
2,The Giver - a book to remember,"I think that ""The Giver"" was a very good book. It was well written and had a good meaning. In this book, Jonas shows a lot of courage and determination. He does not leave just for himself and Gabe; he leaves for the whole community.Some examples of courage were when he decided to leave the community. He had left his dwelling at night, taken a new child and had stolen food from the community. He knew that if he was caught, he would be condemed. That showed a lot of courage.He also showed determination by not giving up. He could have turned back any time and went back to the community, but he was determined. He knew what he had to do. 7.3AAM"
1,"Read ""1984"" instead","Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a ""fleshing out"" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me."
2,Cliffhanger,"I loved this book! It was slightly creepy at some parts, but you have to accept that. It is incredibly well written. At the end of every chapter, there is a cliffhanger. I had the hardest time putting the book down! If you listen to Natalie Imbruglia's ""Torn"", it is basically a little summary of the song. Just thought you'd like to know that. :)"
2,KB Pope John XXIII,"When I first began the Giver, I was not entirely sure that I liked it. The Community was so orderly and repressed, not my usual type of story. However, by the time I was about halfway through, I had come to really like the story. Jonas, the lead character grows and matures, drawing in the audience in the process. The missing pieces fit together, and by the intriguing conclusion, the reader is sure to be rooting for Jonas. I recomend this to everyone, it is a really great book!"
2,The Giver,"I liked ""The Giver"", by Louis Lowry very much. I recomend it to everyone. It is about a perfect world where everyone is the same exept for Jonas, the main charecter. I liked the idea of a perfect world, but his was not perfect in my opinion. Jonas thinks outside the box and tries to understand the reality of his life. I think we as Americans should try to do this also. We thought that no one could harm us, and Jonas thought that his life would always be the same. We were wrong as was Jonas. If there ever is a sequal it will answer many questions."
2,Engrossing!,"I recently read this book for my middle school library college class and was completely engrossed! In high school my favorite book that the school made us read was 1984 and The Giver was very similiar.I remember when this book came out and I saw the cover and thought it was a ""boys book."" I didn't know what the big fuss was about and didn't want to read a book about an old man. I wish that I had looked past the cover and read then because I LOVED this book."
2,The Giver-Ending?What Ending?,"The Giver was a good book. When Jonas became Receiver, and everything leading up to it, it was good. Getting the memories-wonderful description. The great escape- a wonderful plot thickening twist. But when the ending came, I was so dissapointed, I could have thrown up. The ending left more questions unanswered than Full Disclosure. I hope that others can figure out what happens in the ending better than I can, because I want the satisfaction of closure over having to figure out (if it's possible) wha happens to our main character."
2,Engrossing,"Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion, an ordered community, ignorance of real life and where the word love is meaningless and you are in Jonas's world. This story makes you question whether or not you really want to live in that so-called perfect world. It also shows the horror of that perfect world. And when Jonas does begin to love he sets in motion events that can't be erased and are possibly devastating to the community.The second time that you read the novel, The Giver, by Lois Lowry the story and characters are even more real than they previously were and the story has so much more depth than before. This novel is not only a good read for younger kids, but also for teenagers and adults because there are things in the novel that everyone can relate to.~TA, Pembroke Academy"
1,ok,"The shipping was amazingly fast. However the book was listed as regular paperback and it was a mass market paperback. Also the pages are all so yellowed it's hard to read. Not what I would have called ""good condition."""
2,A wonderful book deserving of its award!,I rented the audiocassette to take on an 8 hour car trip. My husband and 11 year old son complained about having to listen to it--but were both saddened when it came to an end and wanted explanations! My 13 year old daughter and I loved it. I was so touched by Jonas strength and compassion for Gabe and I was so impressed by the ending of this story. I like it when the author leaves part of the story for the reader to figure out and think about. It is a sign of a good book if you have to actually go inside yourself for some of the answers.I thought about this book for days and was thorougly impressed with this newberry award winner.
2,Award winning book,An award winning book is a great thing to read. Have been meening to read this for quite a while.
2,The Giver,"Lois Lowry does a wonderful job creating a futuristic/utopian society. There is one person chosen in the society that has to hold all of the memories from the past. The chosen one is a 12 year old boy named Jonas. Once the Giver has successfully passed on all of the memories, Jonas alone will have all of the infomation from the past- good and bad. When Jonas starts to feel the true pains and pleasures in life there's no turning back. He has to make a decision based on his limited knowledge at the risk of hurting everyone in the society. Maybe living in a utopian society would be nice. Being told how and what to do at all times, but how do you deside who is in charge? Is it possible to let someone else controle your every move? This is the kind of society that Jonas has lived in for 12 years. How would you react if you suddenly had the freedom to think for yourself? You will have to read the book to find out what he decides."
2,Great book for young adults teens 13-19,"This book has the feeling to get into your mind of what it is mlike to die, what you feel when someone dies. It ios a great book to experince, that is why i like it, it has been the second best book i've ever read."
1,The Giver : A Weak Attempt at Allegory (with a Bad Ending),"The book was tollerable and even enjoyable until the conclusion. The book falls apart at the end. If you want a true, classic and socially enlightening book, then read THE SCARLET LETTER by Hawthorne. Lowry's weak attempts at making the boy Christlike include: a red apple (a color only seen by the boy), discovering christmas, and saving a baby from death. If you are looking for a happy ending, you'll have to fill in the blanks..."
2,Great book,I really liked this book. It is thought provoking and a great book for a book club to read. Generates lots of discussion!
1,Doesn't make any sense!!!,"I've read this book, and I didn't get one thing out of it. It is such a ridiculous idea that a world and its inhabitants do not have any feelings or memories. What a croc."
1,Not this Seaford Deader's favorite book,"The Giver was an odd book. The beginning was terrible but the middle and most of the end was interesting at times. At the end of each chapter something happened that made you want to read more. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who likes lots of action and thrills, because The Giver hardly had any. Also, if you don't like to think a lot while reading, this book is not for you. There are also a few deaths, so if you get upset easily don't read this."
2,The Giver is a great book!,"I rated this book a four star becease for me it is not perfect, but it's still really good. I liked how Jonas was different then everyone else in the community. I don't like when the Giver talks about Rosemary because to me it seems like the Giver only likes Rosemary and not Jonas ( it also just bothers me). I would definitly sugjest this book to any one."
2,The Giver,"WOW! I couldn't put this book down! When I was finished reading it, I was flipping the back pages, begging it to tell me more!!I have to know more about Jonas and Gabe!!I actually got on here to see if there's another book and YES there are two more, thank you! thank you!This is a story about what life would be like if it were perfect, I guess you could say. Everything is controlled and decided for you, to make your life the best for you and everyone else in your community.. but, is it really the best?This was so interesting and emotional for me, I will definetly be reading the next two!"
2,The Giver,"This book should be a ""must read"" for every young person particularly those whose life, thus far, is focused on the material ""rewards"" of life. The Giver can be humbling, uplifting plus a treatise on what our lives are really all about. Adults will find ""sage"" philosophies as wee."
2,Hey!,"Hey! look over here ok now that I've got your attention, if you're looking for a strange but good book then this is the perfect book for you. The Giver by Lois Lowry explains how the Giver gives Jonas thoughts and teaches him different feelings from everyone else. To start, Jonas lives in a very strange town. The community that he lives in is unusually different in its ways and rules. Also, in The Giver, he gives Jonas real thoughts and feelings. The feelings are happy, sad, and miserable. Finally, Jonas leaves the community. Unfortunately, if I tell you why it would ruin the whole story! So you better read this book to find out why Jonas ran away!"
2,My Son Loved this Book!,"My middle schooler had to read this book for class, he completed in 2 nights and wanted it to continue. Loved It!"
2,The Giver,"As a book of fiction The Giver is great. I find that because it shows you to be careful what you wish for. In The Giver the characters can't see any color or are unable to hear music. They have no freedom of choice in their world. All because some one made a wish and it came true. The part that effected me the most is reading about Jonas because he was the receiver of everyone's memories. He ends up receiving all their pain, but at the same time he also receives their beautiful memories at the same time. At the time the character Jonas is twelve years old so he's pretty young. In the end the decision that Jonas makes is important about himself but to find out about that you have to read the book. I think that if it left me feeling what if this really happened in our world, I think that you would wonder to."
1,Another Rom stereotype,"One illustration in this otherwise innocent tale clearly depicts Gypsies as ""wood people"" who, the text says, will ""take"" children if they wander into the forest. It is unfortunate to see such blatant stereotyping --- in an age when the Romany (Gypsy) population of Eastern Europe is the target of more hate crime than at any time since the Holocaust. It's too bad that so many children's authors remain completely insensitive to the slavery and poverty suffered by the Rom. Discerning readers can help by avoiding books that include any kind of sterotyping.---Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I thought this book would tell me something I didn't know. It didn't. I thought it would be interesting enough to keep me awake and wanting to read it. It wasn't. I thought Bruce Schnier was a big thinker and agressive. He isn't; he's overly cautious and careful with his words out of his own ""fear"" of insulting somebody. I thought he would take a stand on the issues. He didn't. I thought he understood security in the post-9/11 world. He doesn't. In fact, this book was written like 9/11 never happened and as if our terrorist enemies are mindless idiots.If you want a good overview of the strategic issues facing cyber security and homeland security, read Dan Verton's Black Ice. That offers a far better understanding and overview of what's going right and what's going wrong in homeland security and cyber security, because Verton isn't afraid. Scnhier hasn't found a way to go beyond his own fear."
2,Blast from the past,"This is a classic 1980's video. It was great when it came out, and it stands the test of time today. If you want a throwback to some 80's nostalgia, watch this film!"
2,An 80's Classic!!!,"I've always loved time travel movies, and it had been a long time since I watched this, so I decided to refresh my memory. This movie is very funny about two dim-witted friends named Bill and Ted who are close to failing their history class. A man from the future named Rufus gives them a Phone Booth Time Machine and they travel all throughout time and collect Billy the Kid, Socrates, Sigmund Freud, Beethoven, Joan of Arc, and Abraham Lincoln and bring them to their time to help them with their report. If you love comedy, the 80's, and time travel, you'll love BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE!!!"
2,Dudes! You Guys Are Going Back in Time With This Movie.,"If you want to see a funny time machine movie, this is the one! It is set up with great characters and great scenes for each time period! I like this movie because there is not as much cursing as there is in some other movies, and it doesn't have violent scenes.This is the most triumphant video! (Even without Eddie Van Halin)!"
2,Excellent!,"Eighties movies do NOT get any better than Bill and Ted! This movie rocks in all concieveable ways, and in ways few have dared ever repeat. This is excellent, but the lack of extras is non-non-heinous."
2,Will last for months,"Yep, my dogs chew the heck out of these but I know from past experience it will last for a couple months before I need to replace."
2,good quality product typical of OXO,"This is a really nice set of measuring spoons. They are aesthetically pleasing, well-made, and ergonomically sound. They have been through my dishwasher about ten times already, and there are no signs of wear as of yet. I could see how the writing might eventually wear off, so it would be nice to have raised lettering (even though with only four sizes, they are easily distinguishable). Also, it would be nice if they expanded the set to at least include 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 tablespoon. Overall, a very good set of spoons, and another quality OXO product."
2,"Good features, works well","Nice features: the clip onto the ring holds when it should, releases when it should. Distance from where the rubber part ends to the spoon bowls is well thought out, enough grip, yet enough metal flat area to scrape against a jar top."
1,"Not worth it, get metal...","In just a short time, even by only hand washing, expect all the labels to be barely readable. It's just not worth it. I got an all metal set with etched in numbers and it has worked beautifully with no wear. These plastic ones were allocated to my son's play kitchen."
2,Great measuring spoon set,I bought these for my sister as a Christmas gift. I liked that the set included 6 spoons (including the 1/8 tsp).
1,"Labels rub off very quickly, and made of plastic.","We are trying to rid our lives of all plastic, whether BPA-free or not, but bought these well before that change. They seem kind of cheap, but do function ok, which is why I gave them two stars instead of one.THE LABELS WEAR OFF EVEN AFTER A FEW GENTLE HAND WASHINGS. I never sent them through the dishwasher, and was careful not to scrub the size labels at all, to no avail.I would spend 5 more dollars and get some stainless steel ones. In fact, try to convert all your kitchenware into Pyrex glass, stainless steel, and bamboo. You won't regret the quality or the health benefits."
2,Lil LOVES Lotty!,"Santa brought our (then) 5 month old Lotty for Christmas. She absolutely LOVES Lotty! The antennae must be magical because that's the first thing she reached for and of course put in her mouth. Even when she's fussy, you can put Lotty on her tummy and give her kisses and she smiles and grabs the antennae and starts to play. She also likes to look at herself in the mirror on Lotty's tummy. I would definitely recommend Lotty to anyone looking for a lovable and entertaining toy."
1,Much ado about nothing,"Marina loves Sebastian - no, wait, she's determined not to be attracted to him because she's got to marry Don Felipe to save her family. Sebastian loves Marina - no, wait, he's determined to be only sexually attracted to her, and takes revenge on her because she scarred his face with her ring when she (justifibly) fought off his potential rape.And oh, there's Marina's cousin Carmen flaunting herself around too, but, no, wait, Carmen's secretly in love with Marina's brother, who's missing in the Caribbean, but no, he's not missing after all and turns up just in time to think Sebastian is Carmen's lover...oh, what a mess!And actually a big boring mess at that."
1,WORST soundtrack ever,"this has to be the worst soundtrack ever. most of mtv's soundtracks aren't very good, but this is the worst. i highly reccomend you NOT waste your money on this, even if your a fan of the show like i am."
2,a good turner,My husband likes it. We have no complaint about it. I think it will last very long time. It's a good quality turner.
2,Spatula that you'll adore.,Another fine product by Oxo Good Grips. Good value for a sturdy spatula that will not bend out of shape. Love the comfy grip too.
2,Turner,"Perfect size and weight, just exactly what I was looking for. They are firm enough that there is little bend, not limp and cheap feeling."
2,"Sad, uplifting, and everything in between.","Morrissey's 1991 re-recording of his 1984 first album, Bill Morrissey captures the vulnerability and the hillarity of the artist. There is something for everyone on this disc, from the funny and hopeful ""Darlin Lisa"" to the bleakly troubling ""Rosie"". The album captures what Folk music is all about - life."
2,Chekov ... photon torpedoes fire!,The beginning of the Third Season was really good. This episode is no exception. The battle scene was one of the series finest. You then have Kirk and Elaan ending their fling in order to do their duties and responsibilities. This is a nice little episode.
2,"Love, by far, is wonderful","When i read most romance novels, the characters meet up in just the first chapter in almost a hurry and rushing way. Thats really ridiculous because you don't meet your soulmate just like that you know. You do something and then meet. Kerry is a perfect example of a brave and courageous woman who deserved to be looked up to. Her fabulous lover is kind and doesn't demand control so often. Together, they make such a great couple and makes me think that love is wonderful. Before that, i had the opposite view on love and now that i think of it, i feel that all of us need love. This world, needs love not 'world peace'."
2,An inspiring album from an inspiring man. . .,"Andrea Bocelli is not and never will be Pavarotti, or Domingo. This is not a problem. (I'll never play golf like Jack Nicklaus!) The passion in his music is unmistakable and penetrating. The love he holds for his faith and his music surges through every number on this album. One can only admire Bocelli's courage in overcoming his handicap in such magnificant fashion.This album brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. Those music critics who merely point out Bocelli's flaws need to listen with their heart as well as with their ears."
1,Very Traditional Roman Catholic renditions of religious arias.,"This is a VERY traditional Roman Catholic CD, for, like, Latin Mass lovers, so be aware of that. Amazon carries another, better, edition of this CD which you should check out before you buy this one:Sacred Arias [Special Edition with Bonus DVD] The Ave Maria is especially moving."
2,He is getting better with each recording.,"Bocelli shows his spritual side in this CD. The work is different here than on ""SOGNO and ""ROMANZA"", but he is going a diferent way. It kind of compares to his ""Opera Aria"" CD, but this has a different flavor to it. With Bocelli's voice and Chungs direction, this CD is very uplifting. And just in time for the holiday season. His voice can bring out the tenderness, the compassion, the spritual tones, that want you just to kick back , close your eyes and listen, take in everything that he is bring to you. Like he is singing just to you. So what if it is in Italian? All the better!Looking forward to more of his works."
2,Pretty good,"Pretty good book to learn from. Well laid out. Some areas could be clearer, but will use often!"
2,A good first book about scalable applications,"This book covers all the process to make a scalable application in .net world. It explains all about software and hardware issues. It is written in a easy English and the examples are in VB.net (I had preferred in C#). It covers lots of things in .net: objects, Enterprise Library, COM+, SOA, SQL Server, IIS, Clustering and NLB, W2000 and W2003 server... At the beginning of the chapters it introduces a little theory about the content, and later it goes to develop in .net.The language chosen for the examples and not going too deeply in some issues, like SOA, is just what i can say bad about it. And perhaps it shouldn't have been titled as 2.0. I miss that they haven't talk about some 2.0 features and develop in a 1.1 way.I should definitely recommend it."
2,A good book to have.,"A realize early that the book has potential.The content of the chapters are of high quality, even if I as a developer sometimes wanted more of the technical stuff (who doesn't ;-)?)But since the goal for the book is to focus on the whole picture and ties the hardware and the software design together in an easy understandable way I can highly recommend this book.I especially like the chapters about databases and the web service that described how to use the WSE kit from Microsoft in an easy manner. Thanks guys for the book!"
1,EDITION IS PROBLEMATIC,While the product arrived on time and in excellent condition the actual edition of the book is a terrible choice. Not only were there an outrageous amount of typos but some of the pages were actual reprints of previous pages. This made it a difficult text to read.
2,A most enjoyable reading experience,"I've been reading some of the Cather books and have enjoyed all of them. The best part of this book is her story within a story technique. Her descriptions of the American southwest are outstanding. This book held my attention, especially as it progressed. It is not as good as ""My Antonia"", which to me is her all time best, but it is an excellent reading experience."
2,good,muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
2,I like all of the Clarks shoes I have ever worn.,I ordered this as a replacement for a pair I wore out. It took me several years to go through the first pair. These feel good but may not be as sturdy as my old ones. I'm going to give them a few miles test walk then may go up to the 5 stars.
2,la marca lo dice todo,"son excelentes, còmodos y de gran uso. dese que los tengo los uso casi siempe y estan como nuevos, sobretodo la zuela"
2,A superb reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars.,"This band certainly appears to be a reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars (it features most of the legendary musicians who were key players in the 1960s Allegre sessions). Featuring the late great sonero Chivirico Davila and Paquito Guzman on vocals with a killer rhythm section this is smokin' classic ""Salsa Dura"" at its glorious best. Buy this CD now if you are a fan of 1960s and '70s Salsa. You'll love it!!!"
1,"Two units, two failures","I'd be happy with this cleaner if only it didn't cease to function. The first lasted under three weeks of thrice-weekly use. The seller replaced the unit and the replacement lasted about 6 months.The failure mode is like this: the unit works normally for a period of time between say 1 second and 2 minutes. Then 5 is added to the timer several times until the value on the display is over 20 and the unit switches itself off. So it seems like the controller is going crazy. No matter, the cleaner is useless to me."
2,UNADULTERATED SOUL AT IT'S BEST!,"THIS IS A ""MUST HAVE"" CD FOR EVERY STYLISTICS FAN. MY FAVORITE TRACKS INCLUDE COULD THIS BE THE END, LOVE COMES EASY, MAKE IT LAST, AND THE SMOOTH AND POWERFUL PAY BACK IS A DOG. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD IN YOUR COLLECTION, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET IT NOW! YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID."
2,Morning Magic,"I include Royal Jelly in my morning protein shake. This supplement provides a subtle boost to my energy, alertness and general well-being. Best if used daily."
1,Useless Fork,"If someone could please tell what this is useful for, I'd be grateful. It doesn't even deserve one star."
2,Always good,"Second season of NCIS LA is as good as the first one.As we already liked very much NCIS (very big success in France, second only to House M.D), the spinoff pleases us the same way as the East Coast serie.The only thing I regret : on the West Coast, Gibbs is not giving claps with his hand on his team's heads. The humorous Hetty replaces him as she can !I add for foreigners like me, that there is a great improvement in the second season for languages : we can see all episodes spoken in the original English, and French subtitled (or two other languages for subtitles). In the first season , zone 1, we had to listen the episodes in French language or in English but without subtitles.Purchases highly recommended."
2,Grim Reality plus Historical Accuracy,"The boxed set related to us everything we ever wanted to know about the Mafia. Unlike The Godfather, which has it's grim moments, these men were heartless except towards their immediate families, and at times they were not even safe. They were loyal to a fault; they were evil personified! If you want to know everything, buy the boxed set!"
1,"great show, poor HDTV playback","Fans of the first season will not be disappointed with the story content here--BUT, after having purchased SEASON ONE and being very satisfied with the DVD quality on my 50"" HDTV, SEASON 2 is a major disappointment in its picture playback quality. Jagged fuzzy edges abound on my 50"" and my 42"" TVs( although the smaller set is a bit more watchable because the pixels are obviously tighter meaning that if you have a 32"" or smaller set it may not necessarily bother you) It does play fine on my one remaining picture tube TV which obviously means the Season 2 DVD set was NOT manufactured for HDTVs as opposed to its predecessor. Too bad--it will make me think twice about buying SEASON 3 ( or any other new CBS-TV DVD sets) until I hear or read other reviews."
2,good spaghetti server,the item arrived quickly and was well packaged. The item appears very sturdy and i expect it will last a long time
1,Oh well...,i should of listened. i would give the free ride a 2 out of 5 and the story mode a 3 1/2. its not as good as i expected. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! especially if your a kid who rarely gets money and rarely buys games. save your money and reserve a copy of grand theft auto san andreas. Never before have i ever been more anxious about a game more than grand theft auto and it has always been as good as i expected. read more about my review on grand theft auto san andreas titled i cant wait by jacob from somewhere.
1,"No coupons included (as author suggested) and weak info, some plagarisms on camoflage","The author claimed there are coupons, I did buy it used, but no coupons were included. The section on camoflage was almost Identical to another book by another author (It was either blackjack secrets by Wong or Turning the tables by anderson)I wouldnt waste my time with this book. American Casino guide has the best coupons for the money. Second place is Las Vegas advisor, which is included in a $37 subscription. If they sold the book for $15, i'd buy it.Million dollar Blackjack, Turning the tables on Las Vegas, the Video ""Blackjack science"", shuffle tracking cookbook are the best. Beyond counting is great if you can find it for less than ten times the retail price. Blackjack Secrets and Professional Blackjack by stanford Wong are almost the same book. A few differences. Knockout blackjack, Caro's book of tells and blackjack blackbelt are a waste of money."
1,Follow at your peril,"This is an entertaining read and almost certainly the most comprehensive work on the subject. But the fundamental premise (basically: the casinos will do anything to screw you out of your money, so here's how to sink to their level) is not only self-demeaning (who could consider days spent trying to weasel their way into a crummy buffet a vacation anyway?), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms. As some other reviewers here have correctly pointed out, one bad streak at the tables will completely wipe out whatever paltry ""gains"" the comp-grubber may have nickel-and-dimed their way into. Consequently, this book could be likened to an auto repair manual that destroys your car engine if you follow its instructions. Buyer beware."
2,Great game,It arrived as described and i haven't had any issues with it. I would recommend this item to anyone without hesitation.
2,This is simply a wonderful album,"The quality of the songwriting on this album is just breathtaking, with Elton John and Bernie Taupin at the height of their powers. A real treat for those who have followed Elton from his later classics like ""Don't Shoot me..."", or ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"". The further you go back in the Elton John catalogue, the more you realise just how talented a songwriting team John & Taupin are. The added value now is that each album has been digitally remastered, giving a fresher, cleaner sound. I can't recommend this recording highly enough; it should have a place in everyone's CD collection."
2,review,"product was fine. HOWEVER I will not buy from this vendor again as bought 2 cds, both were sent in the same envelope but I was charged with 2 handling /Shipping chrgs. I questioned this practice and was advsed by vendor I was charged this basically because he could."
1,"Tai chi beginning practice, David-Dorian Ross","This was a total waste of money! A lot of Yadda yadda, blah, blah, blah!!! In other words, NO EXERCISE, just talk. I got the DVD to EXERCISE!!! For preaching, I go to Church!!Awful, awful, awful. I got more actual practice from the PBS program, although D-D R, sure talked a LOT then too!I had to rate at least 1 star, but actually, I'd give it ZERO Stars."
1,Tai chi,I found it very hard to follow as he does not turn away from you. I will try it again but now I would not recommend it to others
1,I find this presenter hard to follow.,"I have several T'ai Chi dvds and truly enjoy the practice. I found this presenter hard to follow, and had I realized he was the the presenter on the dvd, would not have purchased it. There are other presenters out there who are a lot easier to follow and present in a way that I can truly understand and learn from."
2,An excellent introduction to tai chi,"After reading some of the more negative reviews I just want to point out that this DVD is not meant for you to build your tai chi vocabulary. Instead it's aim is to focus you on the basics of tai chi, breathing and learning the proper posture to relax yourself and open your meridians.For those who may find it frustrating, I can understand what you mean. But you just have to stop worrying about doing it and go along with the video. After a few tries you will have picked it up no problem.As for how I view the product, it does exactly what it sets out to do. It introduces you to the basic concepts of movement and provides for a greater foundation for tai chi later on. I started on this DVD and now am in advanced classes. My children now use this video (ages 3,4,6) and find it simple to use with mommy's guidance. Highly recommended."
1,Audio missing. Please fix.,Audio missing. Please fix. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Mary had a little lamb.Jack be nimble jack be quick.
2,Very good for fans of instrumental rock,"This is a good band from Holland that is a footnote in the history of late 60s - early 70s rock and roll. Only one song, the title track, has lyrics (although there are vocal parts on some other tracks, most notably the yodelling on Hocus Pocus). The final track, Eruption, takes up the entire 2nd side on vinyl and reminds me at times of Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick. While certainly not among the greatest works of all time, this is a good album and I recommend it for those looking for something with that 'classic rock' feel, but which hasn't been played to death on radio."
2,pretty short but nice read,It gives another look at shrooms and growing them. It's pretty nice how the meaning is described; and the illustrations on the cover are pretty trippy on their own.
1,well for begin,it's a good book for people who want to know the simplest method for growing the mushrooms. it's only dedicate to Stropharia cubensis.
1,OUT OF DATE N A RIP OFF,I purchased this item and to my surprise it was horrible. All the hype associated with it. Then when trying to get a refund because the item was so out of date I got nothing back. It is a rip off folks. Most of the information on this is incorrect. The websites dont exist and half the clubs listed in the venues directory have been closed to date. This book is close to 3 years old and is tauted as being updated. It is not true. Save your money and find other means....
1,COME ON...Forty BUCKS?!?!?,"There's little more to say....great item, almost a ""must have"", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal."
1,Canon Lens Hood EW83E,"It's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens, unfortunately Canon take advantage of this desire and exploit their loyal customers with over priced bits of black plastic, this is one of those bits of black plastic that you will want but should never have to feel so ripped off when obtaining it. It fits very well,looks good, has a nice furry inner surface, but I suspect that it's shallow profile means that it will afford little if any benefit to the performance of the lens."
2,Works like a charm!,"We do not have pie very often, but when we do it works great. Just right and can be used in other applications as well."
1,what,wow 5 episodes? and the packaging.. isnt even the same as the first season.. why are they shorting us with these?i couldnt imagine the 2nd season actually being only 5 episodes.
1,Not particularly interesting,"eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. Collection of short stories featuring mostly family events.While some of the stories had mildly amusing endings, none were particularly interesting. I got halfway through, thinking there would surely be a gripping storyline in here somewhere. There wasn't, and I quit. The title had NO connection to anything in the book. There were some minor spelling/grammar errors but nothing major."
2,Watch the wiring,"The plug was exactly what I wanted. BUT, when I hooked the plug up it flipped the breaker. I found that the factory had missed marked the positive and negative poles. The black screw indicates the hot and they had it on the ground side. As soon as I reversed the wires, it worked correctly."
1,Sad!,"I'm so sad about this book. I was really looking forward to reading it. However, the writing was so distracting because of incomplete sentences and poor punctuation, I could not get thru the first chapter. This obviously British author either tried to reinvent proper English (mistaking it for his 'literary style', or he never bothered learning it in the first place! I wish I could have gotten further into the story to at least be able to comment on it, but his grammar style was just too distracting. Needless to say, I am just happy I didn't spend good money for this book."
1,Pointless,"A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he ""took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done"". It nearly sent me to sleep."
1,George Soros' wet dream,"I love several of HG Wells novels. The First Men in the Moon, the War in the Air, the Time Machine are some of my favorite literary works. Unfortunately, many of his later works were full of Fabian Socialist Utopian ideas that essentially say if the stupid masses would just get out of the way and the ""right people"" were to make decisions for everyone, the world would be a great place. Of course, in novels, these people never want anything but the greater good. Of course, in reality, everyone who espouses these ideals, such as the aforementioned Soros, really want wealth and power for themselves. As a result, this is a simpleminded and boring approach to a future history novel. If it weren't written by HG Wells, probably no one would pick it up. While the movie made from this book, ""Things to Come"", is worth watching, don't waste your time with this preachy and silly book."
2,CHEVERISIMA,"ESTA CAMISA AL IGUAL QUE OTRA CAMISA QUE ME LAS TRAJE,SON CHEVERISIMAS,COLORES LINDOS,PRECIOS BUENOS,IGUAL LOS PUEDES UTILIZAR CON UNOS JEANS O CON UNA ROPA FORMAL..RECOMENDADA.."
1,not even worth the shipping,"I used this out in the back yard to create a nice shady spot for my 6 month old. One little whisper of wind, it was knocked over and one of the metal frames broke. It lasted less than 2 weeks!"
2,Excellent!!!!,"buy this tent for my son and loved it, is excellent material and durable, they can buy it for the beach but also for interior cool as it is a little warm, but a very good material is complete"
1,All that glitters isn't gold,"I bought this to go to the beach, it doesn't have anyway to anchor it, so we had to use sand to try to complete the task. However, when a slight wind would blow, down went the tent. I would say that this should be rated for indoor play only. Too bad they didn't test this on the beach, then they could have advertised it properly, rather than showing it with two little kids sitting in it, on the beach."
1,Disappointed,After reading many reviews I chose this tent to bring to the beach for my 7 month old. After putting it up there was no way I'd put my daughter in there. There was no air inside the tent and it was so hot inside I probably could have fried an egg. This tent was definitely not made for hot days at the beach!
2,Great Indoor Tent,"We got this tent for our daughters, age 2 1/2. They play in it every day for several hours. This goes well with their play kitchen. I put a blanket at the bottom and they love playing their toys in the tent. The size fits both of them comfortably. It also has the front zipper that can be closed completely and my girls love that feature. The tent is 40 inches tall so they can stand up at the middle of the tent. We placed it in our living room and it works out great. The materials are nice. The structure is sturdy for an indoor use. I don't think this will work well outdoor as it only has one small sand pocket on each side of the tent. It won't be enough to hold down the tent if it's windy outside."
2,Just stating the obvious,"In my honest opinion, this movie was the best film I've seen to date. First, the plot was excellent - (to those who have the intelligence to understand it). Second, this film flowed together pretty good, with the exception of the editing of the script to cater to those who wouldn't understand that it wouldn't just be 123 Laws (Jet Li's character) it would be almost a infinite amount of Laws and universes. Every time you make a yes/no or any descision would create a parallel universe. Just like for every action there is a reaction, every descision or choice has to be played out in both directions. Balance.Last, the making of The One was very cool, they made the super fast punches and kicks look so realistic.I hope they make another film of this genre!"
2,"Not the Best Jet Li, But Still Good.","Although I like Jet Li's older films much better, The One was still great, especially for one of his first major roles in an English speaking film (Romeo Must Die was first, but it was nowhere near as dialog intensive for Jet as The One).This film could have stood to be a bit longer. Less than an hour and a half long, another 10 or 20 minutes giving a little more depth to the characters would have been nice. What would have been nice is maybe a little bit more of the Multiverse. As the movie stands you only see 5 of the infinate number of universes, it only took Law 2 years to eliminate 123 targets, maybe seeing more than just his last target would have been nice.All in all a good movie (albeit short), and a must see for anyone as hooked on Jet Li films as I have apparently become over the past few months."
1,"Rent, don't buy...","I guess I was looking for a movie to pass the time... What I ended up doing was reading a magazine while half-watching/listening to this movie. The plot is rather unbelieveable even for sci-fi... Not consistent sci-fi. The acting is terrible... I was very dissappointed with Jason Stratham's performance after seeing him in Snatch. Jet Li should stick to martial arts, and not acting... I'm not a fan of Jet Li per se, but I do like good action. Some of the special effect fight scenes were great, and makes me recommend this for a rental... Or if you're really into Jet Li movies. Otherwise keep this ONE off your list. Seemed like it was too much of a ""promotion"" movie... Promote Jet Li since he's at a high point, Promote ""the next matrix"" style effects, and to promote ""Disturbed's"" new album. Just my two cents."
1,grade A bullflop,"The Only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because there is no option to give it none. I beg you, don't waste your time on this sad excuse for a movie. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, and horrible story. The idea of the multiverse is a good one, but this movie did not come up with that concept, and every aspect of this movie is a mockery of it. To me, this movie had no redeeming qualities, and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
2,The One,This film shows Jet Li at his best. Playing duo roles and playing them so real is truly amazing. Jason Statham is also in this one so it is a double treat for me.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR PETS!!!,"This product contains CORN SYRUP. I have been adding glucosamine to my dog's food for the past three years and never before have I purchased a product containing corn syrup. I avoid this unnecessary additive in my own food, and would never expect to find it in a health product for pets. The industry is in serious need of regulation!!!"
1,Could be Much Better,"I am the happy owner of a Kitchenaid stand mixer and food processor (they work perfectly). I bought this item based on my usual terrific experience with Kitchenaid - WRONG. Though its clean-up is a breeze (its dishwasher safe), its use is frustrating because all the coffee grounds leak out of the grinder. Clearly the great engineering design that went into their other products was not used here. However, I have discovered that a small amount of plastic cling-wrap placed on the grinder BEFORE the clear plastic cover goes on works wonders and prevents any spills from forming. Also, I do not overfill the grinder past the max. fill line in the cup, which, based on my Kitchenaid experience and its reputation, means it should not overflow."
1,"effective, but messy","I have three other Kitchenaid appliances... a stand mixer, a food processor, and a stick blender. I purchased this because I had high expectations from the Kitchenaid brand name. I intended to use it to grind spices. Although it does grind very well, it makes a small mess. I ground cinnamon sticks into a medium fine powder. Some of the powder escaped through a gap between the lid and the base, coating the grinder and the counter. The good news is all this can easily be cleaned up. The bowl disconnects from the base so you can wash it. I cleaned the dust off the base with a pastry brush. Bottom line, this will do the job, but there are probably other units that will do it better (or cleaner)."
2,NCIS eighth season,It appeared to be more complex and held my attention better. Tony seemed to mature a little and after all these years he should get rid of some of the nonsense. Overall I liked it very much.
2,Best series on TV,I have all eight seasons and have enjoyed them several times. By owning the DVDs you don't have to watch the commercials. The bonus features is also a plus.
2,ncis,This was the perfect Christmas present for my nephew.he is thrilled with gift which makes me thrilled to have got it
2,NCIS Season 5-8,Ordered NCIS seasons 5-8 and was very happy. Seasons 5-7 arrived unblimished and very fast. Season 8 arrived two days earlier than expected. I am VERY happy with the items and thankful that they arrived in pristine condition. Recommend all for anyone looking to complete thier set.
2,No set is complete without it,"My wife couldn't wait to open this up and watch the past episodes again, this crew never fails to deliver and it is our favorite show"
1,You'll learn Flash alright....but it'll bore you to death!!,"It's very educational but the contents...yuck. I want a book to INSPIRE me to USE the program i'm learning, this book has text that'll put you to SLEEP and illustrations a five-year old could have done better. The only thing that keeps me from giving it an ""ABSOLUTE SUCKS"" review is that you ACTUALLY(!) learn from this book, so if you buy this you'd better be stubborn about learning Flash, otherwise i'd wait until a better, more creatively inspiring book comes along. Learning: 4 stars, Fun: 1 star"
1,Dino Thunder Sleeping Bag,"My son loved the idea of a sleeping bag but it's not very comfortable. The fabric is very slippery on the outside and sticky on the inside. His pajamas stick to the fabric when he tries to roll over and the whole thing twists around him. He likes to play in it but not sleep in it. A good ""toy"" but not very practical."
1,learning remote,"good product, however it does not work with all TV's, I have a Sylvania and an Emerson, both digital tv's and this remote will not work with either one of them."
1,very boomy,"not a quality piece. i usually like KLH products, but this is definitely a case where you get what you pay for.the sound is loud, but very boomy and not controllable at all. i played around with it for a few hours and had to take it back - it was worthless to me. and i'm not an audiophile.i eventually bought a jbl PB10 and it's considerably better. it's twice the price, but worth it for the improvement in sound.best of luck!"
2,Good product,This is my first coffee grinder; it works very quickly and cleans up easily. I like that it's dishwasher-safe!To agree with a previous reviewer - I also grind beans for less than the recommended time.
2,KitchenAid Coffee Grinder Eval,"After wearing out several low cost units by makers, such as Black and Decker, etc. I opted to pay a bit more and purchase a heavy duty type. The KitchenAid unit is well suited for daily use. I really appreciate the fact that the grinder bowl separates from the power base, similar to a blender, so that you can dump the grounds without having to unplug the unit.The thick plastic cover/dome reduces the sound from the grinding somewhat which my pets appreciate.The power of the KitchenAid unit is great and I don't anticipate wearing out the motor, as I did in the B&D; unit.Overall, this unit is well worth the additional cost, plus if you have other KitchenAid devices, matching form factors is a nicety."
2,Works Great,"I have the Cobalt Blue i bought 3 years ago and use for spices. It does a great job on pepper and other whole spices like allspice. Yes it does overflow the rim but like someone said just invert before opening and everything will fall into the over sized plastic cap. Since it's stainless you can grind spices, rinse, wipe and do coffee with no flavor mixing. Since it's Kitchenaid you have no worries they stand behind everything they sell."
1,Mess Maker,"My wife must have nearly one of every red Kitchen Aid products. All function will and are built to last. But the only one to make a bigger mess on my counter is the stand mixer when it has too much flour and is run on high. I grind 1/4c. beans and it escapes either during the grind if I don't have the lid fully pressed or when I release the lid. This beauty is built to last and does look good on the counter. My last Starbucks grinder failed because of a frayed cord(from wrappping around the cylinder). The Kitchen Aid grinder has a high quality cord like my Porter Cable tools. Unfortunately it will last forever. Messy, messy, messy."
1,un- kitchen aid,"Got this today and reviewer who said ""coffee grinds all over counter "" is correct. Even under the first line for fill guidelines; less than 4 cups; I had grinds on the counter and on the side of the unit. Also, removable bowl is not very easy to remove; and requires tweaking to re seat. Very poor design; sorry kitchen aid; don't want to clean my counter and grinder every time I use it. This unit going back."
2,Very pleased....so far.,Very pleased thus far. Ability to wash grinding parts was the deciding factor in choosing this over other makes. The only reason I am only giving four (4) stars is that I have had it less than one month and cannot comment on its durability.
2,Edited From the LP,"As I see it, there are two ways of approaching this review. On the one hand, this CD is a great deal. Lots of great R&B by a great live band for an insanely low price. They tear through their own hits, as well as a great Sam Cooke medley (although I've always considered medleys a bit of a tease), followed by Cooke's ""Bring It On Home"" & ""Having a Party"" in their entirety, & finally Chuck Berry's ""Back in the USA"". On the other hand, as I looked at the set list, I thought I remembered ""Stagger Lee"" being on the original LP version. How they could edit out ""Stagger Lee"" (of all tunes), especially a 7+ minute version, is beyond me. As far as I'm concerned, this easily warrants taking a full point off. Bottom Line; If you like great live R&B, you can't go wrong with this. But it could've been so much better!"
2,Gutsy book,"This is a gutsy book by a gutsy woman. As C. Everett Koop, M.D. noted in the Foreword, it reads almost like a diary. The writing style is Grandma Moses in literary form. It flows effortlessly from one chapter to another, chronicaling the life of an unloved child who matter-of-factly trudges onward and upward. It's also a touching love story along the way. I found the description of how she dealt with her alcoholism enlightening and believe it will give hope to the women battling this devastating disease."
2,Very good but not great,"Based on the blink-182 pedigree of the band's key members, my expectations were very high for the first release by +44. After several plays, ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"" didn't meet the level of what I had hoped +44 would produce. It's certainly worthwhile to buy and there is a recognizable progression from the final blink CD, but there just doesn't seem to be anything noteworthy on it that stands out."
1,Expected More,"I was so excited to receive this video. I NEVER buy videos because I'm not one to watch them over and over however, I thought this would be great to share with family and friends. Like others have said there is only ONE really good pop out. Granted the scenary is great and has several greath depth pieces.I hope someday they can make GREAT 3D's with lots of popouts. That's what makes the show.Also the price is too expensive for less then an hour video."
2,Under the sea,Great dvd. Bought it for my 4 year old who watches it over and over. It is fast paced enough to keep him interested but calming at the same time.
1,Didn't get to watch it.,"We weren't able to watch it, because we don't have a 3-D T.V. I thought 3-D glasses would work. but they don't."
1,Shady practices - seller abundatrade,"Purchased this ""combo"". The seller (abundatrade) only shipped the 3D version and covered-up the UPC area where the manufacturer had printed ""NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE"". I assume this is because the discs were part of a combo pack as is the case with other combos I have purchased. Buyer beware when purchasing from this merchant."
2,Scarecrow Love Bites Fangs,"These fangs are great! I got these small ones and they were almost too big for my teeth but they looked better after I molded them. They were easy to customize and stay on wonderfully. I would highly recommend these, they are very realistic looking."
2,many compliments,"I was a vampire this year and decided to try the individual fangs like my friend had back in highschool. The night of Halloween, I scared my boyfriend's nephew and shocked others because they weren't expecting the teeth! I dressed in normal clothes to really throw people off and when they asked me what I was, I would hsss at them and give them a spook. I got a lot of compliments and questions on The only draw back was that it was difficult to eat (I had to take them out) and that they eventually rub the inside of your mouth raw after a long period time of wear."
2,Beautiful!,It looks JUST like the one in the movie! Absolutely beautiful! I wear mine almost every day. I get so many compliments! It's not too big or too small. I havent had a bit of problems with it and I'm so glad I purchased this ring.
1,One reason to buy this CD.,"This is Hawaiian music done very well. Darnall is a master arranger and player of string instruments. Most songs could be background music. However! Over the Rainbow is pure genius. Unforgettable. I would use the word, haunting. I think Judy Garland would approve."
2,Life Support,"A great ""page turner"" that kept me up all night to see the end. I enjoy all of Tess Gerritsen's work!"
2,Good Book- Medical Thriller,"I really thoroughly enjoyed this book. Toby was a good main character to the problems that were faced in the ER. It was interesting how dr. carl wallenberg was opposing her so much of the time! To find out more, read the book!"
1,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I first read Tess Gerritsen's book 'The Surgeon' and loved it, in fact I read it 3 times. But when I decided to check out some of her earlier work I was dissapointed. 'Life Support' is a pretty good story but who hasn't done the evil nursing bit? I think just about everyone has. Toby (the main character) was pretty cardboard. She was an ER doctor yet when it came to danger she was a wuss. What the? She ended the story very abruptly. I want to know what happened with Dr. Dvorak and I want to know what happened to Wallenberg and everyone.I do not recommend this book at all. I'll admit it's okay but come on! Why did certain people have to die? I just did not like what she did to some of the characters."
2,if you like....,"If you like her others, you will love this one, it reads fast, you wont be able to put it down"
2,Be prepared...,"This book is hard to read. Ever seen the movie 'The Blue Lagoon'? Especially late at night? It left me with a hollow feeling, a sadness that echoed into the depths of my very soul. This book is about 2 people in their mid-thirties who fall in love against their wills. Its painful to read because of the depth of emotion, the heroine's relationship with her father and Mad Dog, as well as his relationship with his son, whom he doesn't know is related. Make any sense? ...Anyway, if I could go back in time I wouldn't have read this book. It left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth - a compelling tale, but I think I'll stick to lighter reads from now on."
2,One of the best tapes ever from DBZ,In this tape we see Trunks power up to a level of Super Saiyan that surpasses his father and CELL! Even though the power slows him down he manages to put up A good fight until he realizes that his power is slowing him down. We also see Goku and Gohan training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber as Super Saiyans. We see Goku power up to SS2. In the episode Ghosts From Tomorrow we see the violent deaths of all the Z Fighters. I rate the Video 4 out 5 because there is just a lot of standing around. I hope this review helps all those DBZ fans out there.
2,The Amazing Review of The Ferguson Rifle by Chris Bullock,"The Ferguson Rifle is a really good book..It tells of the life and hardships the frontiersmen faced out on the lawless great plains.The main character,whose family was killed in a fire and is now leaving home, and a few trappers head west for the beaver rich mountains.They wind up on a wild goose chase when a woman they are protecting is being followed by a crazed man."
2,Love this book...,"Arrived quickly & in the described condition (hey, it was printed in 1965!) and is the perfect gift for anyone who like kitsch!"
1,Already included with 7-speed mixer,Works fine but don't buy this if you buy the seven-speed mixer. It's already included with the mixer and you only need one!
2,A help indeed!,"WOW.... was referred to this book by a friend. Can definately say it was worth the purchase. After having a girl when our son came along I was getting so frustrated. He was so different to her. Raising boys brought a lot of insight into why they are different but more importantly the stages that boys go through. It all made sense as I read. It has provided vital information for the future and how best to try to keep him out of ""trouble""."
2,Statlers Short Stories,"My original copy was stolen along with my truck 20 years ago, so I was happy to find a copy on Amazon. Some great songs I haven't heard in a long while."
2,A good RE-print!,"Main characters:Joni Evans and her four year old son Brady.Sam Crawford.Joni & Brady move from Chicago to Saddle (cute name), Wyoming.Brady decides to ask Santa for a daddy.If I remember correctly Sam was the Santa. He feels that the least he can do is find Brady's mother a man.There is always tension when a man decides that a woman needs a man around.This is a good book. However, IF it sounds familiar that is because this was previously released in 1995. This is not a new book.The previous edition Cowboy Santa (Christmas Is For Kids) (Harlequin American Romances, 755)"
1,Book has a misleading title.,"It's not really going to give you a checklist of things that you want to make sure you do before you sign. Instead it is a book that discusses in general a few things you might want to consider, but doesn't get into any one topic in depth, or even give you any real insider tips other than ""hire a real estate attorney"" or ""hire a buyer broker.""By the time I finished reading the book I felt like I had just read an advertisement for real estate lawyers and real estate brokers. The author doesn't teach you about the home buying process so much as he insist that you leave it up to the professionals. There is even a chapter devoted to the right way to treat your broker!I say skip this one or get it from your library if you really think you want to read it."
1,Not good,"Not worth the money, not worth the outrageous shipping charges. Nice smell. Other products that work better or as well can be had at a better price."
2,One of my Favorites,"This book was not at all what I expected. I am a huge fan of Emily Giffin books and one of my favorites is ""Something Borrowed."" ""How I Stole Her Husband"" is much like ""Something Borrowed"" in that it will have you rooting for the underdog. I couldn't put this book down!"
2,Was looking for something like a PS2 controller--found it.,"From a choice of about 15 gamepads I chose this one. It felt similar to the PS2 controller and had some weight to it (even before the batteries were installed). Installation was easy; installed software on a PC with 2000 for an operating system. I really enjoy the freedom of not having to worry about a cord. The inputs were received fine, but for the most part I was only a couple of feet from the receiver. However, at times I had the gamepad in my lap aiming down and even with the reciver above it it it worked fine...felt as if it must be connected via a cord. Good force feed back, too. Nice and solid and does the job for me. Hope you're pleased with it if you decide to buy."
2,I love my wingman!,"I love this thing. It plays better than any corded pad I own.Pros:Dual analog, rumble capabilities, and a digital pad.Triggers. Four of them. Excellent range and it's as responsive as a corded pad.Cons:Batteries. You need four of them (AA) I work around that by using rechargebles.It's heavy.Before trashing this thing due to compatability problems, go to logitec's website and get the newer drivers. They fixed any problems I had with my wingman."
2,I just listened to the whole thing...,"... after forgeting about this album for awhile, i decieded to give it a listen after a long time of not listening to any of my Rainbow albums. It is as good to my ears,maybe better,as the day i first put it in my cd player. This could be considered Rainbow's best album,(maybe tied with rising) and it definatly has some of their stongest work such as the title track, an anthem for all rock n roll fan's. What is interesting with a band like rainbow is that all of their albums sound differant, there is no worn out formula repeated with every LP but a new,fresh direction. just listen to the first three albums and hear what i mean, i think LLRNR proves this point perfectly, its still classic rainbow, but there is a different kind of magic going on here. i love all of the tracks so its hard to really name favorites."
2,Great album,"Last Rainbow album in the classic line-up and therefore a must have for Rainbow fans. I think Rainbow Rising is still there best recording, but this one has some great songs as well. I have the original LP and the production of the record is a bit ""light"". The remastered CD sounds a lot better, the only thing missing is some bonustracks."
1,Giving this Book Zero Stars...,"Is a *serious* overestimation of its usefulness.Schnobelen claims to have been highly-ranked in several religious organizations (Several of which didn't and don't exist, and at least *three* of which he claimed membership in simultaneously).Several of the other organizations he claims to have joined never even *offered* the services he claims to have obtained.Additionally, Schnobelen is a known disseminator of the 'Satanic Conspiracy' myth.Don't give this book, or this author, a second glace.As someone once said, 'It's not a book to put aside lightly; it should be thrown with great force'.Nothing more needs to be said."
1,Once again ANOTHER Christian Just NOT Understanding,"For anyone to say Wicca is that of Satan is totally wrong!!! I raise my chidren in the religion along with thousands and thousands of others, and believe me my children are far better then alot of their ""christian"" friends. Before Anyone writes a book on any subject they need to THINK I feel here he is Just Another single minded person, Preaching on something he trully knows nothing about!!! He is full of lies and Total Mis-Truths!!!"
1,Really??,"Sorry folks, but this guy doesn't have the foggiest clue what the truth is. i've been Wiccan for over 10years and WE DON'T WORSHIP SATAN OR EVEN BELIEVE IN A SATAN! Please get it right and get a clue! Besides this idiot claims to to have been a UFO abductee and a vampire! i think he's mental!"
2,A solid 12 song comp and best seller for Mercury since 1960,"This collection is a reissue of the classic compilation from 1960 entitled ""Golden Hits"" on Mercury which among its 12 songs are several of her signature songs including Tennessee Waltz, Doggie In The Window, Cross Over The Bridge, Changing Partners, Allegheny Moon and others from the early 1950s in their original form. Although the 2 volume ""Patti Page Collection"" and the boxed set ""A Golden Celebration"" are more comprehensive, this is still worth having for Patti Page on the go and this has been a perennial best seller since it was released in 1960. She would later sign with Columbia and come back with many more hits including ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" but to start with this is the cream of the crop and on this CD it includes ""With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming"" while the Millennium Collection is notable for restoring ""Let Me Go Lover"" back in print as the boxed set and Vol. 2 of the Patti Page Collection are now out of print."
2,Love the modern language,"I have an older copy of Morning and Evening and love Spurgeon's writing. However, this updated version is easier to read and I love having it on my Kindle for easy access!"
1,Had to return it...,"The hair dryer is very heavy. Also, while I like the yellow design of the dryer itself, the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool."
1,Beware! Not the same old FriChik,Please be aware that the 'Low Fat' variety of this product is NOT the same as the standard 'FriChik'. Whatever is removed to be able to sport the 'Low Fat' moniker makes a world of difference. Standard FriChiks are delicious while the 'Low Fat' variety are drier and less tasty (savory). I hope someone at Amazon will take notice and start offering the standard FriChik.
1,Crowded,"So now she has her ex-boyfriend, all the memories and knowledge of her alter-ego and Mr. Spock inside her head? Must be getting a bit crowded in there.Honestly this show is getting a bit silly."
2,Mind Blowing,"Season three of Fringe is a roller coaster. Fringe is one of the most exciting tv shows that always keeps you wanting more, especially at the end of season three!! Highly recommend this series so excited that is finally streaming somewhere. People can finally see what they have been missing."
2,Great Series,Sesson 3 provides another wonderful roller coaster of drama that makes it easy watching. Great cast that allows us the audience to engage most easily in these Sci-fy stories
2,It's good,Everything work out well. Shipment was on time and all the things were in good working order. The quality was good.
2,The Other Universe...,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series!! The other universe is in the forefront this season. An Interesting story line and great writing keep you hooked through out the season."
2,It'll make you think about your health benefits,Wonderful book! This will make you rethink the health benefit options you select at enrollment.
1,Absolutely Awful,"I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review. This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel. This guy went to Harvard? It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker. The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid. It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on? Maybe they went to Harvard, too). Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than ""making love."" We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words. Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters. Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", perhaps). This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel."
2,Great toys with squeakers,"This 3 pack is pretty good. I have a 5 lb. Yorkie and he doesnt care much for the 3 squeaking mini tennis balls but wow, he goes NUTS for the tiny bear with the squeaker (+ replacement squeaker). Absolutely nuts, crazier than when he gets pigs ears as treats. Pretty good product overall."
1,"Looks Good, But Isn't Good","So I saw ""Sin City""; another in a long line of films that look good, but aren't good. Yeah, I know there are sexy women and lots of nudity, but for these types of films a story would be nice. And while I respect Frank Miller as an artist, I am not really a fan of his work. Also, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have done much better in the past. See ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" for what I mean.I used to really respect Rodriguez as a director, but ever since he got caught up in the 3-D craze, he really hasn't made anything that has excited me since ""Spy Kids 2"". I'm referring to ""Spy Kids 3"" and ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"". Even his standard films like ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" have suffered.Rodriguez is currently working on a sequel to ""Sin City"". I can hardly wait (sarcasm)."
1,Possibly the worst movie I ever watched,"This movie is not worth the time wasted watching it. I repeat, TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Horrible writing, horrible acting","I just saw this movie. It's intended to be over-the-top, but it goes so far over that it becomes a self-parody. The writing is cheesy and cliched, and the actors can't help but overact to match.It's also interesting that the only jobs available to women in this movie's world are scantily clad waitresses, strippers, naked lesbian parole officers, and whores. I'm all for T&A;, but this was ludicrous.If you want to see excellent film noir that's sexy, violent, and amoral, check out Romeo Is Bleeding. Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick."
2,Casablanca for the 21st century,"Casablanca meets Death Wish in a beautiful festival of violence. Bruce Willis was Humphrey Bogart and Clive Owen was Charles Bronson. While Mickey Rourke actually sort of reminds me of King Kong. He's out of control and you know he's got to die but still its a shame. Sin City itself is set in a world where money has bought all power. In other words, it's the Republican vision of the future."
1,I was very surprised and dissapointed,"I really thought this movie was going to be the best for the year. It had such a big name cast and the special effects looked so cool; it was all exciting. what a surprise i was in for. firstly, the special effects are great. that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. your eyes will be dazzled. but it is boring, slow, and long. there is WAY too much talking. i've never ever seen a movie with so much talking in my life. and i don't mean talking as in ""give me action and stop the talking scenes."" i mean even when there's action they slide talking into the action scenes. it got so irritating; it was like shut up already, do these characters have to talk every single thing? additionally even though it is an action movie there isn't really that much action, i think that's what made it fail. jessica alba looks great in it though!"
1,Lacking,So this DVD seemed promising as the menu was up and I was geared up to watch this excellent movie...but then once it started something very important seemed to be missing....yes it was the audio throughout the film. There was audio in the menu but not the actual movie...so that was pretty lame
2,"Sin City in BD, the only way to truly enjoy this movie","Be warned, this movie is not for all to enjoy (hence the R rating), after all with the movie title being Sin City and based on adult themed comic, what else would you expect? It's filled with violent, black comedy and adult theme...but that is what Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's work are famous for and the reason (some) people love it...me one of 'em!The PQ is great, the way the monochrome contrasts the purposely expressed colours of reds and yellows and blue is just truly dazzling and eye popping! I luv it!!! Worth my every cent buying it in BD!!!!!The extras are abundant, ranging from the recut version of the film to background information on how it evolves from comic book to movie ranging from wardrobe design to cars...but sadly only some of the extras are in HD...Highly recommended for those that wants to treat their eyes! I know mine enjoyed it!!!"
2,So far one of 2005's bests...EASILY!,"This movie was so good to me in April,I couldn't wait for the DVD release mid-August.Put the kids to bed and enjoy.If you like Kill Bill Volume 1,gore and all,then this movie is for you.The director stuck to the original novels as much as possible and it shows.You add to that a brillant cast and you get two hours of pure entertainment.I won't give any of the plots away except to say that there are three.Remember:Not for the weak of stomachs"
2,great movie!,the way frank miller made this movie was like a 1950's crime novel. mostly in black and white with splashes of color! the three storys intertwine with each other! thhis is a must have in either DVD on on the Kindle.
1,misogynistic junk,"wow! hookers with heart! child rapists! brutal murder! senseless nudity!at first, i thought sin city was kind of entertaining in an escapist, comic book kind of way, but by the gazillionith gun-toting hooker parading around with her breasts exposed, & seven millionth lame-o, ""i'll blow your privates off, for messing with my dame!"" reference, i was ready to leave. (i would of, but i was with a group of people, and i didn't have anything with me to read).sure, the men are portrayed as scum bags and low-lifes, but they get to wear clothing, and fight for themselves. even the ""strong"" women are silenced, or inevitably must wait for a man to save the day in the end.if you feel like watching people get mutilated for 2 hours, have a good time. this digsusting, low-brow, demeaning movie is further proof that hollywood is way more interested in the ka-ching of a cash register than they are in generating art."
1,"GREAT MOVIE ,BUT NOT DVD!!!","I really liked and loved this movie. And I knew when comes to DVD, I would buy it for sure for my DVD collection ,but this DVD very simple and plain. Not double disk or DTS or nothing an all...if u really love this movie like I did,Wait a while till end the year I am VERY SURE they going to come with DTS or Superbit Or Dir cut,I am going to wait for sure to get the whole McCoy. These days they do that with most movies, Then after few months they come up with all loaded stuffs on DVD."
1,Sin City,Typical Quentin Tarantino film. You either love him or you hate him. This film was very gratuitous sex and violence wise. Not a whole lot of deep plot thinking. I did give it atleast two stars for the unusual filming techniques and special effects.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I was dragged to the theaters by my brother to go see this movie. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it (action is not usually my thing), but this was far worse than I could imagine. It was actually the worst movie I have ever seen. The longest two hours of my life. I have never read the comic books on which this movie is based on, so I was confused out of my mind. The movie went from one story to another, without any real connection between stories. The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering. This movie is pretty much just violence and hookers. No real story or plot. Just violence and hookers. Like I said, don't waste your money. This movie was beyond horrible."
1,yikes!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the one reviewer was right, this movie is for geeks and homebound comic book readers, sixty bullet holes and still moving, now that takes quite an imagination, and talk about no daylight anywhere in this flick, you geeks have got to get out of your parents house more often."
1,I had to turn it off after an hour...,This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching. It's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.Skip this one unless you like the comic books.
1,"hate to give a blockbuster a 1, but...","dudes, it's like, Alba is the deaalll; i could watch her fold napkins and pay money to see it, but, really now, i swear i could not get through this film. no sense of morality. reminds me of a film i checked out cause i thought it was, like, kickn... Caligula... you know, no moral compass means i get confused. i mean, i love slasher films, don't get me wrong, its just that they have right and wrong. this film has a big production budget and design budget, and it tries to be like an episodic comic book -- pulp fiction???? i don't like any of the characters, bottom line. end of story. i'm out. j."
1,Junk,"Quite the worst film I have ever seen in my 76 years!The inadequacy of the above rating system reminds me of the story about the old Danish professor who found himself forced to modify the usual marking system in order to do justice to the proficiency of his students. In the usual system the highest mark was 6, 4 was pass. He had to extend the system downwards to -23. I give this movie the mark -24."
1,Tired of these kind of releases,"Love this movie! A must see movie! Hate these kinds of releases though. I'm waiting for the Dec 2 disc release with all of the extras. The only thing I'm happy about is that they told us another deluxe DVD was coming. It doesn't make the wait any easier though. I was anxiously awaiting this movie on DVD, but now I have to wait until December. I guess I might rent the DVD so I can watch the movie again, but I'm tired of buying movies and then having a deluxe version coming out later. Hellboy, Daredevil, X-men 1.5, etc... We have to get the industry to stop this."
2,Very artistic,"This movie is very graphic and dark - themed, but it isn't one of those stupid action movies like Die Hard or Resident Evil (the games are much better than the movies). It's very artistic, with a lot of plot and story. There are 4 stories in this movie, and a few of them intersect. Anyone who is faint of heart should not watch this movie."
1,"Not a review, but a comment.","I loved Sin City. I thought the style and cinematography were genius. However I have to say, I'm getting a little tired of these bare bones DVD's that come out months before the big Uncut Unrated Extended Deluxe Never Before Seen Director's Cut Version is released. Why can't they just release the good version and the barebones version at the same time? Give people an option, and give them a break while they're at it?"
2,Terribly violent movie,"How much violence does a movie-viewer tolerate? Be it cult or not, it is frightening how such a movie celebrates what Kill Bill and others started: Being extremely violent is and looks sexy. A psychogram of today's society. Besides that a brilliantly filmed movie with convincing actors in a weird story. Who cares? It is a comic strip movie with real actors behaving like their sketched alter-egos. Certainly not the real life. It is definitely Frank Miller's very dark and hopeless world. Every single shot looks like a frame out of his books. I'd recommend it only for a very mature audience but I know that kids will watch it first..."
1,the casual humdrum of death and male ego...yawn....,"Where are the intelligent and creative masses that yearn for expression other than the casual humdrum of death and male ego???...yawn.... Boring! This movie is made for unintelligent 19 year old boys who are filled with frustration, anger, and of course hormones. I may also add the few 40 year olds hiding out in the darkness of their dens while their wives and children are sleeping. Please....Please...Let's get creative without the use of ""Hos"" and extreme graphic ""violence."" Are male comic-book authors so dull in their senses? This movie was crap! May I restate ""was."" As it quickly faded to a distant hiccup of a memory... now it simply ""isn't."" Good Day Sir...I said Good Day! ;-D"
1,Not worth seeing,"The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books. However, not having read these comics, the plot didn't make sense. My husband had the same reaction. I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity, but the continuous violence was a turn off. Overall, I wish I'd stuck with just watching the trailer."
1,"Boxing Day, a One-sided View","While Jeff Wells does an excellent job capturing the tenor of the times he does Tommy Burns a grave disservice in treating him as the bad guy of his story, and Johnson the great hero. Burns could have done what previous holders of the heavyweight championship had done, and flatly refused to give Johnson a shot at the title. But, unlike the others, he allowed Johnson, a black man, his big chance. It was Johnson who turned his back on his race and denied similar opportunities to Sam Langford, Joe Jeannette, and Sam McVea. Jack Johnson was a talented fighter, but not much of a human being."
1,Absolutely Disappointing,"I have no problem with a group experimenting, being creative, or going in a different direction...but this CD is completely void of anything memorable.Silly, unfunny, incoherent, jumbled, uncreative...all would be words to describe this CD. I loved the first two releases from them, but it seems their creative energy has turned into some kind of mumbled, electronica pop with no soul.Critics love the single ""We Used To Be Friends"" and that should tell you something right there.Trendy hipsters might elevate this release to classic status because of their lack of objectivity and general willingness to go along with whatever's popular and cool - but anyone looking for a memorable, long lasting, quality CD should look elsewhere.I'm sorry but this CD garbage, truly disappointing considering how promising and good their first two releases were."
1,Hey Courtney...,"Concentrate more on songwriting, less on filmmaking. And what's wiith the bong hit thing? That's so Beastie Boys. Come on."
2,An Invaluable Find,"I teach a course on the history of Witchcraft at a local esoteric shop, and this book was invaluable to my research. Wilmhurst assumes that the reader already has some background in Masonry, so I don't recommend this as a first-read to anyone just beginning to learn about either Masonry or the Mysteries. However, for any serious student of the occult, mysticism, magick, Witchcraft, Masonry or the Mystery traditions, this book is an excellent find. All of the bits and pieces of information I've picked up over the years concerning Masonry make a great deal more sense now.Concerning Wilmhurst's writing style: on a few occasions I had to go back and re-read a passage to catch the meaning, but didn't find the author's language problematic, as some reviewers have complained. However, this book is adapted from a series of lectures, so I will forewarn that it can be repetitive. Overall, I found that the content of the author's material far outweighed the somewhat unfamiliar writing style."
2,Great family movie!,This movie was a really a nice surprise! Bindi Irwin did a great job and all the characters are played very well. My five and two year old daughters LOVE this movie and watch it over and over. I think I like this free willy movie the best out of the whole series.
1,Nothing like the original kong,"I don't like this toy. It's an odd shape, doesn't roll and a weird space for treats. You have to break the treats up to get them to fit then they just fall out! Don't waste your money!"
1,Not for aggresive chewers,"I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 lb springer spaniel mix). She rips toys apart with her incisors. She ripped the tabs off around the hole opening in a few minutes. She has not done any additional damage to the main body of the ball. I am sure the ball would be great for normal chewers, but the tabs around the hole could not stand up to my beast."
1,Useless for non chewers,"Stuffing treats inside isnt useful as they pop out too easily. Might be fun for heavy chewers, but if not, look elsewhere."
1,Dog destroyed it within 30 minutes,The toy lasted about 30 minutes. Not much more to say than that. I obviously wouldn't recommend it for anyone.
2,"I have 3, two large and one smaller","I have three of these balls, I also have 3 dogs. A DDR German Shepherd at 96lbs, a 60lb Husky mix and a 45lb Collie mix. The two smaller dogs love these toys. The shepherd (Blitz) saw me lightly toss the ball and treats fall out so Blitz will pick up the toy and throw it against the wall. HOme and toy still survives even today. Great way to keep dogs happy on a rainy day or before they go to bed. These can survive in my house I know they are built to last."
2,Bit on the Dark Side,"I got this book because I so enjoyed ""The Devil's Waters,"" the first Robbins book I read. However, ""Assassins"" doesn't seem to be anything like ""Waters"" and starts out very darkly with the macabre murders of two civil defense volunteers in New England. I started it, then stopped and read another WWII mystery, ""Billy Boyle,"" then came back to it. I'm still not finished. One thing that drives me nuts as an editor is that he repeatedly uses the phrase, ""alright,"" instead of the grammatically correct ""all right."""
2,I Love Historical Fiction,"I love historical fiction, especially World War II related, especially if it's a thriller.So this book was right down my ally. It starts out with a bang and never lets up. I recently read another World War II thriller that is like a book end to thisIt's ""Stealing Trinity"" by Ward Larsen and it's focus is on the end of the war. ""Stealing Trinity"" is this author's second thriller. The first, ""The Perfect Assassin"" is awesome, too. Keep these types of books coming, guys!!"
2,Mac users - There is no problem,I am writing this review solely for the purpose of rebutting the other reviews that say this printer won't print borderless ona Mac using iPhoto. That is absolutely wrong. This person obviously does not know how to properly use the software and Epson drivers. This is a killer little printer and works perfectly on a Mac in iPhoto. Just make sure you set all settings everywhere (including iPhoto) to 4x6 and use the borderless option in the driver.
1,RIPPED OFF,"I was ripped off. This printer was listed as NEW but arrived USED AND BROKEN, I did what AMOZON told me too do. I sent item back and Never got my money."
1,I don't care for this printer,"This photo printer will crop your photographs regardless whether you cropped or not. The person that you photographed will have their head cut off! if their head is close to the edge. Make sure you have plenty of empty space between your subject and the edge of your photo before you send it to print. In other words, don't have your subject fill the whole photograph. Have your subject centered with plenty of room because it will crop top to bottom and left to right - all sides. Like said before, this printer will do this regardless whether you choose to crop or not."
2,Very handy printer,"This is you: You bought a digital camera and took a lot of pictures, but you don't print many because it is a pain in the neck and expensive and the printer runs out of one color of ink in the middle of printing or it gets streaks. You try using Ofoto or Shutterfly, but the uploading is pretty time-consuming as well and then you need to wait a week to get your prints. THIS THING IS THE ANSWER. It produces 4x6 prints quickly without even turning on your computer. The paper and the ink are sold bundled so you know the cost (29 cents/page) and the ink doesn't run out in the middle of a print job. I still have an Epson 2200 for printing larger prints, but this printer fills a real need in quickly and cheaply making prints to share with friends. Highly recommended."
2,Epson Photomate Photo Printer,Prints very clear quality pictures and does not have to be hooked up to the computer.
2,review,"Product arrived on time. Took a week playing with settings to get the sound I wanted. User/Setup manual needs a thorough Index. Seems like a good unit, but does run quite hot to the touch. Time will tell the whole story."
1,onkyo 7.1 worst electronic purchase ever,"i bought this receiver a yr ago & it has already quit working (at the most inconvenient time**, i might ad) it has to be shipped off to houston to be repaired, a real headache. i've replaced it with a pioneer 7.1 receiver.i'm 55 yrs old & i bought a pioneer receiver in 1974, a sony receiver in 1984, & a technics 5.1 receiver in 1998, & they all still work & are being used today. Thanks ""onkyo"" for bringing 38 years* of uninterrupted listening to a halt, & i'm sure pioneer thanks you for the sale also.*owned a sansui in 1970** football party, its pretty hummililating watching a football game on a 1080 hdtv with the tv sound"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this phone because of the range and speaker phone feature. I immediately found that the phone kept displaying ""line 2"" active when there was only one line to the phone. The battery in the handset died after only two months and a replacement never charged. When I returned it to the manufacturer via instructions I received a factory-reconditioned older phone with only 900 mhz in return with no other explanation. I will never buy a UNIDEN phone again."
1,Difficult to hold,"We have other cordless can openers in the past and this one really disappointed us. While this may be a really great can opener, it is difficult to hold while opening a can. We also found it to be very noisy. I would not recommend this product to and older person."
1,Not pleased with product,"The knife on the can opener will not penetrate some cans, therefore it will not open them. Some can edges appear to be different heights which probably contributes to the problem. It never occurred to me that it would be unsatisfactory so when I unpacked it, I discarded the box and packing, otherwise I would have returned it. I am very unhappy with this cutter, especially as much as it cost and will shop around for another kind. Would not recommend."
2,Fantastic Can Opener 2 Years and Going Strong,"We're coming up on two years of steady use with this little jewel and very happy with it. It takes a little practice at first learning the proper way to position it, but I'm able to do it with one hand (No I'm not Hercules). My wife also gives it 5 stars and wants me to buy an extra one in case they discontinue it. She's not very strong and has never had any problem puncturing the can to get it started. It's very compact and comes apart easily to clean. This is one of our favorite kitchen tools. Highly recommend."
1,Not fun!!,"I bought this item because the reviews said it was fun, and did a good job. I find it very difficult to puncture a can and get it started running. It seems that the design makes the leverage all wrong. Then when I do get it to start, it often cuts out. I am not really happy with it and expect I will have to find another can opener to get the job done."
1,Cordless can opener,Was not able to use after around 3 cans. Recharging was OK but the opener just did not have the torque to open larger numbers of cans.
1,Hand Held Opener,"This is an unique opener in that it is one handed and battery operated, but I find it hard to hold it and start the opening process. I am a mechanic and still find it hard. Once started it does a good job of opening the can. I also found that it doesn't shut off automatically once the can is open, but I've never seen that in any opener. Just have to stop the action by releasing the switch."
1,Disappointed,This device does open cans but it is difficult to position to get it started. It was purchased to replace a 25 year old opener that was easy to use one handed and required no strength to make it work. This one requires that you are able to push hard with your thumb (which I cannot do due to joint problems) in order to operate. If you ave 2 good hands it is fine. I need something else. Keeping this and my husband uses it.
1,One star is too many,"This gizmo is a costly dud. The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice. The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date. They had not. Then the last strip worked. I must have made a mistake, I thought, so I stupidly bought another $25 box of test strips. Now, the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in. It will not accept even one of the new test strips. I emailed the company's ""customer service"" department. They eventually gave me a refund for the second box of strips.Do not even think about buying this thing."
1,"Cherry--maybe, bomb--definately.","The only reason that I bought this was for the song ""Cherry Bomb"" and even that was disappointing. Jayne County did a much better version. And yes, the lyrics are pathetic and the music predictable. This will definately be going into my resell pile."
2,"GREAT, but not as good as it sounds....","So im in circuit city looking at gaming mice. i see this one, and immeadieatly the 1800dpi attracts me. also, it has a bunch of other features that make this mouse unmatched for its price. I bought it, and tryed it, expecting an AMAZING change from my old mouse. what I got was just my old standard Dell mouse, except the sensitivety was turned up, something you can change. what i mean is, don't buy this mouse for its features. it is a great mouse and feels great in your hands, and the scroll wheel is really cool. the 1800dpi, it doesnt really matter. Im giving it 4 stars for the feel and ease of use"
1,Don't Buy Defective Product and No Returns,"Do not purchase any of the items from razer. First of all, when i purchased this mouse it looks and feels very cheaply made. Its like a KINDERGARDEN TOY. At the same time i purchased a keyboard along with the mouse. When i received the keyboard the page down button was not even attached to the keyboard, the clipping was BROKEN and then the W key for the keyboard DID NOT WORK. I asked for a refund sinec i purchased the product through Razer.They made it difficut to refund. The first email i sent out was March 10, 2010 and now it is March 22, 2010 and they still have not given me a RMA number after i requested it FIVE TIMES. This is ridiculous. I will be submitting a DISPUTE to the credit card company."
1,Weems & Plath Barometer,"A nice looking decoration to hang on the wall, but it never agrees with the local barometric readings. I set it to read the same as the local reading, but it never reads the same again. After setting it multiple times I just gave up and use it as a rather expensive thermometer."
1,the 900 days;,"Having made 2 trips toSt. Petersburg in the past 3 years, both guides highly recommended this book. It is incredibly well written, both the background leading up to the atack as well as the hardships over the next 2+ years. The fortitude and heroism portrayed give a much better understanding of the Russian people and what they endured."
1,Disappointing/undisciplined/incomplete,"Salisbury certainly must be embarrassed by this book. It is not even an acceptable first draft. If the title were changed to 'The first 90 Days' it would be more accurate. His time line is a mess. He space is just as bad as he provides no sense of the geography or the role it played. Reader never knows when and where he is. Also, Salisbury writes as though artists were the only ones to suffer the horror...ignoring the 1 million others who died.I bought this book because of the reputation of the author. Silly me. I wasted my time... and lost a hero.To learn of the siege, read Glanz's two books ... one on the military history, the other... the history of the ""City of Heroes"" during the siege. Both are first rate."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful",This is what happens when a junior high school film project gets a national release. Everything about this movie SUCKED. I suffered through 20 minutes of it trying to give it a chance...the only thing I got was a void of 20 minutes in my life that I will never get back. Learn from my mistake: DONT DO IT. Save yourself. This belongs in the category of double A (AA...all puns fully intended!) Awful and Amateur.
2,Early Asimov Still Beats Par,"It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's great Science Fiction works remain out of print. The three `Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some, the reason these novels are called `Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire referenced in the Foundation series began, during its infancy and during its peak. Very much fun indeed."
1,Poor Quality Workmanship,"I read every review that I could and finally picked the Phillips 8"" even though it was more expensive due to the poor write ups the other digital picture frames were receiving. I agree totally with everyone that the transfer software from the PC is a piece of junk. Very poor for such a well known company. Even with all that, I was ready to keep the frame but within two days the leg which swivals to allow a landscape or portrait view, failed and the frame would not even stand up. I am in the process of returning the frame to Amazon now. To their credit, since I bought this as a gift for my wife, they have extended the return period to Jan 31, 2007."
2,GREAT CASE,"My A540 fits great and it also held two SD card and two extra batteries, and fits right on my belt/belt loop on back of the soft case and didn't fall off nor did anything fall out during my 16 Day cruise from Miamii to San Francisco throught the Panama Canal! Perfect travel case for your camera!"
1,Not compatible with Canon A630,"I got this case along with A630 since the product description mentioned that it is compatible with the A630. However, this case is just too small and the camera does not fit into the case. This product is not compatible with the A630."
2,Canon camera case review,The case is made of high quality material and fits my Canon powershot A700 perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars if the case had a seperate compartment for carrying an extra set of batteries. There is just enough room to carry the camera and an extra memory chip. No extra batteries.
2,Canon A520 Case,The case is great! It fits the camera perfectly and is exactly what I expected to receive when ordering. The price was right but the shipping was a little higher than I expected.
1,Too small!,The case is too small for my A630 and it doesn't look like the one shown in the picture. The lid can barely be closed and no room for anything else. I am very disappointed at this product.
1,Doesn't fit A640,"This product lists the A640 as one it works with. It doesn't. Not even a tight fit. Just flat out doesn't fit.But, since it costs more to return it than throw it away, I'm stuck with it now."
1,Great photos--flawed recipes,"My husband is a chef, I cook and bake often, and was even a personal chef. We've tried two of these recipes so far and neither have worked! One of them was completely off in the dough and couldn't possibly have worked and the other we are still working on. It's for a portion of a recipe that has toffee. We have resorted to finding another toffee recipe online and will try to make that and incorporate it in the recipe. It is very disappointing! I've tried this portion 3 times now with no luck. Thats just not right. Buy this book only for the photos and try to make them by using other recipes that you know and trust or use a reputable site with user reviews. We've ate at Trotters and it was good, but we've both had better meals for less money."
1,Foghorn Flounders,"I tried to get through this CD again the other day, but couldn't. Miss Dalys voice makes Carol Channing sound like Maria Callas. One to miss."
2,Latter Days,"In this case, the book was based on the movie that preceded the book. I loved the movie, and I couldn't wait to read the book - and I wasn't disappointed.An easy read that combines a great story, just enough religious information focused on Latter Day Saints activities involving religious missions, families, and homophobia. It involves a gay character, a coming of age story, and a coming out story.A nicely written book that is a fun read. I certainly would recommend it to both teens and adults."
1,"Good guide to the battlefield, average history","Uffindell clearly spent lots of time walking the battlefield and has an excellent knowledge of it. He is also enthusiatic about his subject and the book is a good read. However, it is bad history. Too often, the myths about the campaign are repeated as fact. Too often questionable statements by Uffindell's hero Wellington are taken at face value. Of course, the British did nothing worng in this campaign and foreigners like the Prince of Orange, Dornberg and Ziethen are to blame for Wellington's errors. This book is very much inferior to Hofschroer's work."
1,Pure garbage,"This book reflects a message about what I'm thinking is the author's own religious bias. It's garbage. No where does it even mention population control, overpopulation causing climate problems, the need for birth control, poverty amongst peoples with no birth control. It's wordy."
1,Supplier,"The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem. The shoes that arrived had been worn. I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had. He made a good offer however, I decided to wash the shoes and keep them, which I did. Now, I have an infection on my toe. Not good."
2,Easy Purchase,"Love them, easy purchase, easy return (ran longer than I expected) I usually need a 7 or 7.5 but needed a 6.5 in this. Quick turn around on purchase."
2,Love Love Love,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
1,All right if you're slumming it,"Eh. I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap, but I should have paid more attention to the reviews. The quality is way low with these shoes. They're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they're packed in sardines. (And I have really small feet - I'm a women's 5.5) Now that I see them on my feet, they don't even look that cute. Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem: androgynous, passably okay sneakers that aren't good for running or walking for long periods of time. If you pay 20 bucks for them, you will receive a pair of shoes that are reasonably comfortable for 20 bucks (read: not very comfortable at all) and your footwear will be boring, un-expressive and nondescript. Whatever. Buy a pair if you're slumming it or into gardening or something, but otherwise go get some combat boots or something. These shoes are boring."
1,Mislabeled,"I have worn Keds sneakers for many years, always ordering size 6.5.The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5, but this sneaker is at most size 5, or it is a child's sneaker.Very disappointed."
2,Keds black sneaker,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
1,Not like Death Note at all,"The acting was terrible and L's character had no opportunity to be the eccentric genius he usually is. It lacked the thrill, suspense, quarks, and story line of the previous two movies and the series itself. But if you love Death Note this movie lets you see two more hours of L..."
2,A spectacular growing up book,"This was one of my favorite childhood books. No, it's no longer the right thing to do to buy a child a puppy as a birthday present, but barring that out of date idea, the book is a timeless classic. It's one children enjoy having read to them again and again. I'll always remember Bitsy's beds. Highly recommended."
1,Poorly written and edited.,The book is poorly written and edited. He never does get the name of the Viet Cong sniper rifle spelled right. The author without mentioning any names calls into question the actions of late Gunnery Sgt. Carlos N. Hathcock II. I wonder why he doesn't write another book calling into question the actions of Sgt. Alvin York or Lt. Audie Murphy. If you want to read a good book skip this one. I was let down by this one.
1,Brass slide jammed,"I just got the marking gauge and just as described in another review, the brass slide was jammed. I'd rather pay more and get a fully functional gauge than one that's only half functional."
2,Altec Lansing XT2 Speakers,Heard about these speakers on XM Radio and decided to buy and try them. When I got them was surprised at how easy to connect and the sound. Sound is just Fantastic. My laptop never sounded so good with all the music I have downloaded. Recommend these to anyone useing a laptop at home.
2,"most admired beatle album, though not favorite","There's plenty of reason for 27 straight weeks in the number one spot and four grammy awards. The songwriting, engineering and visual artistry were not so much ahead of their time, but rose above the standard, while doing something only classical musicians had tried to do before 1967, make a timeless definitive statement.Most popular and most mentioned songs people note, include With a Little Help from My Friends, When I'm Sixty-Four, and the darker A Day in the Life.I was always taken with the contemplative She's Leaving Home and Fixing a Hole.One thing I like about my CD re-release over my original LP (aside from the fact the LP is worn out) is that I can program out Good Morning and Lovely Rita Meter Maid. With those two gone, I enjoy the album almost as much as I do Abbey Road."
1,car crash victims don't sing and play the bass,"Hi, my name's Scott, I'm 12 next spring I have been studying all Beatle litterature and theirown sleazy CDs and I have come to find without a single shotgun doubt that PMC was really killed beyond reecognition after the infamous carcrash that took his life on wednesdaymnornnng at 9 o clock.Listen, grandiose naysayers and other friends, you just can't go on pretending he's still the same today as he was burns of the Past Age' - the man is really no more, he is exit, finito, passed on to the merry pastures, he's friggin dead.See why Heather Mills was so upset when she found out she married an imposter.Cheers Bob, here's to ya!Scott"
1,Rolling Stone should know better..,"Come on, the greatest album in the history of rock? I think not! This was an arty farty experimental pop album at best. At worst it is over extravagance that doesn't know what it's trying to be. The Beatles are the most pampered and over indulged pop group in all of popular music history. Were they talented? YES. Are they overrated? Most certainly, and none more so than this album. Revolver is worthy of being in the top 10 of any poll. But this album never should be. When I am 64 indeed..."
2,A beautiful medley of great songs,"The only reason why I gave Sg. Pepper 4 stars is because I got sick of it. But I remember every night listening to it striaght through, over and over again. Some say that ""Within you without you"" is the one song they skip over, but they obviously haven't given it enough consideration. They hear the sitars and they just bug out. This is world music. Yes, it's different than the normal electric guitars, bass, and drums for a band, but it's a great song. It's very melodic. A Day in the Life is a classic, and I think often overlooked, Beatles song. From the beginning fatalism and surrealism to Paul's little solo vocal down to the crashing last piano chord, the song is just powerful. This may be one the best CDs to give someone who is just being introduced to the Beatles or they dont have it and they are fans. That or the Imagine Soundtrack. That is a great CD too."
1,For the Archives,"There is some history that is still relevant today and there is other that should be recognized as influential in its time, then filed away. I own this on vinyl and have framed both the cover and the record as decoration. I never saw a need to replace it on CD, for the simple reason that songs like ""When I'm 64"" and ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" are badly dated, not really standing the test of time. On the other hand, another 1967 release, ""Are You Experienced"" by Jimi Hendrix, is still challenging musicians today. This cover is also on the wall, but the CD is in the player. Big difference. 2-stars at best for Pepper."
1,car crash victims don't sing and play the bass,"Hi, my name's Scott, I'm 12 next spring I have been studying all Beatle litterature and theirown sleazy CDs and I have come to find without a single shotgun doubt that PMC was really killed beyond reecognition after the infamous carcrash that took his life on wednesdaymnornnng at 9 o clock.Listen, grandiose naysayers and other friends, you just can't go on pretending he's still the same today as he was buried on high farm in Scotland 'all those years ago'.

1,"Quaint, but over-rated.","This is the album self-deluded Beetles fans love to point to as their work of genious. Lemon and McCarthy were alledgedly at the top of their form.Oh, come now!It's a quaint period piece; a relic of the sixties. The music sounds dated. It's nostalgia, but nostalgia ain't art!You'd do better to get ""Pet Sounds"", written, arranged, and produced by a REAL genious: Brian Wilson. It sounds as fresh and sophisticated today as when it was first released.Future generations will revere Brian Wilson's music the way Beethoven's is revered now. The Beetles will be a mere footnote in history if they get mentioned at all.Save your money, and pick up ""Pet Sounds"" instead; you'll be glad you did.- Mean Mr. Mustard"
1,Crowned a TOPPER!!!!!,hI to everyone.Im gonna say it like it is. This album is terrible and dull.Oh yeh and it's hopelessly contrived and utterly passable.Let me count votes.I expect a 100 whining 'no's by 12 o clock tonite.Bless y'all
1,Falls Short,"It was disappointing to discover that this CD falls short of all the praise it seems to get in these reviews, but with songs like When I'm 64, Within You Without You, Fixing A Hole, and Benefit of Mr. Kite, I just have to be honest.Some of the other songs are good (A Day in the Life) but one song doesn't save an album. Some Beatle albums are better, like Help, but this is only about a 2-star CD."
2,"undeniably influential, but...","This album certainly expanded the boundaries of what pop music could be, but in doing so strays a little far from the roots of rock for my tastes. I find the almost complete absence of George Martin's name from other reviews to be vexing. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all do their part, to be sure, but I don't think George Martin gets enough credit (not just for this album but for The Beatles, period). In short, it's a must-have, but on the whole, give me Revolver."
2,The Mastery Of Sgt. Pepper,"Sgt. Pepper changed it all,after Revolver,The Beatles tried a different approach that changed Rock-n-Roll forever,not only the classical music,the whole concept of wearing band uniforms,the longer hair,each sporting facial hair,changing their whole image and not to mention the greatest cover in the history of Rock-n-Roll with wax celebrities in the background,Marilyn Monroe,Cassius Clay,Fred Astaire,Bob Dylan,Laurel and Hardy,the early Beatles,flat out ingenious and so is the timeless music,A Little Help From My Friends,Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,She's Leaving Home,Lovely Rita,Fixing A Hole,and When I'm Sixty Four,don't forget one of the most distinctive and famous intros on a rock song ever,a simple,yet powerfully affective drumbeat on the title track reprise of Sgt. Pepper,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,enough said."
2,Greatest Album Ever,This album redefined the Beatles and redefined rock music in general. Everyone on the whole planet should own this album. Everyone who I know who hates the Beatles loves this album.
1,Pretentious tripe,"I am a big fan of progressive rock. What I don't understand is how people can rip Yes, King Crimson, etc to pieces and how they can be barred from entering the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Yet, this pile of pop-garbage is hailed as the greatest thing since sliced bread. This album stands as a monument to the self-righteous, bloated image of the horrible baby-boomer demographic. How can people say this is visionary music, and in the same breath deride a true genius like Robert Fripp? Face it, the Beatles are nothing more nor less than the 1960's N'Sync. And why are all Beatles cd priced so high? Because they know they can fool the conumer into buying this tripe. This disc makes a good coaster and nothing more. Don't waste your money. Thank you for reading this."
1,just wondering,Thanks for reading my review. I have only one short consideration.What wood this disk have sounded like WITHOUT intoxicating substances? You TThank you!
2,Best album with best song ever made!,"This is my favorite Beatles' album. Yes, Revolver and Rubber Soul have the top 10 hits, but Sgt. Pepper has the masterpieces. 'A Day in the Life' is one of the greatest songs of our times, but 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' IS THE BEST ROCK SONG OF ALL TIME! It is too bad that the Beatles did not release 'Lucy' as a single because it sure would have spent months at number one in 1967. Elton John's version of the song went to number one and it was released around 10 years later!"
2,wow,"It may not be the best Beatles CD, but I have a hard time picking out a better album that is not by the Beatles (as a band or solo). If you like classic music, you'll love Sgt. Petter."
2,One of the greatest albums of all time . . .,". . . and, if not THE greatest, at least the most influential. What other reviewers on here don't think about is the time this album came out. The Beatles had a way of beating everyone else to the punch: they knew what was coming next, and played in suit. This is indeed the first Rock album (forget rock & roll for now) and it paved the way for almost EVERYthing that followed. It opened numerous doors, and influenced not only every recording artist of then and now, but also pop culture in its entirety. The direction our society took was influenced to a certain degree by this one album . . . it was the soundtrack to the summer of love, and it was the first fully mature Rock album."
2,Overrated,"Half this album's allure, at the time and historically, stems from the cover.Many of the songs, Lovely Rita, Good Morning, Fixing a Hole, She's Leaving Home, are not that strong. The title song sounds like a [bad] version of Drive My Car.Only Lucy in the Sky and Day in the Life are enduring classics. If they hadn't adorned the album with weird sounds and a fantastic cover, it might have been panned like Magical Mystery Tour, which in many ways is a stronger album."
2,Sgt. Peppers (1967 album...1987 CD),"The Beatles/ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: I'm perfectly happy with my old CD version of this nearly perfect album. There is no need for me to describe this album to you. If you don't have a copy, you need to get one. Having this version of the CD for a long time, I have yet to see a reason to replace it with a newer CD. This album would obviously earn the sixth star in this rating system."
1,Shameful Packaging,"42 years later and Sgt. Pepper is as brilliant as ever...enough said, further accolades superfluous. However, how can anybody justify the sale of such an iconic cd in a cardboard envelope? Shame on you Amazon and E.M.I.! Would a simple, elegant crystal cover have cut that much into the bottom line?"
2,Wonderfully Put Together! I Love it!,I love it. I'm 11 and I heard all this stuff about the Beatles. Thought I'd try it out. After this CD I got Beatles 1. It was even better. I like how it's put together and the song about Paul at the end. It's cool how George has a song too. This is a great album. It's great for kids and adults and anyone who's willing to listen...
2,Paul's Shining Moments,"It's not that I don't like this album. Revolver is just better. The most interesting thing about this album is that Paul actually sings a song about himself in the first person and ends up (purposely) sounding like John. I'm referring, of course, to ""Fixing a Hole,"" and few people give him credit for being able to capture the essence of John's style. I think Paul was messing about to see just how far he could stretch himself as a songwriter.Can you imagine John trying to imitate Paul as a songwriting exercise? I can't. Also, this album contains the best song to sample it's silence so that you can clean up the analog hiss off of the Beatles' albums. ""When I'm 64"" offers a section where the clarinets pause where you can get a nice long sample of Abbey Road hiss."
1,Over-inflated Piffle!,"Just try getting through Mr. Kite or Within You Without you. A condescending middle finger to the fans that appreciated of them as a rock and roll band. By this point in their careers (read:millionaires), the Beatles knew the cound serve any pretentious **** they wanted. They just didn't CARE. Search Yoko Ono for the for the complete artistic emasculation of John Lennon."
2,These are wonderful for teaching phonemes,"This is a good system that my children's school uses. I have been an early childhood teacher for 5 years and I would have loved this system. I didn't have access to the RIGGS system in the schools I taught at. This requires a lot of parental involvement, however, so it may not be good for schools with low parental participation. These cards can be purchased for under $23 on the RIGGS website and I am disappointed to see them so drastically overpriced on here."
2,Great Books,"Francesca Lia Block has the ability to take you anywhere in her beutifully writtern books and in this she takes you to the over exposed world of the Valley. All her books are magical, this one espescially so. I would reccomend it to anyone."
1,Bad book!!,After reading good reviews and liking the idea of the story I just couldn't get into this book. I was really excited and was very disappointed! It was vague and just didn't flow. I tried and tried and couldn't get through half the book.
1,Argh! Read this!,"I love faeries. they are beautiful amazing creatures that allow people to escape reality. So, as you could expect i was instantly attracted to this book. I regret that. I had my mother buy it for me, and when i got home i read it in about an hour. the beginning is amazing. truly amazing. but the end is weak and dumb. i expected more. the boy barbie hooks up with is extremely vulgar and wrong. this book is not about a faerie or a girl. its simply sexuality. i am 12, and know a lot for a child my age but even for me... this book lakced a good ending. poor. dont buy it."
2,Botany at its most entertaining,"The author loosely applies the label ""North American Wildflower"" to all blossoms now running free on our continent. Many were brought over by early European settlers and the plants quickly jumped out of the garden and into the wild. Author includes snippets for each plant from other literary sources dating throughout the centuries (some very funny and bawdy!)"
2,Neat!,"I don't know how popular this game was, since there are no reviews for it on amazon but I think that it's a pretty good game. The graphics are infinitely better than the previous installment, Allied Assualt, and there are more weapons. You start out parachuting into the top of a French barn and fighting your way to your buddies. I think the highlight of this game is playing the Battle of the Bulge. You also get to drive an armored half-track and other such vehicles. If you like first person shooter games, you'll like this game."
2,AMAZING!!,"This CD is now my all time favorite. When Deep Forest made their first album, I totally loved it. Then they made their second.. and though it was good, it missed the deep trance like feeling I got from their first, same with the third and with the Enigma albums... this CD is wonderful! It starts out great and ends awesome! Any fan of Deep Forest, Enigma, Sacred Spirits... you have to own this album... I can express to you how wonderful this cd is! Buy it... you wont regret it!"
2,good album but x-mobs got a better one,great album specially if u like the real underground stuff but if u can buy x-mob paperchasing first. its a down south classic
1,Not her best work,"LOVED Jari's Ripped 1000 and this was a disappointment in comparison. BORING, repetitive, and not as tough. Still a good workout, but definitely not her best."
2,Works great!,"This elliptical is great, I was able to put it together in 1-2 hours. I've had it for 2 weeks and so far works like a charm. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that every time I turn the console on it makes a LOUD beep (by design), which is a problem because I usually workout late at night, when the kids are asleep (loud noises sometimes wake kids up). There is a mute option, but it only works after the console is turned on. Other than that (which is really a minor annoyance) this machine is great!"
1,Somewhat disturbing.,"I started reading this book because the title itself seemed interesting.. The idea of the book seemed good.. The begining was interesting enough, but far too soon did I know who the killer was, and.. well let me sum up the book for you:A female had pepper spray sprayed up her, and her face set on fire.A girl was raped on a stage during a rave.A number of peoples heads are cut offI'm not saying the book was terribly written. It had a few good points, it was an interesting style of writing. It was the extreme vividly explain killing, he went way overboard on explaining each way someone was killed, and the whole pepper spray was a bit.. disturbing."
2,great,been looking for this cd for years since my cassette was destoryedin a house fire. it sounds just as great as it did when it firstcame out. thanks!!!!!
2,A great way to relive Olympic memories,A great way to relive Olympic memories. It's hard to remember the stars of past Olympics unless you go back and review these tapes.
1,"Cliche, cliche, cliche.","While some confusingly bitter reviewers angrily state that the story is ""stolen"" from that horrid show Buffy, I'm afraid the story is Amelia's. It would seem that her talent peaked with her last book, ""Demon in my View"". Honestly, if you want to read more by this author, skip this book and continue on to her fourth one."
1,An Embarassment,"I was sadly disappointed and probably the last time I will ever think of buying her book. Next time I will just save the money and borrow it from the library. there's just no improvement in her writing. This is even more unoriginal then her last two books. It reminds me of a rip off of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I expected more from her. This is garbage, hopefully her next book will be well over the vampire hunter a la witch by then. It be nice to read something not about witches in every book."
2,"Good, not fantastic, but still good.","I loved this book. I truly did, the story was breathtaking and although not as amazing as ""In the Forests of the Night"" it was very well written. The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because of the end of the book which seems rushed. It could have been better but I'd definitely put this on my 2nd favorites list that consist of books I very much enjoyed but didn't love. But I suggest this book for a rainy day I think you'll enjoy it."
2,GOOD Solid Disc,I really Enjoyed This Disc.it had alot of Styles&Flavors going on.Tight Raps&Grooves through out.A Very Underated Group.this Disc is Still Good.
1,Total Crap,"Pitiful book filled with more conjecture than fact. The writer feels the need to skip around Mary and Bonny's stories so that she can throw in tidbits of OTHER pirates' histories as well as her interpretation of what ""might"" have happened. I really hope there's a GREAT book of Anne and Mary out there, cause this ain't it!"
1,waste of time and money,I should have read the reviews a little closer. This is not a Bon Jovi authorized documentary. You can find better discussions on YouTube. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Where is Sue Grafton?,"I was incredibly disappointed in this book. The writing style was not what I was used to in previous books. Gone was the light touch. Instead, the dialog seemed like something out of a grade B romance novel. The usually flowing and descriptive prose was flat and awkward. The humor that is so important to the character of Kinsey was nowhere to be felt. The only way I could finish the book was to pretend that I was reading a novel written by someone else with a character similar to Kinsey. Even then it was hard going. This book made me wonder if,in fact, Sue Grafton wasn't too busy to write it herself and just provided the outline of the plot and characters to someone much younger and less gifted to fill in the details. My advise to a new reader of Sue Grafton is to read all the other books of hers and forget this one exists. You'll love her that way."
1,It was the first I read but...,"This was the first Sue Grafton book read so I went in with an open mind. The writing is drawn out but the mystery is even worse, it seemed all over with nothing really tieing together. I kept waiting for some expose or conclusion. Then the 2 brothers seemed totally pointless. It seemed like they'd tie to the other crime.Maybe it's just because this was my first novel, I got annoyed when half through I realized it was set in 1986. Odd since it was written/published in 2001 and until then all references were as if the story was taking place today. That's her choice I just wish the time frame was specified at the beginning."
2,P=Perfectly different,This is not a typical Kinsey Milhone mystery and unless you are a hard-core Grafton fan you might not like this one. This one has alot of stuff on Medicare and Social Security regs and this can be dull but in Grafton's (Kinsey's) hands it isn't. Best moment when Kinsey realizes she bugging the wrong suspect.
1,THIS JUST IN: KINSEY MILLHONE LOSES HER VOICE!,"I just read L through P in one week. L through O were well told, light, funny, witty and worth the dollars I paid for each of them at the used book store. But P is for Peril marks the first book by Grafton at her new publisher. Grafton evidently forgot to cart along her former editor, who was largely responsible for Kinsey's quirky voice and character.In P is for Peril, Kinsey has lost her voice completely. Grafton has drafted someone new to fill the vast void the last editor filled so well. The voice is now serious, stilted and silly at best.The old Milhone is sorely missed, having died in O. O is for Oh, my, goodness, please bring back Kinsey!P is for Presposterous!Sue evidently has followed the old Lawrence Sanders suit (he had some flunky named Vincent write drivel in Sanders' name) and left the writing to some underling whose voice in no way mirrors Grafton's witty, light and clever one.Goodbye, Sue. You lost a once-dedicated fan...."
1,Entertaining to Awful,"In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written. There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading. Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment. It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book."
1,P is for Pretty Darned Boring,"I have read every book that Sue Grafton has written and looked forward to this latest release. What a disappointment. This book was SO BORING I had difficulty staying awake to finish it. I never did figure out what the entire plot was supposed to be about. And for heaven's sake, who was Anica? I must have dozed off during her first introduction. To sum it up, Despite the fact I bought the hard copy edition, I have no desire to pass it on to anyone else. 1 star is too high of a rating. Shame on you Sue Grafton."
2,Kinsey does it again!,"I bought the unabridged audio book to add to my collection, and I was glad I did. There were maybe a couple of parts where the description of the landscape was a little tiring, but all in all worth the time and money to purchase. Judy Kaye does a great job of reading, and the listener is taken along for the ride with the PI. You will never guess the ending, and yet, there were all the clues all the time. One of the few audio books I listened to twice. Now, I'm wondering what Q will bring, quest, a question or a quary?"
1,"P for ""P U""","The only ""peril"" in this book was the disappointment at the end. I have read A through O and have enjoyed them and was looking forward to this book. What a disappointment! I would not recommend this book...rather turn the TV on and watch another rerun of ""Lavern and Shirley"". If refunds are being given, where do I get in line for mine? Let's hope ""Q"" returns to the quality we expected ""P"" to be."
1,P is for Poop,"I have enjoyed most of Sue Grafton's books, but this one totally disapointed me. Where was the epilogue? I know all books don't wrap up in a nice little package, but hers usually do. I felt I was missing an entire chapter. It was a nice rollercoaster ride that ended in poop."
1,Nasty compilation of good books...,"You're much better off going to the original books this compilation rips off. There are editing mistakes galore in this volume, and the editor adds nothing new (except some typos). I'd sell mine as a used book but I don't want to rip off someone else with this trash."
1,Phenomena II is fantastic music...,"Great songs, great voices, mixed together in a project. Well, i really don't know how to explain what i feel when i listen to this cd. It's just amazing music. Here, in Brazil is almost impossible to find this cd. Thanks amazon.com to have this available..."
2,The Deighton Family produce beautiful sounds,"I played traditional English/Irish music for many years but I can listen to and enjoy anything. What drew me to this group was a snippet of ""Taxman"" that I found on the web when looking for something else. I bought their ""Rolling Home"" (Green Linnet) album on the strength of it and, although I prefer more of the selections on that recording than this one, there are some superlative efforts here. Their version of Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight"", all three Billy Marlowe songs and particularly ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" and ""Taxman"" are extremely well done. They all remind me of the raw, earthy but accomplished output that you could find in many of the pubs and clubs that I used to frequent."
1,Worst than the First,"Saw I had promise and and descended in to a plot mess. Saw II is absurd and not even scary. The basic problem is twofold: 1)Jigsaw as a serial killer is no Hannibal Lector--in fact you almost feel sorry for the poor bastard as Wahlberg beats the crap out of him 2)Killing a bunch of ex-cons does not evoke much empathy. Additionally the ""clever"" trick ending renders the entire movie and plot as absurd and trite. The basic idea behind both of these movies could have provided for some real scares but instead we are treated to a poorly written convulted plot structure that is not even close to being believable. The best serial killer films are very basic and raw--Saw II like Saw I bites off more than it can chew. A waste........"
1,Let's not play anymore little games!,"There are no surprises in this second Saw movie anymore. Again Jigsaw the Great has created a mysterious sadistic masterplan to have his victims appreciate their lives a bit more. This time however watching the movie you simply don't believe the story anymore. I think the first Saw was splendid, but they should not have made a sequel. (SARR)"
1,Announce your spoiler,"The person before me typed a massive spoiler for the movie and didn't feel the need to tell people. Nice job kid. My view of the movie was this. I really liked the first Saw, and HATED this sequel. This movie was more of a teenage slasher movie with grossout, nasty killings without thought behind them. Just ways to maim people. The first movie wasn't just about that, there was plenty of story to keep it going. This just didn't have it. Not recommended."
1,Wow. This movie sucks bad.,"Its about a bunch of people who are locked in a house and die in different ways. No seriously. Thats it. If you enjoy watching people die with a little soap opera plot attempt thrown in....this is for you. Its violent. Big deal. So is Shindler's List and we're not calling that a horror movie, now are we? The JR High kids should love it."
2,Not as good as the first but real close,"The main difference in this movie is Jigsaw. In the first one you didn't know who he was and saw very little of him. In the second you see quite a bit of him. This is both a plus and a negative. On the positive side jigsaw is a very interesting character and is played very well. But on the other hand the mystery of, who is he?, adds something to the first movie that this one is missing. This installment has just as many well thought out traps and Scenario's. And yes at the end you get just as much of a suprise as the first. One other diffence between Saw II and Saw was that in the first one I was able to guess nothing! But in the second I was able to guess one or two things. Nothing major though.If you like the first Saw go rent this one right now!"
1,Saw II DVD,i was very disappointed that the movie did not have a cover and i bought a brand new copy of it
2,If any book should be re-published it is this!,This is the most moving book I have ever read. It is also my wife's favorite book. She spent a significant amount of dollars buying a copy about ten years ago. The writing is good but it is the story that jumps off the page. The author and her family are incredible yet the story is told with extreme modesty. If more people read this book the world would be less egocentric.
2,Great printer.,"This is my first non-HP printer and I am very impressed. The print quality on B&W text seems slightly less than HP, but marginally to the point of ""who cares"". Color comes out wonderfully. However, the best part was the ease of setting it up and the software...including Paper Port. My wife and I both share this printer on a network and the printer and software is designed for use on a network, unlike other products. Very cool. The software is easy to use and simple. Both the printer and software does what it is supposed to do, without all the extra unneeded stuff other manufacturers jam in there. I love this printer...especially for the price."
1,Poor quality and design,"The black ink works after just 18 months, cleaning many times, try ahcohol to clean it, still not working ,had to throw whole set away, very bad product, I will never buy any Brother product again.The design is that when any ink run out, you can not do anyting, and even you do not use, the ink dry itself, (it cleaning every few days by itself, using your inks)."
1,Do not buy this printer,I bought this printer less than a month ago and its already not working right. The paper keeps jamming.The paper tray is jammed and won't come out of the printer. I tried using the other paper feed and I get the same response that the paper is jammed. I wish I had paid attention to the amazon reviewer who mentioned the paper jam problem. This is my first and last time buying Brother.
2,Mind Opening Literature,Becoming me is a wonderful book. As I read it to my children it had me looking at the things around me in a whole new way. Any book that can capture the attention of my children (ages 3 and 5) and have me re-examining the world is fantastic!
2,"Live drums, Live trumpets, Live bass, LIVE FUNK",Amazing. It is one hell of a funky album which includes amazing double bass riffs with stunning blues horns. Lovely !!!!
1,Not a good example of history for students,"While the language isn't boring the the ideas are great in Youngs second edition of this biography, I am not happy at all that my students have been assigned this book to read in a linked course. I teach a study and learning skills course linked to an American history course at a university in the USA and this biography must be read by the students. With all the time spent in the colleges and universities and now in the media about how historians need to cite their sources, this biography is a sad and sorry example. Nothing is cited, even the direct quotes have no citations! Yes, Youngs does discuss his sources at the end of the book but that is not the same as giving credit to the sources where he drew his quotations and facts from. The publisher, Longman, should be ashamed for allowing such poorly cited scholarship to be printed for used in either courses or the general public. I would have given this 1 star but the writing is engaging."
1,How was this so bad?,"This movie had two top stars and a pretty good plot, but somehow turned out horrible! It seems like something went wrong in the editing room because this movie is choppy and seems to jump around without and reason or planning. The ending leaves so much to be desired from a movie that promised a lot. Two stars because of good depiction of war, and the fact that I like Samuel Jackson so much. Ive seen a lot of movies recently and this is by far the worst."
1,How dare you !,A soldier gives the order to shoot on a crowd of civilians (including kids)...lots of dead.And it seems like the director want us to care about the guyUS army self justification at its worst?
1,I'm being generous,"First of all, I have to say that this movie started out quite well. The Vietnam war sequences were intense and stunning, and it immediately grabbed my attention. The film, however, then starts to get shaky after the Colonel (Jackson), is charged with murder for opening fire on a seemingly unarmed crowd of innocent protesting Yemenese civilians. From this point the film turns into a half-baked courtroom drama, then leaves the viewer with a very premature ending. I think it would have been a better decision on the director's part to actually show how the head of National Security was brought down, rather than just writing about it in the end.If you're looking for a great war movie, get ""Saving Private Ryan"", and if you're looking for an intense courtroom drama get ""A Few Good Men"", or ""A Civil Action"""
1,Look elsewhere,"I recently purchased TV SlideShow Studio and spent many hours creating a presentation that would be shown at my daughter's wedding reception. What I found after the effort was that, despite periodically saving my work -- or so I thought -- NONE of my work was saved.Abacus Publishing's Tech Support, after waiting more than a week after I asked how to get a file to save properly, finally responded -- by noting that the problem was apparently known, and the problem would not appear in the upcoming Version 2 of the product. That, of course, did me no good whatsoever; I paid for a product that does not function properly.There are some very nice features in this product and it offers much promise, particularly given its relatively low cost. But if the presentation cannot be saved, what good does any of this do?Look elsewhere if you're seeking software to put together a presentation of your photographs."
1,Overblown Movie About Overrated Singer,"I've always felt that Jim Morrison's death at a young age spared him the humiliation of being unmasked as a mediocre artist and a low-rent character. This movie did nothing to change my view. Kudos to Val Kilmer for a great performance, but Morrison isn't worth all the attention and adulation he has received. His early demise immortalized him and spared him a career flame-out.As comedian Dennis Leary said, ""We don't need a three hour movie about Jim Morrison. I'll tell you his story: I'm drunk, I'm nobody; I'm drunk, I'm famous; I'm drunk, I'm ^%*&%$* dead!"
2,GREAT PICTURE & SOUND!,"(Blu-ray version)For only those, who just like me, when look for a review, they only hope to find technicals opinions, nothing about the movie, history, critical or something like that, so...The picture is great and the sound is great too. Buy it!"
1,Is the Aspect Ratio Correct?,"I picked up this 2 disc 15th anniversary edition (THE ONE WITH THE PURPLE COVER) a couple years ago when it was being blown out new for $6 & just got around to watching it. It's one of those ultra wide & short wide screens, & it seems to me that the tops of people's heads are frequently cut off; I'm wondering if Lions Gate messed up on the aspect ratio during mastering as has happened with a few other films. I no longer have the original version to compare it with, but I strongly suspect this was messed up."
2,Lessons for Life,"I have read this book twice and given it as gifts to several friends who work to make Gospel teachings a model for their everyday lives. There is something here for everyone--joy, sadness, hope. I especially recommend it to those in any profession related to Christian education or the ministry...it should be in every church library."
2,Powerful message on the healing process for all,"This well written book is so helpful. In a unique and open style, Carol Grever shares her moving story and those of 25 other women. It reads like a novel and I did not want to put it down. It has a useful message to all people who have dealt with surprises, changes, and life tramas, not only those who find themselves impacted by a friend coming out of the closet. In openly communicating her struggles in such a heartful way, Carol makes it possible for others to also begin to talk about this previously forbidden topic. I highly recommend this book."
2,Inspirational,"This book is one I share with people who see peace in me and wonder how to get in touch with their own. I have read this book many, many times over the years, especially when I can't remember if I am good person. It really helps me get my heart back in the right place."
2,Power Through Constructive thinking,"Emmet Fox's books are so classic. He is a prolific writer with mystic abilities. I like the simjplicity with which he explains the most of complex mysteries of our universe and creation. His explanations of the writings of Jesus, be it the Lord's Prayer, or the Sermon on the Mount, etc. are profound. That's it...why ruin his incredible insights with my limited vocabulary!"
2,Replacement lawn mower blade,"I needed new blades for my mower, and was finding the right blade difficult.The Maxpower Universal blade fitted well.Delivery time was excellent. Thanks Regards Paul"
2,best yet,i am a big cis fan and have found the 7th season to be the best yet..great directors and story lines..
2,Christina Aguilera!!!!!,"This is a great DVD!!!In this DVD Christina is captured in a concert!!In this concert Christina shows everybody her best shot.She shows everybody why she's a multi-platinum artist.In this concert she sings with her heart.(she always sings with her heart)The best thing 'bout a singer is that they sing with their heart.Christina has a strong,loud,sweet beautiful voice!! GO CHRISTINA!!!!!!"
2,amazing!,christina aguilera is truly a versatile teen star. She can sing and dance very well. this dvd is a sure proof!
2,Truly fascinating stories-even for a guy who's not pregnant!,Shu Shu has really whipped up something great here - a simmering broth of intriguing anecdotes and ancient wisdom cooked to perfection. I couldn't put it down!

1,Unreasonably priced on Amazon,One can buy the same 32 oz Bottle from grocery store for $9.99 thus making a 6 bottle purchase to $59.64 even after paying sales tax it will be much less than $75.36 +shipping. I dont know why would someone buy it from Amazon.
2,Blue Grass/Spiritual,"If you love the religious and blue grass tones, you will love this CD. Iris DeMent gives a wonderful, melodic walk through life's experiences. I loved this CD so much, which was recommended by a family member, I listened to nothing else for days~enjoy!"
1,Know what you might be getting,"Iris Dement has an interesting voice but to me the twang seems a bit exaggerated, almost a caricature of an Appalachian accent. It probably passes well enough in the places where she holds concerts and they don't know any better.But what turned me off the most is her harsh criticism of Christianity and clearly hard left politics. If you are a Christian and enjoy listening to someone scoffing at your beliefs then this might be your music. If you are a communist or socialist then this is definitely your music - songs that Trotsky would love.I'm disappointed really. I wanted to like Iris Dement after listening to Our Town but I just couldn't stomach all the progressive drivel in her music."
2,The Bee Gees Biggest Studio Album!,"In the difficult position of having to top ""Saturday Night Fever"", the Gibb brothers surpassed themselves and created their biggest hit studio album of their careers, including three more #1 hits, making six #1 hit songs in a row! ""Tragedy"", ""Too Much Heaven"" and ""Love You Inside Out"" were all top hit singles. ""Spirits (Having Flown)"" was a large hit single overseas. All songs are Barry dominated vocals and he is at his falsetto best. However, ""Stop (Think Again)"" is a tad long and a little bit tedious, but the following tracks go right back to their upbeat best! Succeeding in avoiding any dance songs (disco), the Bee Gees out-do themselves. These songs are truly funky ""R & B"" numbers, a solid match for any rythym and blues band. ""Until"", the closing solo track may not be equal to their earlier hit ""Words"", but Barry's voice accompanied by the electronic harpsichord makes for a delicious ending."
2,A Book for Coaches and Parents,"This book is an easy and enjoyable read; at times you even find yourself smiling at the examples Michael Stabeno uses to illustrate his points. The book is comprehensive as it discusses what ADHD is, common misconceptions of ADHD, communication and coaching strategies, the implications of medication, and parenting tips for the athlete. I appreciated the discussion on perceiving common behavior traits of ADDers as assets rather than liabilities for the athlete. The strategies and tactics he provides are common sense and easily applied. As a parent of a child with a head injury who presents with ADHD-like symptoms, I have found the communication and coaching tips very applicable to life skills...getting ready for school, completing homework or chores. The information is straightforward, thought provoking and useable! I recommend it to all parents and coaches who interact with ADDers of any age."
2,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"I receieved this novel today, and from the moment i picked it up i didn't put it down until i finished it, bar from a real inconvient exam. But on to the novel, the way the story is written is brilliant just the way it propels you into the story its as if your taking a back seat. a very good read! can't wait to see it on the big screen."
2,A wondeful toy...,"It is an awesome toy to have your kids doing more exercise and to train their connection between eyes and hands. The stand and the basket ring are very strong. The adjustable height is so easily to change. No problem at all for assembly. I am putting the toy indoor in the living room for my 3-yr and 2-yr kids, but definitely will move outdoor once they have grown up. In addition, it is a wonderful toy that I can play with my kids while I can also enjoy it. It is also worth to mention that when I am watching NBA games, my kids always try to mimic what they have seen in the play and try to do the dunk or shoot. It is so much of fun. Really a good buy."
2,3 Year Old Grandson,I purchased this for my 3 year old grandson's birthday. He along with his older brothers are having a fun time with it. It is much sturdier than the smaller ones that the older boys had. I like the fact that it is adjustable so it will grow with him and be usable for a few years.
2,Lots of information,"This book is great for including the many different ways families come together. Adoption, step-parents, single parents and other types of families are included. This book is very inclusive and leaves room for all situations.It is full of facts for helping to explain how babies are made to our children."
1,Save your money...,"I purchased this item last year. The first one wasn't even completely assembled. The water leaked out all over the counter and floor. My husband took it apart and the hoses weren't attached. It made ice once and I returned my new unit to Sunpentown for another. That one worked for several months without a problem. Then the ""needs water"" light kept coming on and it would not make ice. I did just read on another site review that if you tip it backwards, sometimes that will help. They should enclose that info in the instructions. I finally gave it away on freecycle. I love the concept of this appliance, but would like to find one that worked without have to do rocket surgery."
2,Great book for young children,"This is a great little book for working with young children, who have a hard time talking about their feelings. The removeable stickers allow for the child to interact and express their own feelings over and over again. I also have enjoyed other books in this series that deal with other emotions."
1,Hard to Use,"Purchased this for use with the New LG Chocolate phone. Downloaded the updates needed to use it with the new phone. So far have been unable to do anything with it. Will continue to try, but would not recommend it based on my experience. Easier to have the service provider do the phonebook transfers and pay to download the ringtones."
1,Don't bother,"With punk and new wave firmly in control in 1979, so called ""progressive rock"" was well out of vogue and excruciatingly unhip. In this climate, Renaissance was struggling for ""relevance"" and this album was its woefully misguided attempt and reclaiming it.Gone were the grand orchestral arrangements that had marked previous albums and it its place were a group of songs drowned in an overproduced synthesizer mess. What was worse was that few if any of the songs even hinted and being memorable. It was not just the way they were presented it was the content of the songs themselves. This was the album that pretty much put the band to rest. After several previous unfocused efforts, their already dwindling fan base all but dried up. A sad whimpering end to a once compelling band."
2,Excellent thin and light laptop desk,"This is an excellent thin and light laptop desk that I have used for years with both 13"" and 15"" laptops. I have taken it with me traveling, used it in airports, on flights, and at home. It has held up well and is still as good as new. It lifts a laptop keyboard to a position for easier typing and shields my skin from laptop heat dissipation. Recommended."
2,My Daughter (Age 3) Loves This Book,"I never tire of reading this book with my daughter. Me and My Amazing Body has inspired many conversations about the human body and health. It is simple, educational and the illustrations are great."
1,Very Creepy Illustrations,"The text of this book is okay, but the illustrations are very creepy. Each aspect of the body is illustrated on the body of the girl telling the story. It is very odd looking."
2,THE EAGLES - HELL FREEZES OVER,"The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DVD is the next best thing to being at The Eagles 1995 Hell Freezes Over Concert! I was at the then, Great Woods, now Tweeter Center, in Mansfield, Mass., to see the 1995 concert which was great! If you weren't an ""Eagles"" fan before, you will be, after watching this DVD. There's just so many great songs, from the earlier ones like, ""Take It Easy"" and ""Hotel California"", to the newer songs like, ""Get Over It"", and ""Love Will Keep Us Alive"". The Eagles are one of the most talented bands of our times and the ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD really displays that talent. The songwriting, the singing, and the instrumentals, are like no other band out there, and one will truly enjoy watching and listening to this DVD!"
2,"A must buy...but not a DTS ""demonstration"" dvd!","A really enjoyable concert! It is nice to see and hear the Eagles again! My only complaint, however, is that alot of the guitar solos are mixed too low on this dvd. On Hotel California, the lead guitars are almost absent and the base line is way too loud! Anybody else notice this? I would still recommend this dvd...but it is not the best DTS demonstration...except for the last cut ""Seven Bridges""...which is DTS perfect! If anyone else has experienced the above problem with hearing the lead guitar solos..drop me a line!"
2,Best all round music DVD,I've collected about 20 music DVDs from various artists.This one is still the best.Each song is well known--there are no filler songs. Also the use of DTS and the individual speakers is very well done. In many songs different voices or instruments are recorded onto different speakers. It is not gimmicky but instead is very smooth and pleasing.The artists look very emotional as they sing. That's nice to see.The little one minute DTS surround sound demo as you start the DVD is very impressive too.
1,good if your diehard into them,"If you have all their albums, know all their lyrics, then maybe this is for you, but if your like me, and have heard about 5-6 of their radio songs throughout your life, then you might not like their other stuff. I thought this was WAY SLOW! And way boring. ZZZZZzzzzzzz Not only were the songs soppy slow, but the band was too: they sat on chairs! This reminded me of one of the bad bands you see playing in a casino bar lounge at 2:30 am in the morning in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, slow is not always bad, For example, I think fleet wood mack is way better at this genre. This is just sick, bring a pillow"
1,5.1 ADVICE,Be careful when ordering this DVD. It is recorded in either DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1. Make sure your RECEIVER processes DTS otherwise buy the Dolby Digital version. Most all DVD players read and send a DTS & Dolby Digital signal to your receiver but make sure your receiver processes DTS and/or Dolby Digital before you make your decision. I have the DTS version but no DTS processer and had to select the enhanced stereo setting. On the other hand the sound is still impressive. So far no other DVD I've purchased compares in overall quality. I'm convinced this is the best way to enjoy music. I've stopped buying CDs and only buy music DVDs now. I'm waiting for my old classics to be re-mixed to 5.1 sound with some clips from concerts.
2,This is all I expected !!!,"I bought this with FleetwoodMac's ""Dance"" yesterday. This one blown FM away! It has all the best songs of Eagles in their original 'form' (the way I like it). And the Video/Audio is simply fantastic !Two Thumb's up up up ...."
2,A must have for an Eagle's fan!!!!,By far this is the BEST DVD concert.I have seen the Eagles just recently in Denver and this is just as good if not better.
2,Music The Way It Should Be !,"What an amazing production. As a professional musician,I can greatly appreciate the efforts made to produce such a fantastic quality DVD. The Eagles are so talented and provide a tight rendendition of their music. Easily worth the price!"
2,Good show!,"This is a great show and fun to watch! I thought the concert/tour was pretty good and this video captures the band at a critical time when they were getting their ""act"" together...worth the money and multiple watches and a great addition to the collection!"
2,Better than being there,"This video only has one DTS encoded track (bonus)and any of the other cuts would make it worth buying. From ""Take It Easy"" to ""New York Minute"" the concert takes were clean, tight and amazing to watch. My only disappointment is that they left off ""Lying Eyes"". Maybe they'll record another!"
1,Not a Good One at All!,"This was perhaps the absolute worse Jonathan Kellerman going!I have read at least two-thirds of his novels most of which are quite pleasing and entertaining, some more wierd than others...Not good at all! Really!At any rate, I agree completely ( as does my wife), who feels as did a recent reviewer; it would be incredibly fantastic to find that this novel was not something from his distant past, that was now thrown in for a quick hit....It was formal, unlike any other of his novels, truly BORING X 10, and we barely got through it on a relaxing summer vacation.Both of us felt it was just terrible at best! Rent it on audio book at the library, that way you can stand the horribly slow plot culminating in a relatively exciting (much needed) ending...."
1,Kellerman is getting worse with experience,"Look, if you want to read a good mystery, stick to Kellerman's early work. ""Butcher's Theater"" is dynamite. This one is pretty darned close to a remake (at least in terms of the villian's MO), but nowhere as imaginative or intriguing. It's time for Kellerman to retire his word processor."
2,New character I hope to see more of,"As an avid fan of the Delaware series, I was thrilled to read a stand alone book of Kellermans that was a gripping story. I often find with authors of this genre that when they depart from their usual characters, their writing leaves much to be desired. Kellerman, however, does not disappoint - but regular readers will feel that the main character is not that dis-similar to Alex Delaware. I enjoyed this book, and would like to see Jeremy developed more in future novels - having said that - I am looing forward to reading the new Delaware book as soon as it is available."
1,Far from the standard of the Delaware series...,"Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and ""traveling and learning"" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city."
1,Still Disappointed,"I've been a long-time fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have noticed his books steadily declining regarding plot, interest, and entertainment value. I was hoping ""The Conspiracy Club"" would bring him out of the rut he seems to have fallen into, but for me, this book only proves he has run out of motivation or has become bored with writing.I am beginning to wonder when the publishing world will grow tired of continually feeding to the reading world mundane works from formerly best-selling authors (i.e. Cornwell, Patterson, Clancy, Kellerman, et.)and instead focus on more talented, unknown authors. Come on, New York, listen to the readers who are expressing their opinions!"
1,"this is the WORST JK book -- if you are a fan, don't buy it","This is BY FAR the worst Jonathan Kellerman book ever. I have been reading JK for over 10 years and have read almost every book of his. This book moved SO slow and he spent too much time building up characters that were not integral to the plot or at least not the murder mystery plot part. He spent more time building a love relationship between the main character and his girlfriend than he did solving the crime.1 word: BORING! If you are a fan of JK, don't buy this one. It has strayed too far from his main type of storyline."
1,defective copy,"i just received my copy of this book from amazon. it is clearly defective. the editor's introduction has been left out completely, and probably about half the pages of the text itself are missing. amazon should do a recall of this book, assuming the other copies out there are the same."
1,Definatly Not A Favorite,"This is the first Hemingway I've read and I have to say that I was disapointed. I did like the scenes with the boy and the old man but that was about it! But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book. As one reviewer said, ""The story line was dragged on..."". That sums up exactly how I felt about the book. When I learned it won a Pulizer I was even more surpirsed. When I talked to other people they felt that he deserved a Pulizer for his other books and maybe they just gave him the Prize because they felt they needed to. I'm not sure and I'm probably wrong. To me, it seems that you either loved it, or hated it. I've talked to people who think this is the best book ever and I've talk to people who didn't like it at all."
1,This book isn't worth the paper it's written on !,"Santiago, an old fisherman, is the main character in the dreadfully boring book The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The short, choppy sentences ruin the plot which is Santiago trying to catch a fish.If you haven't read this book yet, then don't. You're not missing anything. The main and only real conflict is that he's an old man and he hasn't caught a fish in almost 3 months.This book couldn't possibly be at all interesting. However, if your trying to die of boredom this is the book for you. If you do choose to read this book, may the force be with you"
1,the case for illiteracy,"Telltale sign of an idiot: they like this bookBukowski, a literary radical, says of 'Old Man': this f*'n blows.Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and his short stories are for the most part excellent works, but contrary to popular (e.g. stupid, wrong) perception he never did regain his craft.I have never exaggerated anything in my life, and the single most embarrassing instance in the history of letters was the awarding of the pulitzer in '53 and nobel prize for lit in '54 to this novella. This work is the single greatest justification for suicide.Overall Hemingway (the drunkard) is an overrated bum. The louse stole his much copped prose from Sherwood Anderson ('Winsburg, Ohio' humiliates anything Hemingway ever hacked out) and Gertude Stein (no one cares about this broad...).Negative infinity stars."
2,Not the best book for school.,"I had to read this book for a school project, and it wasn't the best choice. Yes, it's short, but it's also very slow and not very interesting. If you have to choose between this one, and another, pick the other, because this book just isn't a good choice to do a project on. If you're reading it just because, then go ahead, it's easy to understand."
1,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to read this acclaimed book but in honesty, was just disappointed by it. Not that the writing style isn't good, not that the story isn't interesting. Yes, as many critics say, the book touches on many topics of human personalities, flaws and qualities. But when they say ""touch on"", that's really all it is. If you are looking for insights, for inspiration in any of these topics, I think you are better off reading Herman Hesse. So much that it's clear to me that the level of awareness that Hemingway had was quite lower than that of Hesse. Where Hemingway saw that there was more to man than his action and thoughts, Hesse saw emotions, yearning and melancholy.Perhaps 50 years ago, with the level of consciousness society had, this was a good novel. But today, the main value of this book is the details of fishing at the time."
2,Possibly the most depressing ending ever,"I'll make this short.This was a short, quickly read book and a very worth while read. The old man is very admirable.I enjoyed the book and understood why it had to end the way it did but still left me feeling like some one had punched me in the stomach.Read it, it was good but depressing."
1,It is wasting time to read this book,"There is nothing in this book, but the author could write more than 100 pages to tell you nothing."
1,feet or old man?,"I just have a brief comment on this so-called ""legendary"" American novel. It has been a while since i read the fun little book, so it might deserve a second glance. Nonetheless, i'd like to say that in my opinion, one should be able to remain awake during a ""good"" book. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case with Old Man And the Sea. Though it's symbolic references may be partially interesting, what is the use of a book if it can't even keep you awake or inspired. Simplicity may be able to be used to an advantage in some cases, but i found that in Old Man and the Sea, the attempt was a flailing and defeated one. I won't criticize Hemingway himself because i have yet to read his other novels, but i must say this was a particularly big dissapointment. Authors hitting closer to home to being ""legendary"" american novels would be Kerouac or even Fitzgerald."
2,"Dope-a-scope, this book ganks","This book totally ganks. It is so gripping and so simple. It uses plain old fashioned techniques of good storytelling. I don't mean ganks like the typical ""Let's gank a forty from the local liquor store,"" rather, it ganked my attention, stealing it from all the mass media with which it struggles today. Don't get me wrong, I've read better, but for such a short simple book, this one totally ruled. Enjoy it."
2,A True Classic,"The Old Man and the Sea is one of the most elegant stories ever written. I have read it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times. The writing has such grace and is so refined and perfect that I could not possibly imagine any sentence being rewritten for the better. The story is wonderful, and, like all great tales, it works on many levels. This is the best book Hemmingway ever wrote, the truest, the most well written. I know I will be reading it again and again throughout my life."
2,"Fascinating, quick read",It took me a few hours to finish. Who knew a great book could be written in so few pages?
2,Great book...,"This book is short, but very good. It was made into a movie, starring Spencer Tracy, which is also very good. You will enjoy this book."
2,It captured my interest for a book I would normally pass up,"Over the last few months, I had the pleasure of reading Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. I found the book extremely easy, fast reading, and interesting. The constant struggles of Santiago were particularly interesting in the way it was described. Not only could you get the sense of what he was feeling, but also you felt as if you were in the boat alongside him. Where others may find his time at sea drawn out and uninteresting, I thought it only added to the fascinating complex and personality of the book itself. Even though I am a strict science fiction reader, I found that this book captured my attention and kept me turning the pages."
1,It's boring,"First of all, I wouldn't recommend buying this edition of the book because they couldn't even spell the author's name correctly.Regarding the book itself, I remember dragging myself through the pages as a high school freshman and asking myself why I had to end up with the only teacher who chose The Old Man and the Sea over Of Mice and Men. I recognized the metaphors about life, but I didn't care because the story just wasn't engaging. Eat raw dolphin, pee over the side of the boat, pull the fish. Rinse and repeat.I thought maybe re-reading it as an adult might change my perspective, but no. It's still boring. I didn't even finish it this time. I don't care what deeper message the story contains, I'm not going to read it if I have to fight to stay awake. If you want to read a good book by Ernest Hemingway, try A Farewell to Arms."
2,The book is short but it tells about fisherman's worth life.,"Book reviewMy book review is about old man and the sea. It tells you about what is fisher men, who are they, what they do. The main character is old man, his name is Santiago. He was a fisher man, long time ago when he start the fisher man. There was one boy who helped him fishing. But boy leave him because Santiago didn't get fish for about eighty days and the boy's parents told boy don't work with Santiago. But boy change the boss, the boy can get fish every day. One side Santiago can't get any fish, so he went to get more far away. He got more and he returned home."
1,Not very impressive,"Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea has been given A LOT of praise since it was written. Given the task of reading a book by an American author for a high school english class, I decided to give it a whirl, with such publicity it must be worth the read, right? After about 50 pages I came to the conclusion that it was one of the most boring books I had ever read. I guess I'm just a sucker for rich detail, which Hemingway completely overlooks. addcaptivating...it was just plain dull. Why the world calls this novella an essential work of American Literature I'll never know."
2,Life as it is,"I am amazed at the simplicity of this book, sometimes Hemingway speaks in parable and sometimes he expresses the inner thought of the characters.I specially liked the struggle to catch the fish, because of what it meant to the old man. The fight to catch this fish lasted 3 days, not giving up!It is a journey filled with hope and fear, struggle and defeat, death and life.It is a must read! But mainly a ""Must have book"", because I believe it should be read more than once and every once in a while."
2,Exceptional,"A great, simple tale of a man at sea. Brimming with Hemingway's brilliant symbols, this short novel is a must read.After reading it, I couldn't help but feel that the fish represented Hemingway's writing. Reading it gave me the feeling that after the critical failure of his last novel, Hemingway felt as the old man: Tired, alone, but struggling with his art. The sharks seem to vividly recapture the vicious criticisms shot at Hemingway from all sides following his most recent defeat.By the time the old man(and Hemingway) reach shore, there is nothing left but a few tales for the villagers. It is telling that Hemingway never wrote another novel after this one."
2,Very helpful,"I understand my daughter's hair-pulling problem much better after reading this book. I never knew it was exacerbated by chastising or threatening. I have focused much more on helping her ease the tension, like massaging her scalp or cuddling with her. It also helps her to exercise her fine motor skills, like working with beads and making bracelets, etc. This book has helped us so much!!!"
2,A very excellent item to own...,"This book should be read by every woman and every straight man. A very helpful guide that says systematically what you wish had been explained (in such an enjoyable way) from the beginning. It covers the very simple to the more advanced, is a very easy and enjoyable read, has lots of pictures and diagrams, and also features quotes from people giving insight from personal experience. Although female sexuality can be a difficult thing to lasso and understand, this book simplifies it and makes it very...enjoyable. As I said, a very excellent item to own."
1,cute but about easter,"My son likes this DVD, but I wouldn't have bought it had I known it was about Easter--would have been helpful info before buying!"
2,classic,"I,ve been waiting and hoping this would become available. A real LIVE club sound, this is the kind of music that was heard all over in ""The Village"" Coffee Houses & Bars."
1,Hesitant to buy,"I am glad to hear I am not the only one who is driven crazy by the way she repeats the same things over and over again. It truly makes me not want to read her books. After reading the other readers' reviews, I have decided not to buy. I can do without the frustration."
2,Great but too pricey!,"The 2nd cd is what many fans have been waiting for--to have all the singles in one place! Still, the cd is too pricey, seeing that many double cds now only cost about 18 dollars. Still, how can you resist? I give it a four b/c of the price. A 5 otherwise!!!"
2,Now this is pop rock from Def Leppard,"You know, looking at the reviews on Pyromania, most everyone writes about how it's a great pop metal album, pop rock this and that. In comparison to this album, Pyromania is hard rock and roll, and Hysteria is a radio friendly, songs easily accessible for singles, lite metal, pop rock. Yeah, there are some great songs on here...but it just seems this band went balless after this release. I mean Women, Love and Affection, Love bites, come on...is this a Def Leppard album or Bon Jovi?!? Oh well, Rocket, Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It, Hysteria are all great tracks in between stuff that unfortunately would turn the band into pusses in about 4 years"
2,Eighties classic,"I rarely listen to Side Two, but they could have packaged the first side together, thrown in ""Hysteria"" and released the greatest album ever made. I won't complain about the other songs from the second side, like ""Gods of War"", ""Don't Shoot Shotgun"" or ""Love and Affection"", but after a run of singles like the first side...well, who could still breathe after a flawless run like that? Amazing album, one of the best of the Eighties, and the best for any frat party (not that I'd know, of course...)."
1,One Arm away from no stars...,"If you like over produced, slick MTV hair metalpop with band members who have strategically placed tears in their jeans this is for you. Me? I'll listen to Jane's Addiction's ""Nothing Shocking"" instead."
2,An absolute classic.,"It's true that this album wasn't as ""metal"" as those before it, but that didn't stop it from being their best and most popular album. I like the early stuff too, right back to ""On Through The Night"", but this is easily tops. Half of this disc is pretty much singles, hence six of these songs are on their ""Greatest Hits"" album. Included is ""Women"", ""Animal"", ""Love Bites"", and the still often heard ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"". One of my favorite tracks by far, which never seems to be mentioned by anyone, is ""Gods Of War"". That song is awesome. Only a few albums from this genre are close to being this great, those are ""5150"", ""Dr. Feelgood"", and ""Appetite For Destruction"". All of them should make you ""Def""."
2,Def Leppard's Best,"Loads of chart-topping songs on this album, plus more good tracks that most people aren't even familiar with. It is still a great album even after 20+ years."
2,Not to be without!,"There really isnt more than you can say about this musical masterpiece. This is the quintisential heavy metal album from the 1980s, and, one of the best of all time. If you are a rock and roll fan, and do not have this album, you really arent that much of a rock and roll fan!"
2,Item picture not exactly what you get,"I got my new CD Walkman yesterday; opened it this morning. It plays great, etc., but my disappointment is that the headphones do not have the remote on their cord as depicted in the item picture. Nor do they come with batteries included, which is what the other item is I think in the picture. I don't need a lot of the other stuff that came in the package (I have no interest in the car pack) but I do think the photo of the item you are purchasing should be a more accurate one. But otherwise, an excellent product for the money. That is why the 4-star rating instead of 5."
2,what are they talking about,have they even listened to the albumgreat recordnot a sophmore slump thats for surei can set my cd player to random and be happy all daynot a song on the album that i dislike
2,"Good quality, reasonable price",I bought this for my daughter to use bug hunting and exploring in the yard. It's sturdy and solidly constructed. I'll probably buy another to add to my emergency/camping gear.
2,My daughter's favorite book for two years!,"This is a fantastic book! Someone gave it to my daughter when she was a baby, and from the time she was about 9 months old until she was two-and-a-half, she would bring this book to us every day for us to read to her. I didn't mind reading it so often, becuase there are gorgeous illustrations. Some of the poems and lullabies were unfamiliar to me before, but they are charming. I've been giving this book as a baby gift myself for years now. You can't go wrong with this book!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I won't go into the details of the plot itself. The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that. I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it. This book moves very slowly. There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that? There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts. The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting, exciting people. But, they are cliches. The completely evil villain; the sad, ever moral good guy. And they talk and talk and talk. Until the last third of the book, there is virtually no action in this supposed thriller. If you want a fast paced novel with vivid characters, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,pompeii,"If you are expecting a well-crafted, literary historical novel (regarding the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in ancient Greece), you will be disappointed. this book seems to have been designed for a mass audience. the plot of this book is not very imaginative or interesting and the prose is annoyingly slick. Finally, there is neither much detail regarding the history of ancient greece nor to volcanology, either of which might have provided more redeeming value for this book."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Dull and dopey. (And I'm someone who generally *likes* sheik romances!) Unless you're a sheik-romance enthusiast who simply must own every Rudolph Valentino retread to roll down the highway, I'd say save your money on this one."
1,A very tedious book,"I truly wanted to read The Pride, so much that I forced myself to get through half the novel before I abandoned it. Mr. Ford writes lovely prose and can turn a phrase. Unfortunately, this novel is bogged down with tedious character development and a plodding storyline. It takes the first hundred pages or so to get several characters to a decedent's memorial service. Then, the next 1/3 of the book is spent over a luncheon meeting. Before the lunchgoers had finished their meal, I was completely tired of them and their business deliberations. I had no interest in continuing."
2,*powerful*,This sermon is excellent. If you have ever heard of what happened while this sermon was preached (viz.-people yearning to get saved no matter what the cost) then you will understand why they did after you read it. :)
1,What happened to GRACE?,I believe the editor has missed the mark and failed to properly address what the Gospel is all about .... grace. The editor is obviously young and without enough life experience to know how to write the TRUTH. It is a shame that Christians must be fed misinformation by individuals who do not know what they are talking about. It is only by grace that we can come to Him ... the rest is irrelevant.
2,Good Book,Product description was a little off however overall a great product and arrived very fast
1,Gross.,"I like all kinds of Power Bars, Balance bars, Odwalla, Premier Bars. Just don't like the taste of Chocolate Chocolate Chunk."
1,Stored in a hot warehouse?,"Ordered in December, but all the bars appear to have melted in the package at some point in their history. They re-hardened in a mixed mess and tasted OK, though, so I'm not returning them. They're just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition, so I'm giving two stars. Check the images to see what my bars looked like."
2,Not quite as tasty as the rest of the line,"These bars have the perfect mix of carbs and protein that I look for in a meal replacement bar, but unlike the rest of the bars in this line I found the taste and consistency a little off for my tastes. Still a great meal replacement bar for the cost."
1,Psalms as drama for drama's sake not Psalm's sake,"The Psalms in Worship is a selection of Psalms or Psalm parts divided to be read by leader and congregation, by two voices, by chorus and solo voices ... etc. While I am fond of antiphonal Psalm repetition and while Psalm scholarship has shown that some Psalms are intended to be done in various voices, I fail to see how the divisions proposed by the authors of this volume enhance or emphasis the meaning and structure of the Psalm.The final section of this book includes responsories based on Psalms which are well done. For example a call to worship based on Psalm 34:3 has the leader say ""Glorify the Lord with me"" to which the people respond ""Let us exalt his name together"".I do not, however, find this portion sufficient to justify recommending the book."
1,Text missing between p58 and 59,"I had to buy this book under duress (one of those lecturer/author situations at uni), and was very disappointed to find that there is text and bullet points missing - the pages are in the right order 58,59,etc. But the bottom of p58 does not correspond with the top of p59. Crap printing as well. Look elsewhere if you have to buy this book."
1,Nothing but Feminazi Rage,"I'm getting married next year, and I've read alot of books related to marriage and planning weddings, and this was the worst waste of them all. The author spends the whole book ranting about what 'our' mothers did wrong and how modern women should all be bit- I mean witches like her. She never talks about finding what's right for yourself, you either worship Norwood, or you belong in your mothers generation and are doomed to pain misery. In Norwood's world their seems to be no possibility of compromise, it's his way or hers. She blames the disruption of the '50s family on 'his way' and praises 'her way' as the path to success. Total self-centered spoiled princess BS. This woman is an conceited idiot, and this book is a waste of time and money."
1,Double-sided for the same subject-why?,"Like the other reviewer said they are double-sided which would be fine if what was on the back was a completely different subject but it's the same (half the months are on one side, half on the other and the same with the days of the week, etc.) so you can never look at all of the subject at one time. Otherwise, it's a good idea."
1,Barely worth the inexpensive price.,"This book barely provides the entertainment value of what it costs to purchase. The photos themselves are haphazard with little artistic value. There are some interesting graphic design elements to this book but they are few. Overall, a disappointment..."
2,"""I Say Nothing"" is worth the CD price, all by itself.","I remember hearing ""I Say Nothing"" on the car radio FM (out of Baja) when I was stationed up at Camp Pendleton, and the choruses/refrains hooked me instantly. It's one of those tracks on which a band does almost everything just right. I've since made it a point to hear most everything else that VoB has done, and ""I Say Nothing"" has a rare pop magic that you see (or rather hear) once in a blue moon. I would have paid $10 for a CD single of that tune."
1,doesn't work,"I bought this book for my kindle touch but it won't download! I really wanted to read it because it sounded interesting. Sincerely , Your Would Have Been Customer"
1,WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had heard that Kim was one of the best books of all time. Had to wait 2 months for library to acquire it.Have never been so disappointed in anything. Cults, voodoo, spells, magic, demonic activity, caste system, blasphemy, abuse, violence, superstition, humanism (worship of certain humans), depression, ... UGH!!WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! DON'T BOTHER READING THIS."
1,The only Dagliesh book I do not like,"I am a huge fan of PD James and Adam Dagliesh, but this book just did not work for me. The characters were unappealing, the plot was unbelievable. I normally love mysteries that are slow-paced and build to a climax, and normally you can count on PD James for this type of mystery, but not this time. The book was boring, by the end I found myself wishing I hadn't wasted my time. It was so disappointing."
2,One of the finest movies I have had the pleasure of viewing,"This is a movie to take the kids to and the grandparents as well. As heartwarming and real as anything I have seen. Living near Cincinnati, I was curious as to the locale shots, but most seem to be on the money. The book Freak The Mighty this was taken from is just as interesting and entertaining. One of the few movies to do justice to a book"
1,Lousy,"""Crocodile Rock"" is surely one of the most annoying tunes ever to hit the radio, and it is the main hit on this album. OK, ""Daniel"" was also a hit, and is tolerable, but the rest of this album reeks. Elton John is vastly overrated."
2,My first and favorite!,"This was the first Elton John album I bought and it remains to this day my favorite. Yes, I had a vinyl album, and for some reason never moved to the cassette or CD. After buying this CD and singing along once again, I realized that it did indeed stand the test of time. Elton's melodies and piano-playing and Bernie Taupin's lyrics stand out. I know that ""Honky Chateau"" is considered by many to be a finer effort, but I just like every song on ""Don't Shoot Me"". In fact, several of the songs that weren't released as singles seem to me stronger efforts."
1,Sadly inaccurate,"The historical accuracy of this book is sadly lacking.If you don't think the Confederacy (and therefore its symbol) was built on racism and slavery, read the Cornerstone Speech of Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederate States here: http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 .According to Stephens himself on March, 21, 1861, ""The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution - African slavery as it exists amongst us - the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution."""
2,horse treats,Colorful and the horse loved all of them! Nice small package for travel. It was wonderful to have them so small for a horse on a diet but rewarding for the horse. Each piece is imprinted which is way cute.
2,First Class,A first class performance by a great lady. For anyone who's never listened to Classical or Opera before then Leontyne Price is well worth listening to.
2,Intelligent and Challenging,"This is one of books most interesting and challenging books I've ever read. It is enjoyable and the writing style is wonderful. However, the ideas are what I most enjoyed. Whether you agree or disagree with Lenin, this book is an important marker in modern political analysis. Personally, I loved it and find myself returning to it often for clarity and inspiration."
1,"Boring , Obvious and predictable",I was very disappointed with this listenandlive title. All the advice and tips are so obvious and just statements of common sense. In fact many things seem contrived and the advice given does not seem practical at all. A lot of it is obsolete like the chapter about emails.
2,Another fine tale from McMurtry,"I laughed and I cried. Now that he's read the book, my 62 year old husband calls me Karla and I call him Duane. We just follow McMurtry around like Shorty. About anything he writes is o.k. with us."
2,Keep another McMurtry novel on hand after this one.,"After reading All My Friends are Going to be Strangers, I wanted to read more of McMurtry. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of westerns and didn't know much about any of his other novels. I chose Duane's Depressed after reading the back cover, and was incredibly impressed. I especially enjoyed the beginning chapters and the dialogue of the children. But I thought the novel faltered after the death of Karla, and the reasons for his not becoming involved with Honor were unusual and questionable. I also wondered why he desired to see Egypt, of all places. All in all, a wonderful novel, and I will continue to read McMurtry and follow Danny Deck in the sequels to All My Friends, but I was disappointed with the ending to this novel."
1,Read Everything Else First,"Lonesome Dove is one of my favorite books of all time and I have enjoyed all of his other books (Terms of Endearment, Comanche Moon, Buffalo Girls, Anything for Billy, Streets of Laredo, etc) however I had trouble finishing Duane's Depressed. The first half of the book rolled along but the second half became unbearably slow. I felt like I was reading a character study by James Joyce.This book did not have the memorable characters characteristic of McMurtry novels. Imagine Lonesome Dove being a character study of Woodrow Call, it certainly would not win a Pulitzer. Maybe I prefer the Lonesome Dove saga better. I still recommend this book to those who love the Texasville series but for first time Larry McMurtry readers, try reading Lonesome Dove or Terms of Endearment before you read this book."
2,Best Sounding Speakers For The Bucks,"These speakers can't be beat for the price! The lows,mids, and highs all come thru with nice clarity. I use these in my living room for DVD's, CD's and the TV cable signal audio. I'd recommendthese speakers for anyone looking for good quality sound at a low price. Nice job KLH!!!!"
2,the duality of business and politics explained,"A timely book for the current election, Jacobs describes the complementary, yet different systems that humans have devised for the political and commercial spheres.Using a conversational format among a set of characters, the duality is made clear, revealing the opposing rules for each. It serves as a cautionary tale for anyone who wishes to cross over from one to another: beware, what worked previously will precisely not work in the next!"
2,Great ideas!!,"I bought this book for my Masters class and absolutely love it. It has so many great ideas in it for teachers and parents. I think all preschool, pre-k and kindergarten teachers should own this book. Its very easy to read and even has pictures!!!"
2,Heartbeats and Heartaches,"This is a biography based on actual account typify of most intellectual Chinese from PRC. From nationalism, to communism many scholars endured difficult times couping with constant political unrests and made the most of their lifes. Professor Qin kept most of the difficult times to her self and moved on with her family. Those with great tolerance accept what was given and try to move on... An excellent book highly recommended."
2,Be My Valentine,"Be My Valentine is a fast, sassy time travel romance set in contemporary New Zealand and Port Royal, the ""Sin City"" of Jamaica, in the year 1692. I liked the characters and the setting, which includes a shipwreck - waking up surrounded by pirates on a deserted island; and the interesting plot made it a really good read."
2,durn burn it Paw....,"Dad-blame goodun' we made. And it is now on this new-fangled CD technology! ggjaskgsk Stop messin' with my keyboard, Joe, or I'll tell Hopsing that you been bad."
2,A review for GREGG's Shorthand: Dictation and Transcription,"This book is great and all, the only problem is, you have to make sure you know the words in shorthand already. This book doesn't waste any time and goes straight to the transcription, but that may not be so good for new users. Other than that, this book is great and really goes indepth with the way to transcipt your shorthand notes."
2,Very well written,"One of the best as far as romance novels. Very well written with a very moving plot. Basically, the hero and heroine meet briefly before the hero suffers what seems to be a hemorrhagic stroke and loses his ability to speak and form words. The heroine is the only one to help him, even when everyone else has given him up to the insane asylum."
1,Mixed Feelings,"This book could have been a great story and had the potential to be a real keeper to read over and over again. The premise was fantastic. However, the book just dragged on and on. The hero of the story, The Duke of Jervaulx, was excellently portrayed. You could easily feel his pain when he is forced into an asylum for the insane. However, the book's heroin, Maddy, was a bit out of control. A devout Quaker, she was torn between the life she always knew and the life with the Duke. While I really liked most of the characters, she just annoyed me to no end. Could she be more indecisive? The book eventually lacked closure with the secondary characters (the blind father and the former mistress) and should have resolved the books main issue of the Duke losing everything or not. For a 532-page book, it should have tied things up a bit neater instead of just the ""love conquers all"" typical ending."
2,A++++,"This is from a mother. Im not crazy about Disney movies. But I saw this on TV and I was hooked. I couldn't leave the TV. Its sweet, has great messages, wonderful acting and a lots of fun music. This was a wonderful movie. I would buy this in a second."
2,"pretty good, but dont buy it yet!","theres probably going to be a 2-disc edition available in october or november, but im just saying that because high school musical released on 1-disc dvd and everyone bought it, and then it came out on 2-disc dvd a few monthes later."
1,Not great,"It does not matter how evenly you attempt to apply this product, you will end up with streaks. Thank goodness I decided to start with my legs...at least I can wear jeans until the stuff wears off."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L'Oreal's towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better. THEY ARE NOT. They don't smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don't make you tanner! I have a dance competition coming up and now have to run out and try to find the L'Oreal product locally. Bottom line? Don't waste your money. Use L'Oreal's towlettes instead.L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes . - Medium Natural Tan"
1,Horrible Machine and customer service,"After having this elliiptical trainer for several months I must say I am very dissapointed with this product and this company. After a month there was a problem with one of the pedals. I called the service line because it is under warranty and the company never answers calls. I was ""on hold"" waiting for the next availbale operator for over an hour. I finally decided to give up and leave a message and an operator did not get back to me two days! Finally after another week Merit did send a technician. The problem was fixed for about a month until the same problem reoccurred. I called Merit again, waited days for a call back, only to be told that my machine is no longer under warranty and would have to pay for all further repairs.This company has no customer service and their products are substandard."
1,Small Wagon,"This is good for a toy only, very small and the handle is short. I was hoping my two and a half year old grand daughter could use it as a wagon to pull her dolls in but the handle was too short even for her. It is sturdy but not good for use as something for the kids to easily tow things in"
2,Perfect Little Red Wagon for Toddlers,"My 11 month old boy loved a simliar small little red wagon at my mom's house. He had been walking for about a month, and was already pulling it around her house whenever we were there. It was still a little too big for him to manage. I was so exited to find this one for him. It is the perfect size for a toddler. I bought it for his first birthday, and it is one of his favorite toys!"
2,jlblake2001,"Very cute and well made toy. Use it for your doll collectibles, or other fun display ideas like a plan holder. Love the idea of putting in a garden bed with plants."
1,Very short handle,"I bought this as a gift for my almost 18 month old nephew for Christmas. The handle was so short that when he tried to pull it even with his arm down all the way, the front wheels came off the ground. I was very disappointed. My son had a Radio Flyer wagon like this when he was almost 2 and the handle was different and longer."
1,Not a toy,I ordered for my nephew who is under two thinking he could put toys in it and pull them around in the wagon. But when I got the wagon I realized it is a item that would work for a basket or to decorate the yard if there were no neighbor kids around. It is not a toy. I am dissappointed as I was looking at the Radio flyer name since my son had a radio flyer when he was a kid maybe it would be a fun toy. It is not a toy even though it comes up under that heading. It belongs in home and garden. I am returning this one to Amazon.
1,Didn't do it for me,After hearing the debut album from Fischer's latest project Triptkon I thought wow I have to check out that Apollyon Sun side project and see what that was all about. I was psyched to find it for a mere two bits brand new from one of Amazon's Marketplace Sellers. I must admit I am glad that is all I paid for it. It just sounds like a poor White Zombie album to me. I think that Celtic Frost (especially the last line up) was top notch and Triptykon has a great future I believe. I know that this was a side project of Tom's and he admitted it was different from his normal style. I gave this one the 40 minute elliptical trainer test on my ITouch at the gym and it didn't keep me pumped although I still finished! I know some reviewers mentioned NIN and other bands that I have heard that this does sound more like and I realized I don't like those bands so I guess it's no surprise I didn't like this one either.
1,Hmm.. Another Stupid Comedy Behind The Mind of Spy Kids,"Yeah... since there's not much to say except it stinks... um.. here's a deleted scene.Kid: They're real!Teacher: No, they're fake!Kid: They're real!Teacher: No, they're fake!Kid: They're real![Some guy with a shark fin breaks through the window.)Guy With Fin: Sorry to wreck the scene, guys! But, this fin is in my skin! AGGHH!!!(Guy with fin dies.)Kid: See, they're real!Teacher: Aw, man. I lost my deal.By the way, that scene is better than the whole movie combined.LOCAL EVIL MONKEY"
1,didnt receive it,I did not receive the product. They do seem like they want to help me find it. They gave me a tracking number. But it didnt locate the package so i am awaiting there response
2,SharkBoy/LavaGirl in 3-D,"This 3-D adventure is truly for children, from the imaginations of children. The special features on the disk include an interview with the father of these children, the producer of the movie. He explained how they worked on the possibilities together, exploring ideas & creating fantasy as they went along to come up with The Adventures.The 3-D glasses (4 pair) that come with the DVD add to the enjoyment of the viewers by adding an interactive element. At certain points throughout the movie the audience is instructed to ""Put on the Glasses"". When the 3-D portion ends the audience is then instructed to ""Remove the Glasses"". This interactive feature, as well as The Adventures themselves, keep the kid-crowd glued to the screen."
1,Possibly the WORST movie ever made!,"I have four kids and usually wouldn't make the time to write one of these reviews, but this movie stunk so bad I felt the need to warn people!!! I spent the first half of the film waiting for some sort of plot to develop,and then I spent the second half of the film wishing it would end. Sharkboy doesn't say much in the movie at all except to unexpectedly yell at lava girl from time to time although they're supposed to be working together. Lava girl is an airhead and without any strong caharacters, and no real plot the movie seems to go in circles and circles and then finally has mercy on all of us viewers and ends. The 3-d was a great idea but I left with the feeling that some producers wanted to make a 3-d film and didn't bother actually writing a storyline before the actors started the movie. Do not subject yourself to this movie under any circumstanes!!!!"
1,Don't we have more respect for kids than this?,"This is the worst acting in a children's movie that I have EVER seen. Nothing matter with the basic idea of the fanciful plot, but everything about the movie, from special effects to horrible acting, makes it the worst of filmmaking EVER. Skip it."
1,unbox turned to crap,I hate to say it but unbox has turned to crap! I still have not viewed this movie. It will not download. It goes to que? whatever it is then nothing. I have no problems downloading the free stuff from Amazon so I dont understand why the paid rentals dont work right.
1,this movie made me cringed & twitch to the max,"bad acting bad storytelling bad everything i wish this movie was never made i strongly disliked this movie it seriously was a waste of time and money to make god this movie is terrible seriously terrible and i thought my movies were bad but this movie takes the cake and just ruins my childhood foreverSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)Star Wars: Fool's Bargain (Novella)Heir to the Empire (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 1)Dark Force Rising (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Book 2)The Last Command (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 3)Specter of the Past (Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn #1)Vision of the Future (Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn, Book 2)Allegiance (Star Wars)Star Wars: Choices of OneOutbound Flight (Star Wars)"
2,Gift for my Great Nephew in Texas,"This was a gift for my Great Nephew, who lives in Texas. I purchased it from my home in Missouri. He loves the movie & was very excited that I bought it for him. I would recommend this to everyone."
2,Excellent for kids,"My kids love this movie. I have a toddler & an elementary student. When they are allowed to watch it, they watch it over and over until they fall asleep. I had to limit their movie time because they only wanted to watch this movie and nothing else. They have been watching this movie since it originally came out. They still love it. If I need to clean up or make them stay settled for a while, I put on this movie and they do not move!"
1,The movie was gay!,Good god I didn't like it. I thought it would be cool but it wasn't. The special effects are really corny and dumb. You didn't miss out anything on the 3D because I didn't see anything realistic with it. My advice don't waste your money on this. I'm 13 years old and if I were 8 I would probably like it but now that I'm 13 I think it's the dumbest movie ever. Spy Kids was okay but this was stupid. Please do not see it!
1,product is awaful!,I orered both catridges and the color cartridge was not recognised and the black smeared as it printed. They sent me two new ones and the black cartridge ran out of ink after just a few pages. Dont watse your money
2,Really Inspiring!,"I hadn't even hit the stories yet, but reading the beginning of the book already had me motivated! It really has great ideas on putting your plans to action, and even making those little ideas in your head seem like they can be reality. Definitely makes you think ""why can't I?"" Suggest this book for anyone, it really helped me get my mind going again when I was lost and down in the dumps about where my life was going."
2,CAN YOU GIVE 1000 STARS?,"I've just listened to MAY THE MUSIC NEVER END--it's breathtaking, matchless, perfect. 5 stars aren't enough and it's priceless. Buy it NOW! May her music never end..."
2,Simply works,The only thing they could improve on with this simple ceiling fan switch is to provide the buyer with a chain instead of a string to extend the length.
2,Ultra French Femmes,"One might say that this collection is a little heavy on covers of English hits like Paint it Black and Nights in White Satin but that is part of its allure. I would take Marie Laforet over Mick Jagger any day and Patricia's Nights in White Satin would make any breathing human melt like butter on a French Riviera beach. Like any great compilation, this collection is a springboard into the world of 1960's Femme French Pop. The obvious is here with Brigitte Bardot but then there is also Jacqueline Taieb, the previously mentioned Marie Laforet and the Chinese/French Tiny Yong which will leave you begging for more, and more there is if you seek them out. The last track on the CD, La Pritemps a Paris by Jacqueline Taeb is unspeakably gorgeous and is worth the price of the CD in itself. Combined with novelty tracks like Dracula by Christine Pilzer this is a complete, precious introduction to 60's French Pop."
2,Really Enjoyed it!,"This was a wonderful read on poetry, and I especially enjoyed the creative imagery, the recognition of the meaning and value of work and the subtle weaving metaphors as the author worked to uncover the underlying truths of all of our lives."
1,Disappointing PC interface/software,"The device works well enough, but I am disappointed it is not a continual feed, and some of the info must be dug out from several menu layers.The primary disappointment for me is that the units requires a SERIAL port to communicate with a PC. A SERIAL PORT? What is this 1985? Come on guys - get to the age of USB - or even better - wireless. Serial port? You must be joking.Even worse - the directions specifically say that it WILL NOT WORK WITH A SERIAL TO USB ADAPTER - and I have found that to be correct.The software leaves much to be desired as well.If I were to do it again... I wouldn't"
2,Love it Love it Love it,"My daughter loves this, she is six months old and we've had it for three weeks now and she is not tired of it. I put it in the kitchen and it is great while I am fixing dinner. She likes the sounds and can play with all of the toys herself without help. She can even turn the pages of the ""book"" and I had thought that would be too difficult. I completely recommend this product"
1,Faulty leg causing distress for my baby,"I purchased this item for my 6 month old baby and she loved it. It was entertaining for her and kept her busy as she turned herself to play with other items. Then about 2 weeks after buying it, one of the legs began to pop out and cause my baby to become unstable. We now constantly have to pop the leg back into place and it causes much distress for my baby. She will be playing fine and then the legs pops out and she loses her balance and becomes very unhappy. Unless I can get another leg that doesn't pop out, I doubt we will be using this much longer."
2,Fantastic Entertainer,"My daughter started enjoying this around 4-1/2 months though she was too little to touch the ground and some of the toys at that time. However as she has grown...so too has she begun to realize all this toy has to offer. She particularly loves the animal sounds and songs. Her favorite is ""Old McDonald Had a Farm"" and she looks at me every time it plays because I sing it to her. She gets a real kick out of that and that...is pricess!"
1,You can do better,"I am a first time mom and loved the baby einstein line. This is a great product - sturdy, good-looking, but there are better products out there. I own this one, but my mom bought one for her house that has so many better features. My daughter got bored with these toys FAST. And lets face it, they get dirty. Evenflo has removable and REPLACABLE toys. You can get new ones. And this Baby Einstein one needs the baby to be pretty tall to start using it. Evenflo starts much lower for shorter babies and it lets them jump a little too - something kids love to do. Good product, but better ones out there for less money"
